            "text": "The Coronavirus disease pandemic has steered the global therapeutic research efforts toward the discovery of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) molecules. The role of the viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has been clearly established in SARS-CoV-2 infection through its capacity to bind to the host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2. The antiviral strategies targeting these 2 virus receptors are currently under intense investigation. However, the rapid evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has resulted in numerous mutations in the S-protein posing a significant challenge for the design of S-protein-targeted inhibitors. As an example, the 2 key mutations in the S-protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), L452R, and T478K in the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) confer tighter binding to the host epithelial cells. Marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) demonstrate excellent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 via competitive disruption of the S-protein RBD-HSPG interactions and thus have the potential to be developed into effective prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. In this study, 7 different MSGs were evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in a virus entry assay utilizing a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus coated with S-protein of the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) or the Delta (B.1.617.2) strain. Although all tested MSGs showed strong inhibitory activity against both strains, no correlations between MSG structural features and virus inhibition could be drawn. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

            "text": "Natural evolution of viruses involves multiple genetic mutations. However, only those capable of changing the important protein structure of the virus lead to consequences in terms of virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, and severity of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) (Wuhan-Hu-1) strain has acquired many crucial mutations over a short period of time, giving rise to various VOCs. Delta variant (B.1.617.2), first identified in India in October 2020 (WHO database), has so far been the most aggressive variant. The high pathogenicity of delta variant is linked to the 9 amino acid mutations in its S-protein: T19R, G142D, FR156-157del, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N. The L452R, T478K, and P681R are key mutations because they result in significant immune evasion and high transmissibility. The L452R mutation is present in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region of the S-protein involved in binding to the ACE2 receptor. This mutation aids in the stabilization of the S-protein-ACE2 interaction, therefore increasing the molecular binding affinity and viral infectivity. Substitution of the threonine with lysine in T478K changes the electrostatic surface charge of the viral RBD, strengthening the ACE2 binding. The mutation P681R has been shown to increase proteolytic cleavage caused by furin between the S1 and S2 subunits of the SARS-CoV-2Â S-protein, thus increasing the rate of viral fusion and increasing the spread of infection. The L452R mutation has been shown to significantly contribute to the immune escaping ability of the virus when examined against vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma.",

As S-protein binding to the host cell surface HSPGs is one of the first and critical steps in the establishment of the infection, abrogation of the same molecular complex would be able to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The competitive inhibition of S-protein-HSPG binding by administering sulfated glycans like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or GAG mimetics, e.g. marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) by our group and others, has shown a significant decrease in the SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain). In our previous studies with Wuhan-Hu-1 strain S-protein RBD, significant inhibition was achieved by MSGs. Therefore, it is logical to start testing the MSGs against emerging VOCs. In the current study, we investigate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of MSGs comparatively against both the SARS-CoV-2 WT (Wuhan-Hu-1) and Delta (B.1.617.2) strains to examine if the acquired mutations in the Delta variant would lead to any change in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of the MSGs.",

C) Bar plots represent percentage cell viability of HEK-293T-hACE2 cells when treated with the above mentioned sulfated glycans at the highest examined concentration of 50Â mg/L. All sugars were nonsignificant (PÂ >Â 0.05) except HfSF (PÂ <Â 0.05) indicated by *. ",

Although each sulfated glycan showed its own inhibitory capacity, the inhibitory activities of the MSGs strains were generally similar and (slightly) weaker, respectively, against Wuhan and Delta strains. No correlation between structural features (sulfation pattern, MW, monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage, and/or anomeric configuration) and anticoronaviral activity was observed. Nevertheless, the current study provides evidence for the maintenance of inhibitory activity of MSGs against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains.",

Virus titers were confirmed by enumerating GFP-positive transduced cells in a dilution series under a fluorescence microscope (EVOS-FL, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and by multiplying by the dilution factor with the volume plated. Serial dilutions (50, 5, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005Â mg/L) of the test MSGs were made in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in triplicates to the final volume of 100Â Î¼L in each well.
