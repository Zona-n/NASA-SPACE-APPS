The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 provide a major step forward in reducing COVID-19’s impact. However, the pandemic is ongoing, and the continued viral transmission allows for accumulation of mutations in the viral genome, which can provide advantages in replication, immune escape, increased transmissibility, or diagnostic detection failure. With the quickly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and the slow rate of vaccination globally, it is critical to fully understand this novel virus and disease.",

There are some mutations that occur in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which is the portion most exposed on the virus surface. There is evidence for immune selection in this region, and preliminary evidence that at least one of these changes (delH69/delV70) could improve fitness.

Furthermore, there is increased variability of viral cellular tropism with the emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Eta, Iota, Kappa, 1.617.3, Mu, Zeta, and in particular, Delta and Omicron, as well as the various lineages of each variant. This is related with SARS-CoV-2’s mutation ability affecting its antigenic phenotype to circumvent immunity. The spike protein mediates attachment of the virus to host cell-surface receptors and fusion between virus and cell membranes; it is also the principal target for neutralizing antibodies generated following infection, and is the component for both mRNA and adenovirus-based vaccines. Several studies have contributed to the current understanding of how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein affect neutralization and emergence of new strains, which include studies of traditional escape mutation, targeted characterization of particular mutations, and wider investigations of large numbers of circulating variants. These are active areas of research, in particular given the continued emergence of new lineages of new variants. A study of human, bat, non-human primate, and mouse cell lines showed various cell types were susceptible to the virus. These included pulmonary, intestinal, hepatic, renal, and neuronal, with cell lines expressing the hACE-2 receptor (hACE-2) having a generally greater viral load. Although cell lines do not reflect physiological conditions, this research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect many cell types, and that hACE-2 provides a critical entry mechanism. Epithelial, vascular endothelial, pancreas, and mucosal cell types can all be infected by the virus.",

Experimental data on the relation between Ca2+ signaling and SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication is sparse.

The fusion protein (FP) of MERS-CoV binds to one Ca2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein has two FP domains, FP1 and FP2, and binds to two Ca2+ ions for host cell entry. SARS-CoV-2 appears to affect cellular function by altering the host Ca2+ homeostasis in ways that promote viral infection and reproduction (see Fig. 3). One mechanism is through disruption of calcium channels and pumps (e.g., voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated calcium channels, store-operated calcium channels, transient receptor-potential ion channels, and Ca2+-ATPase). This leads to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, resulting in virus-induced cell lysis. The interaction between the virus and VGCCs may also promote virus-host cell fusion for entry.",

PRRs identify damage- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs, respectively). SARS-CoV-2 infects the cell via the endosomal compartment, and may activate TLRs, such as TLR4, resulting in increased NF-κB activity and expression. The MyD88-mediated TRIF activation of TLR downstream pathways triggers the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), and IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF-7), resulting in the expression of innate immunity proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], interleukin-6 [IL- 6], TNF-α) and interferons (IFNs). Continuous activation of TLR can increase MyD88 and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which then can further activate NF-κB. RNA viruses are detected by several sensors, such as TLRs 3, 7 and 8. TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 single stranded RNA. In addition to ssRNA and dsRNA, viral proteins can act as PAMPS and potentiate inflammatory signaling through the stimulation of surface TLRs. Interestingly, in SARS-CoV-2, TLR2 is a critical mediator of envelope protein detection and driver of pathogenesis through inflammatory process augmentation. Some individuals with severe COVID-19 have mutations in genes associated with type I and III IFN pathways. Ten percent of individuals that progress to severe COVID-19 pneumonia display elevated amounts of neutralizing antibodies against type I IFN-α2 and IFN-ω; these antibodies are not present in healthy or asymptomatic individuals. Of note, albeit TLR3 activation is critical for viral clearance, TLR3 hyperactivation can lead to a cytokine storm and the subsequent severe COVID-19. Other receptors are also involved in SARS-CoV-2 recognition, such as the proteins of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5). Once inside the cell, double strand viral RNA can be recognized by RIG-I/MDA5, thus initiating an antiviral response through mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS). MAVS activated the downstream pathways, IκB kinase α/β (IKK) and TBK1/IKKε, leading to translocation of NF-κB and/or IRF3 into the nucleus and induction of genes involved with innate antiviral immunity and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).",

Specifically, in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus blocks the transcription of discrete groups of mitochondrial genes from major bioenergetic organs, while upregulation occurs in others as a compensatory mechanism to rescue the damage occurring in the major bioenergetic organs. This demonstrated a dynamic evolution of mitochondrial gene expression and cellular energetics as the virus progresses from one organ to the next. Transcriptomic changes in the nasopharyngeal infected samples revealed that during initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, nDNA coded mitochondrial genes are blocked and the co-inhibited genes were found to group together as components of preassembly modules of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, II, III, IV and V. At the time of death for COVID-19 patients, we showed virtually all mitochondrial function were inhibited in the heart, suggesting cardiac mitochondrial dysfunction in longer term COVID-19 pathology. In addition, mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response were highly dysregulated throughout all organs. Lastly, mitochondrial inhibition was shown to activate HIF-1α and its target genes shifting cellular metabolism away from catabolism and towards viral synthesis. Our results indicate that manipulation of mitochondrial function may be an important approach for mitigating the severity of COIVID-19.",

An investigation of SARS-CoV-2 metabolism during the initial 48-hours post viral infection showed that amino acid availability and synthesis are altered, de novo purine synthesis intermediates are accumulated, intracellular glucose and folate are depleted, and lactate levels are elevated.

The subsequent disease events will reverberate across the body’s cells and organs. This will be the subject of our Part 2 review (in preparation).",
