            "text": "A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.",

            "text": " Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis (Lemaitre and Hoffmann). The Drosophila Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature (Wang and Ligoxygakis). Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the Drosophila and human immune systems are analogous (Kimbrell and Beutler). In Drosophila, the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors (Babcock et al.; Brennan et al.; Gateff; Rizki and Rizki; Tepass et al.; Vass and Nappi). The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph (Aggrawal and Silverman).",

            "text": " Drosophila produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells (Crozatier and Meister). Plasmatocytes account for ~95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute ~5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates, Drosophila blood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland (Evans et al.). Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx (Evans and Banerjee; Mandal et al.).",

Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg (Luo et al.; Meister and Lagueux; Minakhina and Steward; Stofanko et al.). Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK–STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK (Asha et al.; Li; Minakhina and Steward; Zettervall et al.). Some other genes with this mutant phenotype are air 8, encoding ribosomal protein s6 (Watson et al.); black pearl, encoding a DnaJ homolog (Becker et al.); l(3)malignant blood neoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology (Gateff); yantar, encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein (Sinenko et al.); and the Polycomb group gene multi sex combs (Remillieux-Leschelle et al.).

            "text": "In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor gene dappled (dpld) (Rodriguez et al.). Enhancer detector expression of dappled was high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of dappled produced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut (Rodriguez et al.). A distinguishing feature of dappled mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification of dappled as a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin (Schenkman and Jansson). Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones (Locuson et al.; Miller; Yamazaki and Shimada). Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, and dappled provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize the dappled mutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect the dappled hemocyte phenotype.",

Sequencing of the flanking DNA and alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 5′ UTR of CG2140 (Tweedie et al.), with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned dappled as CG1624 based on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not complement the 142/2 insertion (Spradling et al.). We therefore investigated this discrepancy in the identification of dappled. The 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences for the k08815 insertion are 3′-AQ034113 and 5′-AQ025871. Alignment of these flanking sequences on the latest Drosophila genome sequence, however, places them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3′ and 5′ insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (pRsyII) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig. 1). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig. 1). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5′ UTR and intron of CG2140/dappled, respectively (Fig. 1).",

One related Drosophila sequence has been identified, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r; http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only 134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the dappled encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and 76% identity with housefly cytochrome b5 (Fig. 3). Overall, the selected mammals and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions.

It is unlikely that this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because flies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low fertility.

As noted above, plasmatocytes in dappled tumors express the hemese-Gal4 driver, which does not express in the lymph glands, further indicating an early developmental origin for these cells. Additionally, the lymph glands appear normal, at least at a gross level, and only one dappled enhancer trap expresses in the lymph glands (Rodriguez et al.). We analyzed 1 kb of the dappled upstream region for potential binding by blood cell, lymph gland, and other transcription factors using the Transfac database (Wingender) provided by Biobase Biological Databases (http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home). Among the transcription factor binding sites are many that are predicted to be T cell factor/pan binding sites (Brunner et al.), consistent with blood cell expression, and tinman/Nkx2.5 binding sites (Kimbrell et al.), suggesting lymph gland expression (Table 3).

We hypothesized that modulation of the dappled phenotype could be used as an in vivo assay for cytochrome b5 related effects of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. We are therefore screening compounds with a known connection to cytochrome P450s and/or anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties for enhancement or suppression of the dappled melanotic phenotype. Initial studies with aspirin and the corticosteroid dexamethasone are negative (data not shown), whereas curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, has consistently shown an enhancement of the melanotic phenotype (Table 5; Fig. 7). Adult dappled mutants that have been raised (egg to adult) on curcumin-supplemented food have an enhanced melanotic phenotype, showing more and/or larger melanotic tumors (Table 5). The enhanced phenotype of the dappled mutants is already evident in the larval stages (Fig. 7). Adult dappled heterozygotes, however, do not develop a melanotic phenotype when raised on curcumin (Table 5). Since both the heterozygotes and heteroallelic mutants have some reduction in dappled transcript levels, the effects of curcumin may depend on the exact amount of cytochrome b5 protein that is produced.

The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reflected in the difficulties and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting oxygenation and inflammation (Hegesh et al.; Umbreit). Mutation of cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common (Davis et al.). In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia may also have been associated with hormonal defects (Giordano et al.). With the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level (Lin et al.), cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been identified. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a tissue-specific knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed (Finn et al.). With our studies of dappled, Drosophila now provides a tractable genetic model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues.",

Mutation of one copy of dappled results in a significant increase in the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of dappled melanotic nodules is a Class 2 reaction in the classification of Watson et al., in which Class 2 represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. Kurian et al. hypothesized that functionally significant genetic variability in cytochrome b5 occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression (Kurian et al.).",

The driver used was hemese-Gal4, which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the lymph glands (Markus et al.; Zettervall et al.). Interestingly, the sessile hemocytes are a newly discovered hematopoietic site and appear to be the main developmental origin of lamellocytes (Markus et al.). This site of expression may be the key factor in rescuing the dappled melanotic nodule phenotype. Rescue of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the hemese-Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the first hematopoietic wave, both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because hemese-Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. However, dappled also increased the number of hemocytes from the second hematopoietic wave. Hemocytes from both developmental origins, embryonic and lymph gland, require dappled in order to be produced in normal amounts. It is an interesting question as to whether the plasmatocyte increase in dappled mutants can be independently controlled in the first and second hematopoietic waves.",

Since dappled encodes a cytochrome b5, the obvious choice would be apoptosis rather than overproliferation. There are two problems with this choice: it is mitochondrial cytochrome b5 that is established in the canonical cytochrome C signaling apoptotic pathway, and the use of that pathway by Drosophila is controversial (Kornbluth and White; Means and Hays; Oberst et al.; Ow et al.). Microsomal cytochrome b5, however, has also been suggested to be involved in cytochrome C mediated apoptosis (Davydov), and Drosophila may have its own version of apoptotic signaling that uses the dappled cytochrome b5. Further, blood cells are well described for their role in response to apoptotic cells, but the role of their own apoptosis in development and infection is not clear (Bruckner et al.; Crozatier and Meister; Lemaitre and Hoffmann).",

There are many potential mechanisms for dappled to affect overproliferation, especially given the increasingly complex functions of plasmatocytes (Charroux and Royet). One option consistent with cytochrome b5 function, and potentially the dappled effects on fertility, is that hormonal signaling of hematopoiesis is affected. In that case, however, rescue of the dappled blood cell phenotype would be predicted by adding back wild-type dappled expression in the steroid-producing ring gland (Gilbert) rather than hemocytes. Alternatively, dappled expression could rescue a steroid-processing step in the hemocytes.",

More specifically, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, http://www.droidb.org). Among its activities, Traf6 is an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, and mutants are immune response defective (Cha et al.; Wu and Arron). Cytochrome b5 involvement with Traf6 is a testable hypothesis through analysis of genetic interaction between dappled and Traf6 mutants.",

Curcumin is widely studied for its potential as a nutritional pharmaceutical (Duvoix et al.; Jagetia and Aggarwal). Among its many activities, which are mainly anti-inflammatory and anticancer, curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450s, down-regulates NFkB, and affects apoptosis and the cell cycle (Alpers; Appiah-Opong et al.; Kwon et al.; Sa and Das). Curcumin enhanced the melanotic phenotype of dappled mutants. This effect of curcumin is consistent with NFkB involvement, but there are other alternatives, in particular, cytochrome P450 processing in the fat body.",

            "text": "Mutation of dappled showed similar effects in females and males, but an unexpected consequence of our studies is the finding that females and males differ significantly in the number of circulating blood cells. In humans, a difference between the sexes in the numbers of blood cell types is well established, but the effects are unclear (Blum and Pabst; Huppert et al.; Reichert et al.). In both humans and Drosophila, there are differences in the immune responses between the sexes that affect health (Dale et al.; Marriott and Huet-Hudson; Shames; Taylor and Kimbrell; Ye et al.; Zandman-Goddard et al.), and the blood cell number differential may be part of mediating the immune response differences. Recently, Drosophila hemocytes have been shown to directly signal immune induction of the fat body, and a reduced number of hemocytes resulted in less immune induction (Shia et al.). In Drosophila, the increase in hemocytes of dappled and females may result in higher immune induction, which may or may not provide a healthier condition. For example, human females typically have a more robust immune response but also a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders (Dale et al.; Zandman-Goddard et al.).",
