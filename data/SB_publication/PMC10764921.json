            "text": "Understanding the response of plants to varied gravitational conditions is vital for developing effective food production in space bioregenerative life support systems. This study examines the impact of altered gravity conditions on the growth and morphological responses of Wolffia globosa (commonly known as “water lentils” or “duckweed”), assessing its potential as a space crop. Although an experiment testing the effect of simulated microgravity on Wolffia globosa has been previously conducted, for the first time, we investigated the effect of multiple gravity levels on the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa plants. The plant responses to simulated microgravity, simulated partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity environments were evaluated using random positioning machines and the large-diameter centrifuge. As hypothesized, we observed a slight reaction to different gravitational levels in the growth and morphological traits of Wolffia globosa. The relative growth rates (RGR) of plants subjected to simulated microgravity and partial gravity were reduced when compared to those in other gravity levels. The morphological analysis revealed differences in plant dimensions and frond length-to-width ratios under diverse gravity conditions. Our findings showed that Wolffia globosa is responsive to gravitational changes, with its growth and morphological adaptations being slightly influenced by varying gravitational environments. As for other crop species, growth was reduced by the microgravity conditions; however, RGR remained substantial at 0.33 a day. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of Wolffia globosa as a space crop and its adaptability to diverse gravitational conditions, contributing to the development of sustainable food production and bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration missions.",

Due to its rapid growth rate, high protein content, and nutritional value, it has emerged as a promising candidate for sustainable food production, particularly in agriculturally challenging regions. This unique plant has recently garnered attention also as a potential bioregenerative life support system (BLSS) candidate, offering traits that align with closed-loop, resource-efficient systems like those adopted for the ESA MELiSSA Loop. Nevertheless, as for other candidate space crops to assess the suitability of Wolffia’s in space cultivation and its ability to recycle resources efficiently, further laboratory tests investigating growth, nutrition, and genetic responses under extreme conditions are fundamental.",

Space limitations within onboard test facilities, such as the International Space Station or orbiting vectors, often restrict the number of replicates, making studies under these conditions even more demanding. However, cost-effective alternatives exist in the form of facilities that simulate microgravity and partial gravity levels by continuously altering the gravitational vector. These facilities offer higher replicate numbers and serve as robust testbeds for experiments involving different gravity levels.",

Hypergravity is most prominent during the manuvers of take-off and landing phases of spacecraft. These brief yet intense episodes of increased gravitational force can influence various aspects of plant biology and growth.

Considering these constraints, we designed and developed the experimental hardware using the free available software SketchUp® (Fig. 1). Due to the constraints described before, multiwell plates had to be stacked vertically. This setup minimises the distance of the two centres of mass of both multiwells so that the difference in acceleration can be neglected.

            "text": "The effects of altered gravity, especially microgravity (whether real or simulated), on higher plant species have been the subject of numerous scientific studies. Wolffia globosa is the smallest higher plant, and its morphology is entirely distinct from other higher plants. It doesn’t exhibit the typical morphology of roots, stems, and leaves but only has a frond that cannot be associated with any of the three main organs. The results of previous studies on the effects of altered gravity on plant growth are not directly comparable to this species. Most of the research conducted focuses on the interactions between microgravity and roots. Wolffia globosa is famously known as a rootless plant. To further complicate matters, their rootless nature makes comparison with what has been studied so far challenging. Additionally, while microgravity has often been reported as a limiting growth factor for plants, results from tests performed under hypergravity are disagreeing. Studies on the nucleolar activity or on the elongation of hypocotyls in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus, showed a decrease in growth rates. At the same time, other results suggest that hypergravity might not affect growth. In our experiment, the 2g and 4g hypergravity treatments manifest an increasing (although not statistically significant) trend in growth rates compared to the control treatment (Fig. 6). This possible positive response to hypergravity treatments opens up interesting possibilities for future studies and potential applications in space agriculture but requires new ad hoc tests, eventually applying higher levels of hypergravity to amplify the phenomenon. In such a scenario, hypergravity conditions could be leveraged to enhance plant productivity and biomass accumulation in controlled environments, such as space stations.",

Subsequently, the sim-Moon g, sim-µg, 2 g, and 4 g treatments followed in terms of frond length. These results suggest that both simulated microgravity and simulated Moon’s partial gravity have don’t have an impact on frond elongation. Furthermore, when analysing the ratio in relation to the longer side, significant differences were observed among the gravity treatments, indicating distinct frond shapes. The sim-µg treatment resulted in the most elongated frond shape, followed by the sim-Moon g, 1 g, 2 g, and 4 g treatments. These findings provide compelling evidence supporting the significant influence of gravity on the morphological characteristics of Wolffia globosa fronds. The observed variations in frond length and shape among the treatments underscore the role of gravity in shaping plant growth and development. Specifically, the sim-µg treatment consistently induced the most pronounced changes, suggesting its potential as a key factor in determining frond morphology. These results contribute to our understanding of how different gravity environments impact the growth and shape of Wolffia globosa, highlighting the importance of considering gravity conditions in cultivating and manipulating these plants for various space applications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these morphological changes could provide valuable insights into the plant's ability to perceive and respond to gravitational cues.",

As already mentioned by the authors of the up-mentioned work, the enhanced growth might be linked to better utilisation of dissolved oxygen and organic substances in the growth medium due to the type of cultivation system they have employed. The varying responses observed among different gravity treatments in our experiment could be attributed to the interplay between genetic variability within the Lemnaceae family and the specific environmental conditions experienced by each individual plant. Notably, the genus Wolffia comprises numerous species with significant genetic diversity. Testing the effects of altered gravity on only one clone of Wolffia globosa, as done in our experiment, provides a valuable starting point but may not fully capture the entire range of responses within the genus Wolffia. Further investigations involving multiple Wolffia species and clones are warranted to explore the full extent of the species' reaction to altered gravity and better understand the role of genetic variability in shaping their growth patterns.",

This genetic difference suggests that Wolffia species have evolved alternative mechanisms to perceive and respond to gravity cues, which may explain the distinct growth patterns exhibited under altered gravitational conditions. Furthermore, to some degree, the enhanced growth rate seen under the hypergravity treatment could be attributed to gravity resistance genes such as PTH2. Our results partially confirmed the expected limited reaction to gravity also of Wolffia globosa. The adaptability of Wolffia globosa to different gravitational conditions supported the hypothesis that the loss of gravity-sensing genes reported in the sister species Wolffia australiana might also occur in Wolffia globosa.
