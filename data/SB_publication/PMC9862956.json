These applications rely on conducting whole-organism phenotypic assays involving animal behavior and locomotion. In this study, we report a 3D printed compact imaging platform (CIP) that is integrated with a smart-device camera for the whole-organism phenotyping of C. elegans. The CIP has no external optical elements and does not require mechanical focusing, simplifying the optical configuration. The small footprint of the system powered with a standard USB provides capabilities ranging from plug-and-play, to parallel operation, and to housing it in incubators for temperature control. We demonstrate on Earth the compatibility of the CIP with different C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets on glass slides and microfluidic chips. We validate the system with behavioral and thrashing assays and show that the phenotypic readouts are in good agreement with the literature data. We conduct a pilot study with mutants and show that the phenotypic data collected from the CIP distinguishes these mutants. Finally, we discuss how the simplicity and versatility offered by CIP makes it amenable to future C. elegans investigations on the International Space Station, where science experiments are constrained by system size, payload weight and crew time. Overall, the compactness, portability and ease-of-use makes the CIP desirable for research and educational outreach applications on Earth and in space.",

Considering these needs, we designed and built a compact imaging platform (CIP).

The top section houses the iPod Touch camera (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA), and the bottom section houses the C. elegans substrate, 6500 k pure white LED lights (Power Practical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and a 6000-rpm cooling fan (Wathai, China) (Figure 1b). Thin rectangular slots of 20 mm × 2 mm are provided on the top and bottom sections, acting as air vents to achieve thermal equilibrium when the CIP is placed in a temperature-controlled environment. The thermal management system of the CIP works independently of the gravitational environment (ground or microgravity), due to active cooling and proper ventilation present in the system.",

Autofocusing is achieved using a 3rd-party app (FiLMiC Pro, Seattle, WA, USA) on the iPod Touch. This app also allows for adjustment of the magnification, field of view and frame rate of video acquisition. The fixed focal distance configuration gives a field of view of 15 mm × 23 mm to 38 mm × 68 mm depending on the optical 3x zoom available on the app. Videos can be acquired at 1080p resolution with a frame rate of 3–30 fps, or time-lapse imaging can be performed with a delay ranging from 1–60 s.",

Additionally, the iPod Touch has the capacity to store up to ≈250 GB worth of data, allowing for recording of up to ≈810,000 images which enables short-term (e.g., about 1800 movies of 1.5 min duration at 5 fps) and long-term behavioral assays (e.g., about 45 h at 5 fps). Image acquisition aspects such as autofocusing and video capture rate can be easily controlled using the installed app. Finally, conducting science experiments with specialized hardware on the ISS requires significant astronaut training; however, the crew is familiar with using smartphone devices and associated apps, making our smart-device approach crew-friendly for spaceflight experiments.",

This new capability allows multiple assays with the same or different strains to be conducted simultaneously in the same substrate or in different substrates (plates, microfluidic chips etc.). The ability to house the CIP in an incubator is also conducive for spaceflight investigations, as the ISS accommodates several incubators. For example, the Space Automated Bioproducts Laboratory (BioServe Space Technologies, Boulder, CO, USA) is a dual-function freezer/incubator that supports life-sciences experiments on the ISS with a temperature control of −5 to 43 °C and accommodates 2 USB ports.",

Each of these substrates have different refractive indices, optical path lengths and interfaces, which can alter the transmission of light and therefore can affect image contrast.

Figure 2 shows representative images obtained from the three substrates using the CIP. We find that the images from these substrates are of sufficient quality such that the adult animals can be easily segmented using standard image processing software (ImageJ, wrMTrck plugin). Under optimal imaging conditions, we find day 1 gravid adults to occupy ≈50 pixels when housed in the three substrates. This resolution allows these animals to be segmented easily against the background.

The design of the CIP makes it an enclosed system housing the C. elegans substrates, since the top section (containing the smart-device camera) is brought in contact with the bottom section during imaging. The Initial trials showed that the main internal source of heat that the C. elegans substrates experience in the CIP is the radiant energy from the array of LED lights in the bottom section, which leads to an increase in temperature. To address this issue, we created ventilation slots in the enclosure and installed a cooling fan at the left wall of the bottom section. The forced convection from the cooling fan draws air from the ambient and distributes it through the ventilation slots.",

As shown in Figure 3b,c, in less than 2 h, the temperature stabilizes for all three set temperature conditions, with a variation that is less than 0.5 °C.

Using a syringe, approximately 65 animals were aspirated from the plate and loaded inside the chip using the loading port.
