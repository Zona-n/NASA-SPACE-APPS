This was tested, employing three methods of measurement: two-arm matching, one-arm pointing and one-arm repositioning, carried out during parabolic flight. In hypergravity (1.8G), position sense errors in a matching task increased significantly from the value during horizontal flight (1G) of + 2.5° (± 3.8° SD), to + 3.5° (± 3.3°). For pointing, errors increased significantly from + 9.1° (± 4.4°) to + 11.2° (± 4.4°). In microgravity (0G), matching errors fell significantly to + 0.35° (± 3.5°), while in pointing the fall was not significant. For repositioning, there were no significant changes in errors in either hypergravity or microgravity. It is proposed that the errors in matching and pointing are a consequence of the force of gravity acting at the elbow joint to alter the position signal coming from muscle and joint receptors. For repositioning, memory of the test angle was stored centrally, to be reproduced independently of any changes in gravity.",

Position sense was measured, using a two-arm position matching task, during the rises and falls in gravity during parabolic flight. However, rather than studying position sense directly, the authors made observations on the illusory changes in perceived limb position in response to muscle vibration (Goodwin et al.). The method has the advantage of producing large changes in position sense for which the influence of gravity can be readily studied. Other reports on position sense in microgravity were those of Bock and Bringoux et al..",

Spindle rates can be altered by means of muscle length changes and by fusimotor activity. The authors proposed that gravity-dependent vestibular stimulation led to changes in fusimotor activation of spindles in forearm muscles and this altered the vibration responses. Our own hypothesis for the gravity effects was based on the findings of Bringoux et al.. They showed that errors were made in a reaching task, carried out during parabolic flight, where participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps stretched across the arm before and during the movement recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense.",

In hypergravity, torque levels at the joint would be expected to increase, to raise the joint receptor component of the position signal and therefore lead to increases in position sense values above those for 1G levels. Similarly, a fall in joint torque would lower the joint receptor component and therefore reduce position sense values below 1G values. With this mechanism in mind, we compared position sense values using the three methods and asked the question, were all three similarly affected by the changes in gravity?",

Each setup’s height could be adjusted individually to suit the participant. In front of each participant were two paddles, which could be moved freely in the sagittal plane over a range of 90° from the horizontal (0°) to the vertical position (90°). Mechanical stops prevented movements beyond this range. Both paddles could be automatically moved to predefined angles by integrated motors. For one of the two paddles and its motor, an electromagnetic clutch was incorporated which, when released, allowed the paddle to move freely, without any frictional or inertia effects from the motor. Indicated angles were recorded by potentiometers with an angular resolution of ± 0.3°. Selected positions of both paddles could be locked in place by motor brakes. At one end of each paddle was a soft elbow support (with a Velcro strap to hold the elbow in position) and at the other end there was a padded hand rest with a handle. The elbow rest was positioned so that the elbow pivot point and the paddle’s axis of rotation were aligned. The distance between elbow rest and hand rest as well as the distance between handle and paddle could be individually adjusted.",

To begin with, forearm muscles had to be conditioned, to account for spindle thixotropic properties. With both paddles locked in position, the participant carried out isometric contractions of elbow flexors of both arms, followed by isometric contractions of elbow extensors. The contractions were approximately 20% of maximum, 0.5s in duration. To do that, participants were asked to pull both arms towards their body (“pull”), or to push them away, (“push”). When participants had relaxed, the experimental trials were started. One paddle was unlocked and the passive forearm of the reference arm was automatically moved in the direction of extension to the test angle and held in that position. Then the clutch of the other paddle opened and they were asked to bring the indicator arm into a matching position. Participants were told to move the indicator to a position where the two arms felt aligned.",

The present study has shown that for position sense measured by matching or pointing, changes in gravity had significant effects on the measured values. For repositioning, the data suggested that position sense values were unresponsive to changes in gravity. Given these differences in outcomes, the current observations emphasize the importance of declaring the method used whenever position sense is measured, both at ground level and under conditions of weightlessness. Our observations suggest that of the three methods used in the present study, with the method of repositioning, it is not possible to reveal any disturbance of position sense by gravity and that if gravity effects were to be studied further, the preferred methods to use would have to be matching or pointing.",

Since muscle spindles are the only known sensory receptors to exhibit thixotropy (Proske et al.), such patterns were interpreted as evidence for spindles being involved in generation of the position signals. There was evidence of spindle participation in position sense measured with two-arm matching and one-arm pointing, while for repositioning the evidence was weak. Such an outcome reflected a similar pattern to that seen with gravity effects in the present study. It tempted us to say that when spindle participation in a measurement could be demonstrated, this made it likely that gravity effects could be revealed as well. It was as though in a measurement of position sense the gravity effects were linked in some way with the participation of spindles. That conclusion strengthened our view that spindles played a key role in the observed gravity-dependent changes in position sense.",

As mentioned, it is believed that muscle spindles provide the position signal during movements about a joint; an increase in spindle discharge signals a longer muscle, a more flexed or extended joint (Matthews). We suggest that there is a spindle discharge - joint angle relation for the determination of position sense, established during development (Held and Bauer). If, as a result of an increase in gravity, the position signal increases, this would be expressed in both arms, the reference arm sitting at 60° and the indicator moved by the participant. Since the reference remains fixed at the test angle, the signal coming from it would be higher than expected from 1G values. The indicator would move towards the position of the reference, until a point was reached where the signals from the two arms matched. For elbow flexors this would be a position where the indicator arm was more extended than the reference. If spindle discharge in elbow flexors decreases in microgravity, this would lead to a fall in position errors, producing values for elbow extension below those for 1G levels.",

In an arm reaching task it was shown by Bringoux et al. that during parabolic flight reaching errors were made with changes in gravity. Participants overshot the target in hypergravity and undershot it in microgravity. Adding gravity-like torque, by means of elastic straps, stretched across the arm before and during the movement, recovered participants’ performance in microgravity to resemble that in normal gravity. The authors postulated that in microgravity the increased joint torque generated by the elastic straps enhanced arm position sense. One possible reason for this was an increase in skeletomotor activity required to overcome the additional torque generated by the straps and this would be accompanied by co-activated fusimotor activity that raised spindle discharges.",

            "text": "We have suggested an alternate explanation. The normal position signal, especially when generated near the flexion or extension limits of a joint’s working range, is likely to include inputs from both spindles and joint receptors (Proske; Proske and Weber). Joint receptors have an “activation angle” where they begin to generate a maintained discharge, which in animal preparations is 15°-20° short of the limit of movement at the joint. Therefore, when a position is adopted, which is getting closer to the joint limit, and the activation angle has been exceeded, there will be signal mixing from two sources, stretched spindles and activated joint receptors. The details have been spelt out in Proske. When hypergravity imposes extra torque on the joint, the activation angle will be moved further towards the middle of the movement range, increasing the opportunity for mixing, thereby raising the joint receptor component of the position signal. In microgravity, if the arm becomes weightless, there will be no standing torque on the joint and, as a consequence, joint receptor input will fall, lowering the position signal. Stretching elastic straps across the joint would increase joint torque and raise the joint receptor component of the position signal. That, in turn, would recover position sense values in microgravity to normal levels. To further test these ideas we plan, in the future, to measure position sense in microgravity with joint torque raised by means of elastics stretched across the elbow joint.",

It suggested that in normal gravity there was an offset, in the direction of arm extension, in the measured values of pointing errors. One possible explanation is that for pointing the proprioceptive information coming from the hidden reference arm must be converted to a visual frame of reference to guide the pointing arm. Such a conversion comes with additional errors when compared with a purely proprioceptive measurement (Darling et al.). We suggest that such an offset was present in the parabolic measurements.

The data showed that this did not alter repositioning errors. If spindles had been involved, it should have led to increases in position errors.

Assuming the existence of a body schema as the central repository of spatial information, how is the communication carried out between the body periphery and central sites?
