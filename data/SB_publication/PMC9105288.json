This positive curvature occurs at the base of the hypocotyl and is followed by the typical negative gravity-induced curvature. We investigated the role of auxin in both positive and negative hypocotyl curvature by examining the transcription of PIN1, PIN3, IAA5 and ARG1 in curving tissue. We compared tissue extraction of the convex and concave flank with Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE). Based on Ubiquitin1 (UBQ1) as a reference gene, the log (2) fold change of all examined genes was determined. Transcription of the examined genes varied during the graviresponse suggesting that these genes affect differential elongation. The transcription of all genes was upregulated in the lower flank and downregulated in the upper flank during the initial downward curving period. After 48 h, the transcription profile reversed, suggesting that the ensuing negative gravicurvature is controlled by the same genes as the positive gravicurvature. High-spatial resolution profiling using SPGE revealed that the transcription profile of the examined genes was spatially distinct within the curving tissue. The comparison of the hypocotyl transcription profile with the root tip indicated that the tip tissue is a suitable reference for curving hypocotyls and that root and hypocotyl curvature are controlled by the same physiological processes.",

            "text": "Gravitropism is defined as a directional growth response of plants to gravity. This force affects the redistribution of statoliths (starch-filled amyloplasts) in sensory cells and determines the positioning of the plant axis during and after germination. Seedling roots grow towards gravity (aka positive gravitropism) and stems exhibit negative gravitropism and grow in the opposite direction. Although hypocotyls eventually respond as negatively gravitropic, we have previously shown that young hypocotyls of Brassica rapa and other dicotyledonous plants exhibit positive gravitropism. This reorientation is independent of the root cap and amplifies the root graviresponse. The mechanism of this atypical, early curvature has not yet been studied. Based on the hypothesis that this curvature is auxin dependent, we investigated the transcription profile of auxin-responsive genes in the curving hypocotyl tissue.",

Auxin originating from the shoot apex is basipetally (rootward) transported to the stem tissue and basal leaves. In roots, auxin moves through the stele towards the root apex and is redistributed such that basipetal, shootward, transport takes place from the root tip through cortical tissue. The bi-directional auxin transport in roots forms the basis of the “reverse fountain model”. The gravisensitive re-distribution of auxin in roots is initiated by amyloplast relocation and depends on PIN proteins. These proteins determine the direction of IAA flow based on their localization in the plasma membrane. PIN proteins represent a family of proteins that are expressed in specific tissues.",

In roots, PIN3, 4, and 7 are localized on the plasma membrane of different tiers of columella cells; they direct the auxin flow from columella cells to the root cortex. PIN3 and PIN7 move to the plasma membrane along the lower side of columella cells in horizontally reoriented roots, which results in asymmetrical auxin transport. PIN4 in the quiescent center mediates auxin efflux towards the columella cells. The auxin sink in the root cap contributes to the asymmetric auxin distribution in reoriented roots. Polar localization of PIN2 in the plasma membrane of the lateral root cap and epidermal cells directs the auxin flow toward the cortical and epidermal cells. Any auxin asymmetry leads to differential growth in the elongation zone.",

PIN3 is expressed in the endodermis and localizes laterally after two minutes of gravistimulation. PIN3 localization is auxin dependent and a mutation in the PIN3 gene affects differential growth. Hence, PIN3 is an important factor for shoot graviresponse. The PIN3 homologs PIN4 and PIN7 are not expressed in the shoot endodermis and their mutants do not affect the shoot graviresponse. Along with PIN proteins, Altered Response to Gravity (ARG1) is required for the localization of PIN3 during the early stages of hypocotyl graviresponse. A mutation in ARG1 affects early gravisignaling in roots and hypocotyls but can be corrected by the expression of ARG1 in the endodermis of hypocotyls and root caps, which implies that it functions in statocytes. PIN1 re-localization alters the lateral redistribution of auxin and affects the phototropic, and gravitropic response and PIN1 mutants show reduced polar auxin transport (PAT) in Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence axes. Another Auxin Response Element promotes IAA5, a member of Aux/IAA gene family, which has been identified as one of the early and primary response genes that are governed by auxin. ",

Typically, total RNA is extracted by pooling the samples from the same region from several seedlings, which prevents the assessment of gene transcription at precise locations in the tissue/region under consideration. High spatial resolution is desirable as size, age and development is likely to affect transcription and expression profiles. In addition, auxin-induced transcription is likely to follow a temporal profile that cannot be assessed by destructive sampling methods. We used Solid Phase Gene Extraction (SPGE), which relies on mRNA binding to functionalized probes and allows for the repeated sampling of tissue. The temporal and spatial changes of transcription profiles during the initial hypocotyl curvature indicate an auxin-based regulation of positive and negative hypocotyl curvature.",

PIN3 transcription remained constant until four hours after reorientation, followed by continued but reduced upregulation. Although IAA5 increased in the tissue (red line) this gene remained unchanged for SPGE data. Interestingly, the magnitude of upregulation for all genes at 11 h after SPGE extraction was in the range of the earlier tissue data points, except for ARG1. Therefore, a drastic difference in values was observed. Similar to the root tip, we considered the average of the hypocotyl tissue (i.e., the average of top and bottom flanks) and found that the transcription levels of all genes were similar (p = 0.25) for the hypocotyl and root tip regardless of orientation or time after reorientation.",

The connection of these genes with auxin is well established, and at least for PIN1 and PIN3, the transcription pattern over time was identical (Figure 5). The initiation and termination of bending is in line with our observation that the hypocotyl cortex that was probed by SPGE and shows the PIN1 and PIN3 transcription pattern that initially activates the auxin flow to the upper flank, but eventually reverses its lateral polarity to account for the upward orientation of the hypocotyl. The differential elongation corresponds with the observed transcription changes and indicates the dependency of basal hypocotyl curvature on auxin mediated processes. The consistent pattern of initial upregulation along the bottom flank and eventual reversal contradicts the notion that hypocotyls curve negatively gravitropic but are in line with earlier observations that young basal hypocotyls of B. rapa, Linum usitatissimum and other dicots behave similarly to roots and bend positively gravitropic during early growth periods. This behavior reverses as the hypocotyl matures and the orientation of the primary root has been established.",

All examined genes exhibited changes in their transcription in the upper and lower flank (Figure 3 and Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7) of gravicurving hypocotyl over time.

At the midpoint of hypocotyl curvature at 11 h, the auxin asymmetry reaches its maximum and is likely associated with the tipping point that leads to the subsequent reversal of curvature at about 35 h for PIN1 and IAA5, and 30 h for PIN3 and ARG1. This sequence coincides with the reversal of hypocotyl downward curvature. The transition in gene transcription implies a shift in either lateral auxin transport or auxin sensitivity, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species or reductive factors. The significance of this observation is the ensuing change of curvature from positive to negative gravitropic and that it reaches the typical negative gravitropic curvature that is characteristic of mature hypocotyls.",

Another consideration relates to the expression of PIN3 and ARG1 in the endodermis and their involvement in shoot gravitropism via polar auxin transport. Therefore, the signal may not have been maximal as SPGE sampling clearly involved cortical tissue.

Therefore, lateral auxin gradients are likely to not exist at longer times. The comparison between root tip tissue and SPGE sampling shows that both sampling methods detect a similar change in transcription, but tissue samples show larger signals during curvature. Since no concave or convex tissues were sampled, the signal likely reflects a general increase in transcription. SPGE shows a similar increase, but after a significant delay. Both sampling profiles showed a comparable order of activation. The notable exception was IAA5, which was substantially higher in the tissue and remained unchanged in SPGE samples. This discrepancy may stem from a higher mRNA quantity in tissue that was not represented in SPGE extracts such as the developing stele or epidermis. The rapid increase in all transcripts in tissue samples occurred over a longer time in SPGE samples. This increase is not related to curvature but likely illustrates the increase in transcription as the root ages or sensitivities change during vertical orientation. Changes in sensitivity with age have been documented previously and indicate that despite the lack of curvature-specific differences, root tips are a suitable reference for hypocotyl-related changes in gene transcription.

Batches of 40 needles were sonicated sequentially in hexane, acetone, and ethanol for 15 min each, followed by air drying at 80 °C for 15 min. The needles were functionalized by incubation in a mixture of 0.25 mL (3-glycodoxypropyl) trimethoxy silane (3GTMO, SPI-Chem, West Chester, PA, USA) in 0.75 mL xylene and 10 µL diisopropylethylamine in a sealed amber glass vial at 80 °C overnight. The needles were cooled, washed thrice with ethyl acetate, air dried for 10 min and incubated in 1 µM NH2-oligo (dT)15 nucleotides in 0.1 M KOH at 37 °C for 6 h (four needles per 20 µL solution in closed PCR tubes). The functionalized needles were rinsed thrice with deionized water (50 °C) for 5 min each, followed by drying at room temperature. Functionalized needles were inserted for one minute into the hypocotyl and the root tip (Figure 1) four, 11 and 48 h after reorientation. The probes were manually inserted in about 10 s intervals about one mm deep into the cortical tissue in the sequence shown in Figure 1. Hypocotyls were discarded if the probes were placed inaccurately. After 11 h, the curvature reached about 45 degrees, which resulted in stacked arrangement of the loop ends of the probes. Root tips were sampled by inserting the needle into the approximate area of the quiescent center. This approach was chosen as this tissue is not differentiated. For each time point, needles from three different seedlings were combined according to their position and considered one biological sample. Three biological samples (i.e., nine seedlings) were measured.",
