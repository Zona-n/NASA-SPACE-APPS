In this project, HS–virus interactions were targeted by a new fucosylated chondroitin sulfate from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) in order to block human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into cells. Human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HCMV in the presence of PpFucCS and its low molecular weight (LMW) fractions and the virus yield at five days post-infection was assessed. The virus attachment and entry into the cells were visualized by labeling the purified virus particles with a self-quenching fluorophore octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). The native PpFucCS exhibited potent inhibitory activity against HCMV specifically blocking virus entry into the cell and the inhibitory activities of the LMW PpFucCS derivatives were proportional to their chain lengths. PpFucCS and the derived oligosaccharides did not exhibit any significant cytotoxicity; moreover, they protected the infected cells from virus-induced lytic cell death. In conclusion, PpFucCS inhibits the entry of HCMV into cells and the high MW of this carbohydrate is a key structural element to achieve the maximal anti-viral effect. This new marine sulfated glycan can be developed into a potential prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infection.",

            "text": "Earlier, our group showed that HCMV preferentially binds to uniquely sulfated and polymerized HS using its surface glycoprotein B (gB). HS mimetics, including heparin, bind to gB and inhibit HCMV infection by competitively inhibiting virus attachment to the cell surface. Heparin is composed of disaccharide-repeating units (Figure 1A) and is an efficient anticoagulant; it can cause excessive bleeding and thrombocytopenia that necessitate close patient observation and, if necessary, the administration of an antidote (protamine). Two potential solutions to these anticoagulant side effects are using either the naturally potent anti-viral sulfated glycans with lower anticoagulant properties or the dissociation of the anticoagulant and anti-viral properties of the existing heparin. We were able to provide instances of both in our earlier work. In contrast to heparin, a newly discovered fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (FucCS) from the body wall of the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea (PpFucCS) was found to have significantly lower anticoagulant activity but significant antiviral efficacy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The PpFucCS anticoagulant activity can be further reduced by hydrolysis into oligosaccharide fractions.",

It was then eluted using a linear gradient of NaCl in 0.1 M NaOAc at pH 6.0 from 0 M to 3 M with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. 1,9-dimethyl methylene blue (DMB) reagent was used to monitor each fraction. The polysaccharide fractions that were detected using the DMB assay were combined, dialyzed three times against water, and then lyophilized to concentrate for preservation and transportation. The dialyzed sugars were then subjected to purification using a Sephadex G15 (Sigma) column (1 cm × 30 cm) with water as the mobile phase for cleanup. The lyophilization was performed to purify the sugar. To estimate the concentration of the samples in the various assays, dry weight measurements were collected.",

The plate was then incubated at 37 °C along with 5% CO2 for 1 h. At the different time points (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min) after the shift to 37 °C, the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and incubated in 50 mM NH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min to reduce autofluorescence and washed using 2X PBS. Finally, the cells were incubated in Hoechst solution (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, Catalog No. 33342) in PBS (1:3000) for 10 min to stain the nucleus, followed by a PBS wash. The coverslips were retrieved from the wells and were mounted on glass slides with a drop of mounting medium (2.5% DABCO in Fluoromont G) and air dried for two hours before imaging. The images were acquired on an EVOS-FL epifluorescent microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).",

Comparing the mean inhibition at the highest concentration used (50 μg/mL), we show that the efficacy of native PpFucCS along with the unfractionated but hydrolyzed PpFucCS oligosaccharide mixture (HdPpFucCS) and Fr1 was comparable to UFH, but it was significantly lower in the case of Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 (Figure 2B). Additionally, the native PpFucCS had the least half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value amongst all the tests and was comparable to that of UFH (Table 1). Thus, based on the comparison of low MW PpFucCS products, it is evident that HdPpFucCS and Fr1 maintain better antiviral activity than Fr2, Fr3, and Fr4 while displaying only slightly less activity than native PpFucCS and UFH. Earlier, our 1D 1H NMR spectra showed the presence of four fucose units in Fr1–Fr3 that were similar to the native PpFucCS structure: α- Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc2,4S, α-Fuc4S, and α-Fuc0S. This indicates that, although Fr1–Fr3 differ in size, they have similar structures. The Fuc anomeric peaks in fraction 4 showed an upfield 1H shift, which may indicate desulfation. Interestingly, the Fenton chemistry demonstrated a preserved structural integrity of the native PpFucCS in the majority of the oligosaccharides produced (Fr1–Fr3), and only a small percentage of the very low MW (Fr4) showed more chemical modifications. Combining these recently published results with the current results, it is evident that PpFucCS oligosaccharides lose their anti-HCMV activity in a size-dependent manner and that structural features play a crucial role in their anti-viral activity.",

The R18 dye transitions from one monolayer of a fluid-state phospholipid bilayer membrane to another in a potential-dependent manner, somewhat relieving the quenching of its fluorescence. The fluorescence from the HCMV virus particles that have been labeled with high quantities of R18 is highly self-quenched and their fusion with the host cell membrane leads to an increase in fluorescence, which is often visible only after the virus has entered the cell. A significantly higher number of virus particles entered the mock-treated cells compared to the cells treated with native PpFucCS at 60 min post infection (Figure 3A,B).",

GAGs have a variety of biological functions, including cell signaling, proliferation, and wound healing, as a result of their structural diversity, and are ubiquitously found on the surface of cells, where they act as receptors and signals for cellular and pathogenic processes. Viruses or other pathogens utilize this structural diversity of GAGs to selectively bind and enter the cells. The virion attachment caused by GAG binding and eventual entry are usually independent events, with attachment assumed to be mostly nonspecific and charge-dependent but, instead, entry is thought to be driven by highly specific protein–protein interactions. We have recently shown that HS–virus interactions are specific and depend on a defined structural functional relationship. Interactions with HS are a frequent prerequisite for many viral infections. As a result, inhibitors targeting virus–HS interactions have the potential to function as broad-spectrum antivirals that could have a significant influence on global health.",

In this study, we investigated the anti-HMCV activities of two GAGs: (i) heparin, a highly sulfated linear GAG widely exploited as in research, and (ii) PpFucCS, a unique marine branched GAG. From our results, we were able to compare the anti-HCMV activity of PpFucCS and its LWW fractions with the commonly used control heparin.

Moreover, Fr4 has a degraded structure. All the PpFucCS fractions (Fr1–Fr3) show the same 1D 1H NMR spectral profile as the native, therefore indicating they have the same structure.

PpFucCS oligosaccharides were assayed for their potential to inhibit the HCMV (GFP-tagged TowneBAC strain) infection in HFFs (MOI 0.1) by enumerating the cells expressing GFP. (A) Normalized values from the assay were analyzed by nonlinear regression to fit a dose–response curve using the least squares method considering each repeated measure as an individual point. The plotted curve shows the percentage of HCMV inhibition in a (log) concentration-dependent manner. Curves in the plot represent the following: PpFucCS (red), HdPpFucCS (green), Fr1 (navy), Fr2 (purple), Fr3 (blue), Fr4 (brown), and UFH (black). (B) Using the normalized values from the same assay, we calculated the percentage inhibition at the maximum concentration used (Imax) and compared with the UFH at the same concentration (50 µg/mL) by performing one-way ANOVA test with multiple comparisons by comparing the means of each test with control UFH, and corrected using a Dunnett’s post hoc test, showing significant differences among the means. The results are representative of three independent experiments. The standard error of the mean was plotted as error bars.
