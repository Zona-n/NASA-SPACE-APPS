TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is a large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41, a target SNARE, and is required for efficient protein trafficking to the vacuole. Here, we show that a tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin 3-indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting a role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate a role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through trafficking of auxin transport proteins.",

            "text": "The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is a highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar trafficking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with a new Golgi stack, and also contain distinct subdomains for various trafficking routes. The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters, and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays a crucial role in trafficking of biosynthetic traffic to the vacuole. It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane. The position of the TGN at the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment.",

            "text": "High transport fidelity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle trafficking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs). SNAREs can be broadly classified as target SNARES (t-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as Q or R-SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif. The interaction between a v-SNARE on a vesicle and t-SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of a tetrameric trans-SNARE complex. Usually, three Q SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form a t-SNARE complex and an R-SNARE acts as the v-SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers, enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation. Tethering factors thus increase vesicular trafficking efficiency and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes. It was recently proposed that coiled-coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly. Spatiotemporal regulation of trafficking steps in the cell also requires a family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream effectors. Tethers can act as Rab effectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs.",

The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar trafficking. Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct traffic to the plasma membrane, with a role in mediating stress responses. Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1), a large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identified as a SYP41 interactor and was hypothesized to be a tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased trafficking fidelity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics.",

Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin influx transporters and P-glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity. Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels. Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus affect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development.",

Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence. The SYP4 family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin transport, hence we tested whether the SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of growth on 0.25Ã— MS medium. Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its native promoter, termed complemented lines, were similar to WT seedlings (Figures 1A,B). Since the major source of auxin in the root in the first 10 days after germination is transport from the leaves, one possible reason for this defect may be that auxin flux is reduced in tno1, leading to suboptimal auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To confirm that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines (Figure 1C), suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1.",

We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype in tno1 mutants is due to defect(s) in auxin transport, it may be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeable auxin 1-NAA, which has been previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in mutants defective in auxin transport, the natural auxin IAA, and the influx-specific auxin 2,4-D. Following auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not significantly different (P > 0.1) from the bending angles of the WT and complemented lines (Figure 2C), indicating rescue of the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The 2,4-D treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has been previously reported but there were no significant differences between WT and mutant. Similarly, hypocotyl bending was also rescued after a 12-h treatment with either IAA or 1-NAA (Figure 2D), confirming that the gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin-related defects. 2,4-D did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles significantly lower than WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating an effect of 2,4-D on gravitropism in roots but not in hypocotyls.

Stage II LRs are thus defined by a characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response, which results in differential cellular elongation and downward root growth. This asymmetric auxin flux at the LR tip is caused by the specific activity and distribution of auxin transporters. The asymmetric auxin distribution pattern diminishes significantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and begin growing parallel to the primary root.

This occurs via a cascade of signals leading to asymmetric auxin flow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and cortical cells (moving toward the rootâ€“shoot junction). During this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending. Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending (Figure 2) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs (Figure 4), we hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to a decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation zone.",

Confocal images were acquired before gravistimulation and subsequently at 5, 8, and 12 h after gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips (Figures 5Aâ€“D). In the WT background, GFP fluorescence progressed shootward from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward appearance of fluorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5Bâ€“D). The difference in GFP fluorescence intensity on the upper and lower flanks was expressed as a ratio for each genotype at different time points. This ratio was significantly higher for WT roots than for tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting a stronger response in WT than in the mutants (Figure 5E). This in turn implies that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be due to a decrease in auxin transport, or a difference in auxin response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such a defect could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by a similar mechanism, this could also explain the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response asymmetry in tno1.",

Since tno1 mutants show defects in TGN dynamics and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo at the TGN.

BFA body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants.

This polar transport is dependent on the polar localization of auxin transporters to plasma membranes, via trafficking pathways that achieve correct subcellular distribution. Auxin transporters undergo endocytic recycling from the plasma membrane as well as being targeted to new plasma membrane domains via the TGN. This enables a plant to respond to environmental cues and adjust its growth pattern accordingly. For example, during the bending of roots upon gravistimulation, an accumulation of auxin in the epidermal layer of the elongation zone in the lower half of the root is required to facilitate the bending process. This occurs by the relocalization of auxin transporters, AUX1 in the columella and lateral rootcap and AUX1 and PIN2 in the epidermal cells. The resulting readjustment of auxin flow from the columella via the lateral rootcap cell to the epidermal cells in the root elongation zone leads to differential growth. Since tno1 has defects in intracellular trafficking and TGN dynamics, we hypothesize that these may hinder auxin transport pathways due to change(s) in trafficking of auxin transporter(s).",

Pharmacological studies with auxin transport inhibitors and exogenous auxin analogs suggest that altered auxin pathways are likely to be the underlying cause of this defect. The gravitropic bending defect in tno1 roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application of 1-NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin responses. Growth of tno1 roots is hypersensitive to 2,4-D and IAA but not to the eï¬„ux-specific substrate 1-NAA or the eï¬„ux blocker NPA, raising the possibility that the auxin influx pathway might be defective while auxin eï¬„ux is normal. Although blocking auxin influx with 1-NOA does not result in large differences in root elongation between the tno1 mutant and WT, the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the presence of 1-NOA is still higher for the tno1 mutant roots than the WT and complemented lines. This, coupled with the inability of 2,4-D to rescue the gravitropic bending defect of mutant hypocotyls, may suggest altered responses to the influx-specific substrate 2,4-D. Additionally, the delayed progression of DR5rev:GFP expression in epidermal cells of gravistimulated tno1 roots compared to WT roots suggests that auxin flow from the columella to the epidermis (via the lateral rootcap cells) may be reduced in tno1 roots. Based on these results, we hypothesize that altered auxin influx capacity underlies the gravitropic defects in tno1. Given the role of TNO1, this could occur through altered trafficking of auxin influx carrier(s). However, it is also possible that the sensitivity to 2,4-D in the tno1 mutant is due to differences in auxin signaling, feedback or response, since it is known that the auxin sensing mechanism is complex and varies for different kinds of auxins.",
