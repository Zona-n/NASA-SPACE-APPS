In addition, the onset of age-related decreases in bone mineral density can be delayed by regular exercise to enhance bone accrual during skeletal growth and maintenance. Beneficial cardiovascular adaptations to exercise include enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation of blood vessels, decreased blood pressure, and improved blood lipid profiles. Exercise also increases muscle strength, which is strongly correlated with increased bone strength. Importantly, mechanical loads placed on to the skeleton must exceed a biological threshold in order to stimulate bone-modeling activity. However, disuse models employing venous occlusion produce increases in bone mass.",

Further, 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training resulted in an increase in endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) to the femur. The femoral PNA is one of the primary resistance arteries controlling perfusion of the femur and is responsible for ~70% of the blood supply to this long bone. However, whether this training-induced enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation of bone resistance arteries results in greater bone and marrow perfusion during exercise has not been investigated. Therefore, the present study sought to determine whether regional hindlimb bone and marrow blood flow and vascular conductance is elevated during exercise in chronically exercise-trained (ET) rats. Based on the previously observed enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral PNA with exercise training, we hypothesized that the exercise hyperemia in hindlimb bones would be greater in ET rats relative to that in SED animals.",

During the week preceding blood flow experiments, SED animals were exposed to one week of treadmill acclimatization as described above. All animals were allowed 24–48 hrs of recovery from their last bout of treadmill exercise training or acclimatization prior to the blood flow experiments. For measurement of exercising tissue blood flow, the surgically instrumented animals were placed on a rodent treadmill with a belt speed of ~8 m/min and 15° incline. Belt speed was then increased to 15 m/min. The caudal artery catheter was connected to a 1 mL syringe secured to an infusion-withdrawal pump for withdrawal of a reference blood sample at a rate of ~0.25 mL/min. After 5 min of exercise, 2.0–5.0×105 radiolabeled NEN-TRAC™ microspheres (85Sr or 46Sc randomly selected; 15.5 ± 0.1 µm diameter; PerkinElmer) were infused via the carotid artery catheter. MAP was measured immediately before and after infusion of radiolabeled microspheres via a physiological pressure transducer connected to the carotid artery catheter. Exercise was terminated following complete infusion of radiolabeled microspheres. Reference blood sample withdrawal was stopped ~30 s after the infusion and flush of the radiolabeled microspheres. Identical procedures were employed for measurement of tissue blood flow at rest using energetically distinct radiolabeled microspheres while the animal rested quietly on the rodent treadmill following an ~30 min recovery period from the previous exercising microsphere infusion. The blood flow measurement during exercise was performed prior to the blood flow measurement at rest in order to avoid the effects of the pre-exercise anticipatory response.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether exercise training augments regional skeletal blood flow in the hindlimb during exercise activity. We hypothesized that the exercise hyperemia in hindlimb bones would be greater in ET rats relative to that in SED animals. The results demonstrate that in only 1 of 9 bone or bone regions investigated, the femoral diaphysis Fig. 1A), was blood flow higher during exercise in the ET rats compared to that in the SED animals, suggesting chronic exercise training may not have a major impact to elevate bone and marrow blood flow capacity. However, in SED animals, exercise induced an increase in perfusion in only 3 of 9 bone or bone regions tested (i.e., femur diaphysis, tibia diaphysis, tibia diaphyseal marrow), whereas an exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 bone or bone regions (i.e., femur diaphysis, femur diaphyseal marrow, tibia proximal epiphysis and metaphysis, tibia diaphysis, tibia diaphyseal marrow, tibia distal epiphysis and metaphysis, fibula) in ET rats. These data suggest exercise training may not induce a large increase in the blood flow capacity of bone, but rather serves to enhance perfusion of a broader region of bone during physical activity. To our knowledge, these are the first data to demonstrate an augmentation of bone and marrow blood flow during exercise following a period of regular exercise training.",

For example, removal of the endothelium in rat gracilis muscle arterioles completely abrogated ET-induced improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In the rat abdominal aorta and skeletal muscle microcirculation, improvements in endothelium-dependent vasodilation following 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training served to blunt adrenergic vasoconstriction. Exercise has favorable effects on the molecular environment supporting a healthy endothelium as evidenced by improvements in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein expression, increased eNOS Serine 1177 phosphorylation, improved antioxidant enzyme expression (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase), and reduced expression of oxidant generating enzymes such as xanthine oxidase. Furthermore, chronic exercise has been demonstrated to increase angiogenesis, improve skeletal muscle capillarization, and enhance endothelium-dependent vasodilation, all of which are thought to contribute to the greater aerobic exercise capacity associated with exercise training.",

Prolonged treadmill exercise has also been shown in rats to increase femur bone length, improve measures of tibia bone mineral content, and elevate osteoblast biomarkers osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase, with corresponding decreases in the osteoclast biomarker serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

For example, recent work has shown that prolonged skeletal disuse in hindlimb unloaded rats induces a narrowing of the maximal diameter of the femur PNA and rarefaction of the microvascular network, both of which result in a lower femoral bone and marrow perfusion and vascular conductance with reloading. In contrast, 10–12 wks of treadmill exercise training increases the maximal diameter of the femur PNA and enhances the PNA endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Such changes in vascular structure and vasomotor properties may contribute to the increases in vascular conductance (Figs. 1B, 2B & 3B) and broader exercise hyperemia in the bone and marrow of ET rats observed in the present study.",

Such increases in bone blood flow during chronic bouts of exercise in ET rats likely generate increases in endothelial shear stress in the bone vasculature that facilitate the release of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and prostacyclin (PGI2) that each may have important paracrine effects on bone cells. For example, NO inhibits osteoclasts and stimulates osteoblast differentiation. PGE2 increases the number of osteoblasts and decreases the number of osteoclasts in vivo, and PGI2 is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclast mediated bone resorption in culture experiments. Thus, increases in blood flow and vascular shear stress during exercise may facilitate advantageous bone modeling responses that are mediated, in part, by endothelium-derived signaling molecules.",

Indeed, investigators have demonstrated a positive association between endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the femoral PNA with training-induced increases in cancellous bone volume.

However, in SED animals acute exercise increased bone and marrow perfusion in 3 of 9 regions tested, whereas an exercise hyperemia occurred in 7 of 9 bone regions in ET animals. These results indicate that exercise training results in a broader region of elevated blood flow in bone and marrow during physical activity. The observed increases in bone blood flow during exercise may also play an important role in generating osteogenic signals within bone via paracrine effects and/or augmentation of bone interstitial fluid flow to signal bone cells, which contribute to training-induced increases in bone volume. Additional research is required to elucidate a direct role for increased bone blood flow during exercise in augmenting parameters of bone health.",
