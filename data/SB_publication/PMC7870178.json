To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data from NASA’s GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space, to determine transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omic datasets showed significant enrichment for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA’s Twin Study provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.",

We found one overlapping collection of gene sets across all four cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, primary T cells, and hair follicles). Remarkably, this overlap contained multiple mitochondrial function GO terms: mitochondrial ATP synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, oxidative phosphorylation, and hydrogen ion transmembrane transportation (overlapping pathways in Fig. 2A).

We linked mitochondrial stress in the tissues and cells to ribosomal and translational changes (Fig. 2A–2C, S1, and Tables S2 and S6). Specifically, we found ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosolic translation pathways altered, implying proteostasis failure induced by spaceflight. We observed a consistent change in mitochondrial pathways across most tissues we tested, except in the adrenal gland and soleus muscle (Figs. 2B and 2C). The direction of transcriptional changes repeats at the epigenetic level in the internal organs and muscles (Fig. 2D). Lastly, to determine specific mitochondrial activity per tissue from mice flown in space, we analyzed a panel of mitochondrial genes identified from the MitoCarta resource (Fig. 2E).

L-carnitine and malate (Fig. S2B), two examples of metabolites involved in ATP generating processes, showed distinguishable increases in the muscles.

The kidney also showed the induction of the mtDNA-coded subunits (mt-Nd2, mt-Nd4l, mt-ND5, mt-Co2, mt-Co3), and in the oxidative soleus muscle, the nDNA-coded COX genes were also down-regulated. In the EDL, a highly glycolytic tissue, we observed higher levels of mtDNA OXPHOS genes (mt-Co1, mt-Co3, mt-Nd4, mt-Nd4l, mt-Nd5, mt-Atp6), although nDNA-coded mitochondrial genes were not decreased (Fig. 3B).

Activation of the UPRMT can activate the integrated stress response (ISR) (Fig. 3C). For example, oxidative stress activates four kinases (GCN2, PKR, HRI, PERK) that initiate the ISR by regulating the phosphorylation of the cytosolic translation elongation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016). Phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces the cytosolic initiation complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-initiation tRNA), resulting in the preferential translation of mRNAs with an upstream ORF (uORF1) and activates the ISR. ATF5 binds the amino acid receptor elements to upregulate 1-carbon folate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and the stress response factors FGF21 and GDF15. GADD34 dephosphorylates p-eIF2α, allowing protein synthesis to return to normal (Fig. 3C).",

In the RR3 mission, Gadd34 was down-regulated in the oxidative soleus muscle and upregulated in the glycolytic anterior tibialis muscle, while the stress gene Atf5 was upregulated in both the anterior tibialis and in the EDL muscle, which is also a predominantly glycolytic muscle. Finally, we observed the downregulation of the stress response genes Fgf21 or Gdf15 in liver or soleus muscle, respectively. Therefore Atf5, Chop, and Gdf15 are downregulated in oxidative muscle during spaceflight, consistent with reduced ISR. In contrast, the increase in Atf5 and Gadd34 gene expression in glycolytic muscle suggests increased ISR. The modulation of Atf5, Chop, Gadd34, and Gdf15 (Fig. 3C) may indicate that the ISR may be a critical retort to spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of the ISR via mitochondrial dysfunction could be in response to the increased oxidative stress, which would impinge on all of the ISR kinases. Alternatively, the imbalance between the nDNA and mtDNA coded OXPHOS proteins, and UPRMT could also activate ISR.",

These markers are consistent with our analysis suggesting mitochondrial stress and dysfunction due to oxidative stress during spaceflight (Figs. 3B, 3F, and 3G).

The longitudinal decrease in antioxidant capacity observed in astronauts during spaceflight (Fig. 3F) agrees with the development of mitochondrial and metabolic impairment dependent on space exposure. Energy homeostasis is of great importance when considering extended duration space missions, such as the possible mission to Mars, that will last at least 560 days. Our context-specific metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 3G) further demonstrates that spaceflight upregulates NAD metabolism in the liver, linking oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. A time-dependent increase in oxidative stress could have cumulative effects on astronaut physiology, including impacts on cognition and the development of impairing conditions that can make the journey unviable without effective countermeasures.

PGC1α also interacts with PPARγ, and dysregulation of PPARγ has been shown in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) to produce similar results to scarring alopecia (i.e., hair loss disorder). An increase in ROS, as encountered in spaceflight, triggers adult stem cells differentiation, and rapidly switches to mitochondrial OXPHOS.

A recent comprehensive meta-analysis across similar studies found increased risks of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in subjects with sarcopenia. It is also interesting to note that opposite trends in mitochondrial activity in liver and muscle are common in subjects with prediabetes or diabetes type 2. We suggest that muscle loss may relate to the increased metabolic flux changes in spaceflight for the mouse liver versus muscle, an area for future research.",

            "text": "Our data indicate an overall dysregulation in lipid metabolism caused by the space environment, with particular attention to the liver being the body’s central metabolic organ and where LDL is produced. We observed lipid metabolism pathways altered in mice and humans exposed to the space environment (Fig. 6). However, since no lipid pathway changes were observed in cell line data, we suggest lipid metabolism changes are derived from complex interactions at the tissue and organ levels. Two mouse strains were previously found to have accumulated lipids in the liver due to spaceflight exposure. Besides, lipid-related metabolic pathways were increased in the liver of the spaceflight mice (Fig 6C). Increased tryptophan, valine, leucine, isoleucine, TCA cycle, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolites are reported in the development and onset of fibrosis, with valine and bile acid synthesis related to more advanced stages. The lipid/glycolytic metabolic flux imbalance occurring in liver for mice flown to space-related to the onset of fibrosis is directly involved with the mitochondrial process, which involves modulation of oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Also, inflammation leads to changes in lipid metabolism, and the persistence of the inflammatory stimulus can lead to chronic lipid changes associated with metabolic syndrome. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction is both a cause and a consequence of metabolic disorders. Spaceflight induced dyslipidemia in mice and astronauts (Schmidt et al., 2020) can be one contributor to cardiovascular health risks during longer-term space missions.",

The renin-angiotensin system induces hyperpolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane, culminating in cell death. As we found, in the case of renin (Fig. 7E), the hormones in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system were reported as increased in spaceflight. Early in 2020, the first occurrence of venous thrombosis was reported during spaceflight. Limited knowledge exists for the effects of spaceflight on platelets (Vernice et al., 2020). However, mitochondrial dysfunction attenuates platelet survival and increased risk for thrombovascular events, increasing stroke risk. Mitochondrial dysfunction may cause stroke-like episodes independent of hypoxia. Therefore, spaceflight-induced mitochondrial dysfunction could increase cardiovascular disease risk in long-term missions caused by microgravity cardiovascular deconditioning and space radiation.",

Alterations in ribosome assembly, mitochondrial, and cytosol translation pathway in the cell models, internal organs, and muscles (Figs. 2 and 3) suggest the presence of proteostasis failure. Proteostasis refers to the maintenance of the proteome homeostasis by protein synthesis, folding, and degradation. Proteostasis failure occurs in C. elegans in response to spaceflight, although it was not clear if this response was due only to muscle wasting. Alterations in proteostasis were widespread in our cell models and internal organ tissues (Fig. 2). Mitochondrial dysfunction inhibits cytosolic protein synthesis and defective protein quality control. Since mitochondrial function can prevent age-related proteostasis collapse, we suggest countermeasures focused on re-establishing the mitochondrial function will also recuperate the proteostasis condition. Interestingly, proteostasis loss is a hallmark of aged muscles.",

The complement system and pathways related to IFN-γ and IFN-α change in the internal organs (Fig. 4B). Mitochondrial debris were observed in blood in the Twin Study and mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) activate innate immune pathways. We found a similar pattern with IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α up-regulation within muscle tissues and astronaut blood (Figs. 4 and 5B). Interestingly, we also found altered proteasome expression linked to innate immunity (Table S6). IFN-γ can induce a switch to aerobic glycolysis and has a significant role in proteasome regulation, linking mitochondrial dysfunction, innate immunity, and alterations in proteostasis. IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF-α are known to be drivers of muscle wasting in chronic inflammatory diseases. Vitamin D can modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses as the vitamin D receptor is expressed on B cells, T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and dendritic cells. The lower levels of 1,25 Vitamin D and higher IL-1 and IGF-1 levels measured from 59 astronauts are consistent with findings at the cellular and tissue levels (Fig. 5). Adequate energy, protein, and vitamin D supply are essential for bone mineral density maintenance after six months of spaceflight. Astronauts had a decrease in 1,25 vitamin D levels (the active form of vitamin D) (Fig. 5B) consistent with other studies Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) supplementation prevents 1,25 vitamin D loss, leading NASA to increase the vitamin D supplementation to 1000 IU/d. Vitamin D3 is modified through the mitochondria in the liver and kidney to assume its active form, 1,25 vitamin D. Synthetic active vitamin D analogs may not help increase the health risks already associated with spaceflight such as hypercalcemia, kidney stone formation, and ectopic calcification.",

In this study, the mice in space and ground control were maintained in a 12/12 light/dark cycle. They were not subjected to any workload activities that commonly impact astronauts, which rules out both possible causes for this alteration. A return to mitochondrial homeostasis could help restore a healthy awake/sleep cycle in astronauts. The methylated genes demonstrated olfactory activity pathways upregulation in multiple tissues (Fig. 7D). The olfactory bulb pathways are closely linked to circadian rhythm affecting feeding times and immune functions. Additionally, mitochondrial Ca(2+) is a critical element in olfactory signaling and in astronauts, smelling behavior changes occur potentially due to microgravity causing an upward shift of body fluid. Olfactory signaling has even been directly linked to mitochondrial structure and glucose activity, indicating we have uncovered a systemic impact on the body driven by the mitochondria.",

The principal countermeasure applied to astronauts is exercise; astronauts onboard the ISS exercise for up to 2 hours per day, but there is still a considerable decrease in muscle mass, and bone loss observed after landing. Exercise also counteracts the effect of microgravity on the cardiovascular system; nonetheless, neither exercise intensity nor duration showed sufficient to prevent vascular changes as increased arterial and intima-media thickness, cardiac atrophy, and the development of insulin resistance. A study on acute exercise in individuals with a spectrum of insulin resistance showed that acute physical activity triggers molecular responses on the metabolic and energy-producing pathways, increasing glycolysis, TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation. In comparison, our results show an overall decrease in the TCA cycle and fatty acid metabolism in the muscle tissue based on the metabolic flux analysis (Fig. 6D). At the same time, these factors increase in the liver (Fig. 6C), indicating exercise may not be enough to counteract the stressors in space. With exercise currently utilized as an inflight countermeasure, the increases of acute inflammatory markers seen during exercise (e.g., IL-6, TNF-a, IL1-RA, and IGF-1) could be problematic to an already increased inflammatory pattern we measured in astronauts (Fig. 5B), even though these markers are reduced by regular exercise in low-grade systemic inflammation patients.",

Reduced mitochondrial function with sustained calories would generate excess mitochondrial ROS and activate compensatory mtDNA replication, resulting in increased mtDNA transcripts. The combination of replicating mtDNA and ROS would oxidize the mtDNA, which would be released to activate the innate immune system inflammasome and the Type I interferon pathway. The reduced NADH and radiation-induced DNA damage would reduce NAD+ levels (Fig. 3G), which would impair the circadian rhythm system through perturbed Sirt1 regulation of BMAL acetylation. Alteration in mitochondrial protein production would activate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (Fig. 7A), which would trigger the integrated stress response pathway (Fig. 3C), causing phosphorylation of the cytosolic initiation factor eIF2α. This would activate the ATF4 transcription factor to upregulate expression of FGF21 and GDF15 and induce the mitochondrial supercomplex assembly factor SCAF1. Finally, inhibiting the electron transport chain (Fig. 3G) would alter the mitochondrial metabolites, which serve as the substrates for the epigenome modification enzymes.",

Three control groups at Kennedy Space Center consisted of: 1) Basal mice from the same cohorts as FLT mice euthanized at the time of launch, 2) Vivarium (VIV) controls housed in standard vivarium cages, and 3) Ground Controls (GC) housed in RR flight hardware within an environment chamber that controlled temperature, CO2 and humidity to ISS levels. The health and behavior of all mice on the ISS were monitored by video feed on a daily basis. Mice were euthanized by injection of Euthasol, then either fast frozen intact or dissected to preserve livers (fast frozen) and spleens (RNAlater™). Samples were stored at = −80°C until their return to Earth for later analyses.”",

The mice were carried to ISS in a transporter aboard SpaceX Commercial Resupply Mission 8 Dragon cargo spacecraft (SpaceX-8, CRS-8). Dragon docked with the station on April 10, 2016 and by April 12 the animals were transferred aboard the station. Once onboard, they were divided into two groups of ten and housed in habitats for six weeks. Approximately one hour of video per day showing animal health and behavior was recorded in each habitat during the mission. Dissections were conducted over four days at thirty-nine to forty-two days in microgravity. Each dissection day consisted of five animals being dissected. Following euthanasia, blood was extracted via cardiac puncture, separated by centrifugation, and frozen. Right hind limbs were dissected and fixed in four percent paraformaldehyde, and carcasses were frozen. The frozen tissue samples were stored in the minus eighty degree freezer (MELFI). Hardware and tissue samples were returned to Earth for recovery and post-flight analyses. Biospecimens were delivered to CASIS.” Ground controls were conducted on a three-day delay at Kennedy Space Center in ISS environmental simulators (ISSESs) programmed with data from the Dragon capsule and the ISS cabin. Based on post-flight analysis of the RR-2 Habitat telemetry data, the ISSESs were programmed to be two degrees Celsius higher than the ISS cabin data; the result of this off-set was that the internal temperatures of the ground control habitats matched the flight Habitats closely for most of the experiment.”",

Blood was collected using CPT vacutainers (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer’s recommendations. For full details of sample separation, processing see. Briefly, samples collected on ISS were either frozen in −80°C after separation of mononuclear cells by centrifugation (referred to as CPT), or returned to Earth in 4°C in a Soyuz capsule and sorted into CD4, CD8, CD19 populations and a lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction. Samples collected on Earth were either frozen for mononuclear cells or processed when fresh for sorted cell populations. To correct for the effects of ambient temperature exposure on RNA (approximately 36 hours including landing and repatriation) control samples were created by simulating similar conditions to those that may occur during the ambient return and were compared to fresh blood collections from the same individual.

All samples were randomized. The tissues were homogenized, followed by sonication for 10 sec. 10 μl was removed for protein quantification through a micro BCA assay (Thermo Scientific). Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm at 4°C and the supernatant was transferred to a clean siliconized microcentrifuge tube. Chilled 50%:50% acetonitrile:water (300 μl) was added to the pellet and vortexed thoroughly. Following a 15 min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged again and the supernatant combined with the one previously obtained. The samples were vacuum dried and resuspended in 200 μl of 50%:50% methanol:water, without internal standards, and vortexed thoroughly. Samples were further filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and subsequently transferred to a glass mass spectrometry vial. 2 μl of each sample was injected in a BEH C18 column, 130 Å, 1.7 μm at 60°C and analyzed with a Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) system coupled to a time-of-flight Xevo G2S mass spectrometry (MS) instrument, operated in MSE mode. The chromatographic and MS conditions are presented in Table S4. A quality control sample was also generated by pooling together 5 μl from each sample, injected every 10 samples. Initial mass accuracy was determined with a metmix mixture of 6 chemicals that ionize in both modes (acetaminophen, sulfaguanidine, sulfadimethoxine, Val-Tyr-Val, terfenadine, and leucine enkephalin). Mass correction and accuracy was achieved throughout the whole run with intermittent injections of leucine enkephalin as LockSpray™. Positive identification of candidate metabolites was performed through tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with ramping collision energy 10–40 eV with pure chemicals and cross-validation of MS/MS spectra through METLIN or HMDB (spectra shown in Figs. S4–S6). All raw data is available on NASA’s GeneLab platform with identifier: GLDS-343 and DOI: 10.26030/h968-2m75.",

Propionamide of Cys was defined as a fixed modification and Oxidation of Met and Acetylation of protein N-terminal were set as variable modifications. Trypsin/P was selected as the digestion enzyme, and a maximum of 3 labeled amino acids and 2 missed cleavages per peptide were allowed. The False Discovery Rate for peptides and proteins were set at 1%. Fragment ion tolerance was set to 0.5 Da. The MS/MS tolerance was set at 20 ppm. The minimum peptide length was set at 7 amino acids. The rest of the parameters in MaxQuant were kept as default. The generated results by MaxQuant was further processed by PTXQC for quality control analysis. Perseus (1.6.2.2) and in-house R scripts were used for proteomics data processing and statistical analysis. The corrected reporter intensity values generated by MaxQuant were used to analyze the TMT-based proteomics data. Protein groups containing matches to decoy database or contaminants were discarded. Total ion intensity for each reporter ion channel were calculated and matched to correct for the sample loads in each TMT experiment. Only proteins that were quantified in the pooled samples were used for the analysis. Subsequently, internal reference scaling (IRS) method was employed to normalize protein intensities between different TMT runs using common proteins in pooled internal standards. The data was log2 transformed and scaled by subtracting the median for each sample. LIMMA was employed to determine differentially protein abundance between groups and volcano plots were generated using EnhancedVolcano package (Bioconductor) to visualize the affected proteins.

            "text": "For each assay, the overall average level of up and down regulated molecules across all species and strains was computed and use to normalize the individual levels of up and down regulated gene/protein/small molecules (metabolome) by dividing by the average of each assay. Note that regulation here refers to comparing Flight samples versus Ground samples, and thus reflects changes happening in space. For example, Liver data were recorded for both RR1 (C57BL/6) and RR3 (Balb/C) missions for both proteomics and transcriptomics. Thus, the reported value for liver for up-regulation is the average expression measured for liver in both lineages divided by the total average level of gene or protein expression reported here across both strains of mice. Such approach gives an overall view of the various dataset simplifying the identification of tissue systematically up or down regulated for individual assays across all assays, without suffering from absolute regulation levels which vary greatly between assays. Specifically, for the analysis for Figs 1A and B we listed the average number of genes/proteins/metabolome that were up or down regulated across all tissue listed. For example, on average, there were 106 and 37 Proteins up and down regulated respectively, with an overall average of 71. The plotted values are normalized to the overall average (i.e. 71). For example, for gene expression, there is an average of 974 genes regulated (average up: 969, average down: 980). In the case of human fibroblasts, values for either up or down regulated genes were about 5, which implies 5 × 974 genes = 4870 genes for each direction. In contrast, a value of 0.574 and 0.845 for up and down for T cells was found, corresponding to 0.574 × 974 = 560 and 0.845 × 974 = 833 respectively. Such scaling was necessary to show the relative amount of changes between tissue and across all assay, without suffering from very distinct level of expression between assays. In the case of protein, we reported the average number of proteins being detected for all groups. Across all tissues, on average across tissue, we had 2980 proteins and 27109 genes detected. Thus, 969 up regulated genes correspond to 3.6% of all detected genes and 37 down regulated proteins corresponds to 1.3% of all detected proteins.",

Solid bars represent the ground samples (HR) over time and the patterned bars represent the flight samples (TW) over time. Expression in the 100215_CPT_HR ground sample (the second bar for ground samples) was set as 1. Sample details can be found in Table S5. The x-axis displays color-coded bars indicating which samples are pre-flight (black), during flight (yellow), and post-flight (orange). The error bars represent technical replicates. F) Levels of antioxidative capacity, 8OHdG, and PGF2-alpha in astronauts’ blood and urine for 59 crewmembers. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted to test for differences during and after flight compared to preflight, and comparisons among time points were made using a Bonferroni t-test. Multiple comparisons were accounted for, and only those tests with p<0.001 are reported. Full data table available in Table S3. G) Heatmaps show flux values (rows) vs mice (columns) from both RR1 and RR3 experiments for liver and muscle. Flux values are calculated as described in the methods, showing in the leftmost bar those fluxes whose differential testing results between FLT and GC result in p-values<0.05 (black) or suggestive where p-values fall between 0.05 and 0.1 (grey). Heatmap color scales indicate row-wise Z-scores for a particular flux, with Z-score ranges for that map indicated by key. Links to full heatmaps with all fluxes for all pathways in the tested tissues, as well as flux maps for the above can be found at https://osf.io/utmwf/ which also includes data used to generate these figures.",
