While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment.",

In addition, significantly altered expression of many proteins that relate to metabolism and structure in the hippocampus has been observed to occur under simulated microgravity. Space radiation studies have revealed cognitive detriment and changes in morphology in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA) regions following oxygen-particle irradiation. The DG is located in the deep region of the hippocampus and has been shown to play an important role in pattern separation and associative memory.

MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), a manganese porphyrin superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic, also termed BMX-001, is remarkably beneficial in many animal models of oxidative stress injury. One study demonstrated that BuOE can reduce oxidative stress damage to the brain caused by radiation exposure. Our recent study showed that BuOE treatment during spaceflight significantly reduces the immunoreactivity of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-hydroxynonena (4-HNE) in the retina. This suggests that BuOE is effective in alleviating stress responses to spaceflight.

In this study, we took advantage of this technology by using the Nanostring GeoMxÂ® digital spatial profiling (DSP) platform to investigate spaceflight-induced changes in gene expression profiles in mouse CT, FCT, and hippocampal DG and CA regions, both with and without BuOE treatment.

A PCA of global transcription shows that in all brain regions examined except FCT, BuOE during spaceflight brought transcription levels closer to GC animals (Figure 5A and Supplementary File S1: Figure S3A), suggesting a partial attenuation of spaceflight transcriptional alterations by BuOE. Even for FCT, the distance between FLT-BuOE and GC-BuOE was smaller than the distance between FLT-SAL and GC-SAL, again suggesting BuOE results in a reduced transcriptional response due to spaceflight. We obtained BuOE-induced DEGs (FLT-SAL vs. FLT-BuOE) using the same criteria as for the spaceflight-induced DEGs (GC-SAL vs. FLT-SAL). We expected that if BuOE attenuates spaceflight-induced differential expression, then BuOE-induced DEGs should tend to change in the opposite direction as the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Indeed, for all brain regions, significantly more spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as BuOE-induced DEGs (Figure 5BâE). We also performed a permutation test (see Section 4) in which genes were shuffled in order to randomly select up- and down-regulated BuOE-induced DEGs, and checked the overlaps with the spaceflight-induced DEGs. For all brain regions, the number of random overlaps after 1000 permutations was never as large as the number of actual overlaps in the opposite direction (Supplementary File S1: Figure S3BâE).",

            "text": "To obtain insights into the biological processes being affected in the brain by spaceflight, we performed pathway analyses on the spaceflight-induced DEGs. Interestingly, several pathways known to be altered by oxidative stress were significantly enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight: VEGF signaling in CA, calcium signaling in DG, FoxO signaling in FCT, and ECM-receptor interaction in CT. In addition, a number of metabolic pathways were among the most significantly enriched, consistent with numerous studies that have found alterations in metabolism and its regulation due to spaceflight-induced neuroendocrine and psychophysiological changes. For example, a mouse study revealed an accumulation of lipids in the liver after spaceflight. Studies also show that space stressors induce metabolic changes in mouse plasma and in the expression of metabolism-related genes. Longitudinal metabolomic profiles revealed sex-specific perturbations in glucose and amino acid metabolism that result from the stressors of long-duration spaceflight; therefore, follow-up studies on sexually dimorphic transcriptional responses to spaceflight in the brain may be warranted.",

This is consistent with our previous spaceflight genomic study, which showed spaceflight altered some genes associated with circadian rhythm in the mouse retina. Spaceflight missions often expose astronauts to atypical sleepâwake cycles and work schedules. Changes in circadian rhythm may have a significant impact on neurobehavior and neurophysiological processes. Previous studies have found that circadian rhythm disruption or circadian misalignment in astronauts may affect performance and cognitive function. Our results suggest that changes in circadian rhythm induced by spaceflight may involve the DG region. This could help in developing countermeasures for sleep disturbance during spaceflight.",

It has been suggested that in stressful environments, antioxidant expression of SOD and catalase are reduced to conserve energy. BuOE, a recently developed antioxidant compound, is among the most highly potent metalloporphyrins that have been evaluated for safety and efficacy. Many animal studies have demonstrated that BuOE is highly effective in mitigating oxidative stress induced by radiation exposure. We therefore treated a subset of our mice with BuOE in order to test its ability to attenuate spaceflight-induced changes in transcription in the CA, DG, FCT, and CT. Treatment with BuOE reversed spaceflight-induced changes in transcription of a substantial number of DEGs, and a statistically significant number of spaceflight-induced DEGs changed in the opposite direction as did BuOE-induced DEGs, suggesting that BuOE may be effective in attenuating at least some of the effects of spaceflight stress on the brain.",

On the other hand, BuOE treatment actually moved the spaceflight transcriptomic profile further away from grounded control animals in FCT, suggesting that FCT may be the region with the most resistance to superoxide scavengers. The DG and CA had intermediate responses to BuOE relative to the CT and FCT.
