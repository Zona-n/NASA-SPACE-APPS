NSCs displayed both higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis than ground controls. These cells also kept their ability to become young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of space NSC-derived neurons showed immature cell membrane properties characterized by small capacitance and very high input resistance. Current injections elicited only an incipient action potential. No spontaneous synaptic events could be detected, suggesting their immature status even though most recorded cells displayed complex morphology and numerous cell processes. Ascertaining the origin of the NSCs′ increased energy requirement is of the essence in order to design effective measures to minimize health risks associated with long-duration human spaceflight missions.",

            "text": "The long-term effects of the space environment on the central nervous system (CNS) still remain largely unknown. Human space travelers experience a unique environment that affects homeostasis and physiological adaptation. In particular, neuro-psycho-physiological health deserves special attention to ensure successful long-term space missions. In recent years, studies have started to address neural function and behavior in space. It has been reported that cerebellar, sensorimotor, and vestibular brain areas seem to be the most affected. Microgravity reduces central venous and intracranial pressure; nonetheless, intracranial pressure is not reduced to the levels observed in the 90° degrees seated upright posture on Earth. Instead, the basal levels over 24 h in microgravity pressure in the brain are slightly higher than those on Earth, which may cause the remodeling of the eye in astronauts. Moreover, a space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) has been recently described. At the cellular level, it has been shown that microgravity induces apoptosis, alters the cytoskeleton, and affects the differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic status in different cells. Nonetheless, only a few aspects regarding the sensitivity of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) in microgravity have been reported. An interesting article from Silvano and collaborators showed that murine cerebellar neural stem cells (NSCs) respond to simulated microgravity by the arrest of their cell cycle in S-phase and enhanced apoptosis. They also found that these changes were transient and upon return to normal gravity (1 G) these cells recovered their stemness and a normal cell cycle.",

Upon return, the cells were harvested from the hardware and seeded on poly-d-lysine. After the recovery period, the NSCs were seeded in Seahorse Bioscience XFplates (Agilent) to assess their cellular bioenergetic status. Tire oxygen consumption rare (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR, a measure of glycolysis) were both higher in the NSCs exposed to the space environment as compared to the ground control cells, indicating a higher metabolic state (Figure 3). These measurements were performed one week after the NSCs returned to Earth. Therefore, one can infer that NSCs “remember” having been in microgravity. Alternatively, re-adaptation to 1 G may have prompted higher energetic needs.",

These properties are similar to those obtained from implanted NSCs. After measuring passive membrane properties, the recording was switched to the current clamp mode.

Additionally, their cells were kept in simulated microgravity far 3 to 5 days, as opposed to our NSCs, which were exposed to SPC microgravity tor 5 days at 37 °C and in BrdU for 3 days. Therefore, the reasons for the apparent contradiction may be due to the following: (1) the extent of the exposure to microgravity, which might be a determinant for the arrest of cell proliferation in Silvano’s study or (2) perhaps simulated microgravity differs from space microgravity with respect to the regulation of neural cells and their biological processes. Why a higher bioenergetic state is elicited by microgravity is not clear at the present time. The fact that we demonstrated that NSCs proliferate in space needs to be studied in more detail, as it might be that this phenomenon contributes to the visual impairment and intracranial pressure syndrome (VIIP) exhibited by astronauts in space and upon their return to Earth. Elucidating the origin of the increased energy needs by brain cells is crucial in order to design effective countermeasures for astronauts working onboard the International Space Station and for long-term space travel. Moreover, here we found that NSCs displayed an elevated energy metabolism; both oxygen consumption and glycolysis were higher than in the ground control counterparts, confirming our previous findings from work using “simulated microgravity”. We have previously reported that simulated microgravity enhances mitochondrial function in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the CNS. Two of the main sources of energy for respiration and energy production, glucose and pyruvate, were decreased after just 3 days in microgravity, while lactate levels increased considerably indicating that OLs switched to anaerobic glycolysis in order to meet the energy demands elicited by microgravity.",

Nonetheless, the cells appeared to be able to recover from such a journey and display their stemness when returned to Earth. Furthermore, as mentioned above, their membrane properties were similar to the NSCs grown in normal gravity.",
