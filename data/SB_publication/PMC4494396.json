            "text": "Earthquakes occur when tectonic stresses build up deep in the Earth before catastrophic rupture. During the build-up of stress, processes that occur in the crustal rocks lead to the activation of highly mobile electronic charge carriers. These charge carriers are able to flow out of the stressed rock volume into surrounding rocks. Such outflow constitutes an electric current, which generates electromagnetic (EM) signals. If the outflow occurs in bursts, it will lead to short EM pulses. If the outflow is continuous, the currents may fluctuate, generating EM emissions over a wide frequency range. Only ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) waves travel through rock and can reach the Earth surface. The outflowing charge carriers are (i) positively charged and (ii) highly oxidizing. When they arrive at the Earth surface from below, they build up microscopic electric fields, strong enough to field-ionize air molecules. As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.",

When rocks reach a critical limit, catastrophic failure occurs, causing a rupture to propagate, sometimes over distances of hundreds of kilometers, with typical speeds in the range of 2.2–3 km/s—supersonic with respect to the speed of sound in air. The rupture generates shockwaves in the Earth that spread at speeds of about 6 km/s for the compressional (P) waves and about 3.4 km/s for the more destructive shear (S) waves. An earthquake of magnitude 7 releases an energy equivalent to that of more than 2000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs. The magnitude scale being exponential, the energy released by a magnitude 9 earthquake is equivalent to more than 2,000,000 A-bombs. ",

Unfortunately, even if the database for past events is very large, counting thousands, even tens of thousands, the prediction of any single future earthquake is subject to the large uncertainty, which is an inescapable corollary of statistics of small numbers. For this reason seismological prediction models are typically given with uncertainty windows on the order of decades, even centuries. Only in very few cases have predictions been attempted with quoted uncertainty windows of only a few years. Seismologists are of course aware of these statistical limitations. This is why their majority believes that earthquakes are inherently unpredictable. ",

In unconstrained rock cylinders such volume increase is due to internal cracks opening as a result of the applied stress. However, deep in the Earth crust, under the isostatic load of tens of kilometers of rock, the opening of cracks or microfractures is unlikely because the attendant volume increase has to perform work against a very large overload.",

Such fluid flow leads to separation of charges because cations tend to be retained on the walls of pores and narrow channels, while anions are carried along with the flow. This is the electrokinetic effect. The resulting potential, the “streaming potential”, produces voltage signals, which have been invoked to explain geoelectric and electromagnetic signals recorded prior to major earthquakes.

Changes in pre-EQ radon emanation have long been reported. Each alpha particle emitted during radon decay creates about 105 electron-ion pairs along its path, forming a narrow plasma channel, about 1 cm long in air. A small fraction of these electron-ion pairs escape recombination and, hence, lead to an increase in air conductivity. This air conductivity increase has been claimed to be responsible for a number of pre-EQ phenomena including animal behavior.

For example, one of the most astonishing effects of extremely low amplitude EM oscillating field, even when the magnetic flux of such field is below the thermal noise (i.e., nanoTesla field), is to change the electron precession, or spin, in universally conserved biochemical reactions that coordinate genome expression to maintain circadian timing. The cryptochrome proteins, which maintain the circadian rhythm, also show high sequence similarity to universally conserved proteins that maintain genome integrity by repair of oxidation-damaged DNA. Such weak EM fields tuned in frequency to the rate of electron spin (i.e., MHz) have been shown to cause aberrant growth of cells and disorientation with respect to the magnetic and gravity vectors in various organisms, including plants and animals.

Magnetic perception can also account for the behavior of cows and wild deer that tend to align their bodies north-south direction while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high voltage power lines that generate ELF electromagnetic fields, which disrupt the magnetic alignment of ruminants. Although the geomagnetic field is weak and is generally thought to be masked by thermal fluctuations and other noise, the proposed bio-physical mechanism for magneto perception is based on coherent quantum effects of extremely weak magnetic fields on the electron spin in each of radical pair intermediates of molecules in redox reactions.

This astonishing physical phenomenon allows the systems to exceed—through athermal mechanisms—the limit on EM radiation with intensity less than 10 mW/cm2 thought to be unlikely to significantly affect physiology. In addition, it is important to note that pausing the rotation of ATP synthase, or changing the direction of its rotation, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to the depletion of ATP, respectively.

This is enough to accelerate electrons in the air, which are always present due to cosmic ray and other ionization events, to such high values that they begin to impact-ionize neutral air molecules, triggering tiny corona discharges. Importantly these corona discharges produce avalanches of electrons and positive ions in the air. The free electrons will attach themselves rapidly to neutral air molecules such as N2, forming negative airborne ions such as N2–. In addition the corona discharges produce tiny light flashes with a broad emission spectrum over the VIS and UV regions. The UV component of these flashes can be expected to produce ozone, O3, and other reactive gases such as nitrous oxides, to which animals may respond. ",

The CO profile is broken down into 7 altitude windows as indicated in the insert, from 0 up to 110 m, up to about 1,500 m, up to about 3000 m, and higher. The data show that the regional background CO concentration was always highest close to the ground, i.e., in the lowest altitude window, with values between 100 and 150 ppb. However, starting probably more than a week before the magnitude 7.6 seismic event, the CO concentration increased, reaching a maximum on January 19, 2001 around 240 ppbv in the air below 110 m. The total amount of CO in the air column would be enough to reach 500 ppm near the surface, a potentially lethal concentration because CO induces phase advancement into the oxidative respiratory phase of the metabolic cycle in all aerobic organisms. Indeed, CO acts in a manner similar to cyanide by binding to the heme in cytochrome c oxidase and inhibits electron transport and ATP production, which leads to an increased ROS production. This fundamental and universal mechanism of CO-induced ROS production during the redox cycle applies to all aerobic cells. Therefore, a pre-EQ influx of h• charge carriers into the soil layer can cause gaseous CO release, which functions as a cellular signaling molecule that attenuates metabolic cycling toward stress (i.e., oxidative damage in living cells).",

In some cases, purported precursory behaviors have been discounted by systematic studies . Animals, including humans, do respond to signals that they can feel, such as small earthquakes that might be foreshocks . Anecdotal evidence suggests that some animal species may have evolved “early warning” systems that allow individuals to respond in the few seconds prior to the onset of strong shaking, most probably triggered by the weak shaking of the first-arriving P wave . Geobiologists have also speculated on the evolution of sensory systems that could detect more subtle precursory signals . However, there is no credible scientific evidence that animals display behaviors indicative of earthquake-related environmental disturbances that are unobservable by the physical and chemical sensor systems available to earthquake scientists.”",

This prevailing attitude makes it difficult, if not impossible, to recognize the complexity of the interactions between animals and the physical world. The real problem is not the absence of observationally well-documented facts about unusual animal behavior but a lack of understanding how the reported non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena are generated in the natural environments, and what are the non-seismic stimuli to which animals appear to respond.

The ULF and ELF waves have the capacity to interact with living organisms and to interfere with fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular level. When the charge carriers arrive at the ground-to-air interface, they are able to ionize the air producing—under certain conditions—exclusively positive airborne ions. Such positive airborne ions are known to have pronounced and generally detrimental physiological effects.
