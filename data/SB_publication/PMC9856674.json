Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and observe the maintained transcriptomic response after returning to ground conditions for four, eight, and twelve days. We show that 75% of the simulated microgravity-induced changes on gene expression persist after returning to ground conditions for four days while most of these changes are reverted after twelve days. Our results from integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity affects longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Finally, we identified 118 genes that are commonly differentially expressed in simulated microgravity- and space-exposed worms. Overall, this work provides insight into the effect of microgravity on biological systems during and after exposure.",

Simulation of microgravity is a cost-effective way to study the impact of microgravity on biological systems. For this purpose, various platforms including drop towers, parabolic flights and space flights are available. Because of their advantages to enable long term simulations in an effective and economical manner, clinostats are widely preferred to study gravitational response in biological systems, mainly plants, for decades. Clinostats rotate a sample around a horizontal axis, thereby exposing the sample to a rotating gravitational vector. This can reduce and even possibly remove gravitational bias in the development of an organism.",

The usage of this organism in previous space missions (such as International C. elegans Experiment in Space (ICE-First), C. elegans RNAi space experiment (CERISE), Shenzhou-8, and Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus Science Insert-01 (CSI-01)) have provided valuable insights into the biological response of C. elegans to space conditions. However, these studies generally have utilized different strains and liquid cultures instead of commonly used OP50-seeded agar plates to reduce the impact of surface tension. We previously have shown that the usage of different liquid cultures and strains cause highly distinct intergenerational transcriptomic and phenotypical responses. Similarly, a recent study reported dramatical intergenerational changes in the physiology of liquid-grown worms. Thus, complementary to the spaceflight studies, separate investigations can provide insight into the impact of individual space conditions on biological processes.",

Approximately 100,000 live worms (P0 generation) were cleaned by sucrose floatation, their embryos (F1 generation) were harvested by bleaching and placed in ~40 mL of CeHR medium in sterile VueLife culture bags (“AC” Series 32-C, Saint-Gobain, La Défense Cedex, France). Four culture bags were mounted in a lab-built clinostat inside a laminar flow biosafety hood, and one was kept aside as a ground control. The clinostat rotated the culture bags at 1 rad/s (~10 RPM) for four days, which is the measured time to reach L4/adulthood at 21 °C in CeHR medium. Worms from one bag were immediately harvested to represent simulated microgravity conditions. The remaining three culture bags were processed in four-day intervals to represent the return to ground conditions. We note that F2 generation and beyond will not maintain synchronicity, and all will contain a mixture of generations, but recovering only the live animals enriches the RNA pool for the expected (majority) generation as each adult will produce ~30 offspring in CeHR culture. The experimental scheme is limited to using mixed stage worms because of the technical difficulties associated with manually picking the desired age (swimming) worms from liquid cultures. Live worms were selected for harvesting by sucrose floatation and total RNA was isolated with TRIzol treatment and recovered by alcohol precipitation. Total RNA was further purified by PureLink ™ RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Two micrograms of total RNA were used for library preparations using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina).

Previously, Higashibata et al. (2006) reported decreased expression for the myogenic transcription factors and myosin heavy chains in space-flown worms. We did not observe differential expression for these muscle-related genes. Since their reported flight to ground gene expression ratio for the downregulated genes was less than one, and we only consider the genes with the log2 ratio greater than two as DEG, we did not expect to observe those genes in our group of DEGs. To test whether other muscle-related genes are differentially expressed under simulated microgravity, we compared our DEGs to 287 genes reported in WormBase for involvement in muscle system morphology variant or any of its transitive descendant terms via RNAi or variation. Only T14A8.2, col-103, and sqt-3 among the 287 genes showed downregulation under simulated microgravity (hypergeometric test, p-value = 0.99).

To identify whether a similar pattern occurs under simulated microgravity, we determined the expressed ncRNA molecules in ground control, simulated microgravity, and return. Since the housekeeping gene pmp-3 presents consistent expression patterns both in our study and previous studies, we considered its minimum expression level (FPKM = 24.7) in our experiment as the cutoff for the expression of ncRNA molecules. The number of expressed ncRNA molecules slightly decreased in response to simulated microgravity (Supplementary Figure S2A). Interestingly, this number increased on the eighth day of return. We found that the expression of 126 ncRNA molecules is induced during simulated microgravity exposure and for 12 days after the return (Supplementary Figure S2B) while the expression of 16 ncRNA molecules is lost during and after simulated microgravity (Supplementary Figure S2C). Among the classified ncRNA molecules, mostly small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lincRNA) molecules were induced while other sets of snoRNA and antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules lost expression in simulated microgravity. For instance, asRNA molecules anr-33, K12G11.14, and ZK822.8 are induced whereas anr-2, anr-9, and Y49A3A.6 are silenced during and 12 days after the exposure.",

Our results have revealed that 20 TF genes are upregulated during the exposure and 90%, 75%, and 15% of these genes maintained their upregulation after the return for four, eight, and twelve days, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3). These TFs play a role in a variety of mechanisms such as double strain break repair or sex determination.

The best human BLASTP-match of tbx-43 in WormBase, TBR, functions in developmental processes and is required for normal brain development (E-value = 3 × 10−33; identity = 68.5%).

For instance, Honda et al., found that age-dependent increase in 35-glutamine repeat aggregation is suppressed and seven longevity-controlling genes are differentially expressed in spaceflight. To examine whether simulated microgravity induces such changes, we mapped the DEGs (simulated microgravity versus ground control) to longevity regulating pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). We used a less stringent criterion for differential expression by including the genes with log2(FPKM) > 1.5 in this analysis. We determined 11 DEGs in the longevity regulating pathway genes most of which are involved in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (insulin/IGF-1) (Figure 3). Interestingly, the transcription factor DAF-16 gene did not exhibit differential expression unlike its targets sod-3, lips-17, and ctl-1. Because the translocation of DAF-16 into the nucleus activates or represses target genes functioning in longevity, metabolism, and stress response, this finding was unexpected. The nuclear localization of DAF-16 is antagonized by transcription factor PQM-1, and thus an upregulation in pqm-1 may indicate inhibition of DAF-16 translocation. Our data, however, did not present a differential expression for pqm-1 and thus it does not suggest inhibition of the DAF-16 translocation. It is possible that the DAF-16 targets are differentially expressed due to the translocation state of DAF-16 or involvement of other factors (e.g., other transcriptional regulators).",

In line with this, our results showed that the sphingolipid signaling pathway is downregulated under simulated microgravity. That is, putative glucosylceramidase 4 gene (gba-4) and putative sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase asm-3 are downregulated and these downregulation patterns were sustained for eight days after return to ground conditions (Figure 4a). This downregulation pattern indicates an attenuation in the ceramide levels through a potential decrease in the degradation of sphingomyelin and glucosylceramide to ceramide. Along with the other biological functions such as autophagy, senescence, and apoptosis, the sphingolipid signaling pathway has critical functions in aging and longevity regulation. The inhibition of this conserved pathway results in an extension of lifespan in animals from worms to humans. For example, the inactivation of asm-3 in C. elegans causes translocation of DAF-16 into the nucleus, promotion of DAF-16 target gene expression, and extension of lifespan by 14–19%.",

Increase in the LacCer and HexCer levels have been determined as biomarkers of aging in humans and murine while LacCer C18:1 was unaffected during aging in C. elegans. It is unclear why LacCer levels are elevated when the HexCer levels are decreased, but the overall pattern indicates a downregulation in the sphingolipid signaling pathway under simulated microgravity.",

To test this hypothesis, we examined the enrichment for PPI of these genes by using the STRING database.
