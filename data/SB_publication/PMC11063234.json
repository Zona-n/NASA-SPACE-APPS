For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted p-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR5-ion irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis.",

These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. noted an increase in a 75 kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250 MeV) and 16O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15 Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 weeks out to 1 year after a single exposure. Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function.",

As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR5-ion. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR5-ion and suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart.",

Each data set was analyzed using a bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach, as outlined in the Materials and Methods, to map these changes to cellular location, protein function, and biological pathways. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways affected at 0.1 FDR cutoff. See Supplementary Table S4–S8 for details on all pathways emerging from the bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach. For the heart proteome, the major upregulated enriched pathways were: inflammatory processes (including coagulation cascade, complement cascade), elastic fibers, amino acid metabolism, citric acid cycle, extracellular matrix interactions, integrins, cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, urea cycle, HNF-3B/FOXA2 pathway, and metabolism of fat-soluble vitamins (Figure 4A). Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the heart proteome were: cell cycle/transcription (CCTR), HIV life cycle, iron uptake and transport, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, insulin glucose pathways, mitochondrial functions (including oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system), and keratinization/cornification (Figure 4C). The CCTR pathway contained the most proteins and Supplementary Figure S1 shows the complete pathway interaction maps for CCTR. Each of the 72 circles represents a pathway in the interaction map with the size of the circle proportional to the number of proteins annotated with each pathway. Two interacting pathways are connected by a line with the thickness of the line proportional to the number of proteins shared between interacting pathways.",

            "text": "Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models. This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1 year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis. From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see Supplementary Figure S4). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models. A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination. Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut’s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent.",
