While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time- and material-dependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.",

For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form, and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal.",

            "text": "One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell–surface and cell–cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material.",

            "text": "Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on “piping and equipment behind the panels”. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which “holes” on the insulation tape were observed. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenum now called Penicillium rubens) started growing on windows’ rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were “zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates” on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over “cold” material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as “white powder”, sometimes “the size of a football”. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS), Penicillium has been the most isolated genus of fungi. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity.",

            "text": "The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell–cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells, and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin, resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention and translate into high mortality rates. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections,, particularly among the immunocompromised, posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure. Particularly, Penicillium rubens has been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals.",

            "text": "While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth–Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space, little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics of P. rubens biofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraft- and nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development.",

Although the temperature was kept close to 25 °C during the incubation time across samples, and despite our efforts to provide a stable environment, the humidity presented significant variations. Specifically, the samples incubated for 10 and 20 days on Earth had RH of approximately half that of the rest of the conditions. Since each PHAB contained samples of all material coupons, this does not affect the comparisons across materials, but it could interfere with comparisons across incubation times and between gravitational regimes.

Three cases of significantly increased biofilm growth in microgravity were observed: Carbon Fiber at day 15 (surface area increase), Stainless Steel at day 15 (surface area increase), and Titanium Alloy at day 10 and day 20 (thickness increase). However, there were two cases that showed the contrary with significantly decreased biofilm growth in microgravity compared to Earth: Carbon Fiber at day 10 (surface area decrease) and Quartz at day 20 (thickness decrease). These two cases, where fungal biofilms on Earth grew better than in space, are of particular interest because those samples correspond to the conditions (Earth at 10 days and 20 days) that experienced fluctuations of humidity (Figure 5). The ideal RH for P. chrysogenum is 90%, and decreases in fungal growth below this RH have been observed. Previous studies have shown that drops in humidity can immediately stop growth and cause the dehydration of P. rubens. On occasion, the fungus is able to start growing again when the humidity increases, but other times, RH fluctuations (of as little as 3 h) can suppress growth permanently, so only new germination can occur. Additionally, there is evidence that after being exposed to high humidity, P. rubens cannot restart growth following a desiccation event of RH below 75%. Since the humidity fluctuations in Earth PHABs of 10 and 20 days lasted for days and the PHABs reached RH of 50% and below, we expected the fungal growth to be impaired for those samples. Hence, it is possible that if RH values would have been equivalent between flight and ground in the day 10 and 20 PHABs, even more biofilm growth could have been observed on Earth. Nevertheless, this would not change our relative observation presented here—likely except for Titanium Alloy at 20 days, results that may be an artifact of the RH challenges. Quartz at 20 days was an exception to this trend as an increase in biofilm formation was seen despite lower RH values. While we have no clear explanation as to why this occurred, a previous study classified P. chrysogenum (the previous species name for P. rubens) as xerotolerant, meaning it can undergo a complete life cycle at low RH values and is considered resistant to dry environments. While this was not studied specifically in this investigation, how P. rubens survives in dry environments should be further examined.",

It is important to note the significant outlier in the Carbon Fiber 10-day sample grown on Earth and the effect of removing this outlier from the statistical test. When removed, the comparison between Earth and space sample groups is no longer significant; however, all of the other observed differences remain the same, which implies mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth. Despite the changes in biofilm growth in microgravity, no consistent visual trends in morphological shape (overall 3D structure) across gravity conditions were observed. Therefore, in our experiment, microgravity did not impact the fungal shape of the biofilm. The mechanisms behind the changes in fungal biofilm formation in microgravity are still unclear and need further investigation. One potential mechanism behind the changes observed in this investigation could lie in how different fungi sense gravity. The octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN) is the structural protein comprising the vacuolar protein crystals that the fungal family Mucorales uses to sense gravity. While this protein does not exist in Penicillium species, other unknown gravity sensing proteins could be present. Research into how other fungal families, such as Penicillium, might be capable of sensing gravity is a crucial next step to understanding fungal biofilm growth in microgravity and the changes in biofilm formation observed in this study.",

            "text": "The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time (Appendix A), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores’ hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer in Aspergillus fumigatus, and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found in P. rubens (Accession No. AM920436.1) using NCBI’s BLAST Tool, meaning that P. rubens could also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow the P. ruben spores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss.",

Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume. Furthermore, Candida albicans, another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts.",

Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell–cell adhesion and cell–surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cell–surface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining.
