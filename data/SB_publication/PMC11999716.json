Studies have shown that microorganisms, especially extremophiles, respond to the challenge of anthropogenic contaminants through adaptive degradation and biosorption (Xu et al., Ghosh and Das, McCutcheon et al., Sharma et al.). One such example includes the rapid shifts in marine microbial population observed after the DeepWater Horizon Spill both in open ocean (Mason et al., Redmond and Valentine, Kimes et al.) and coastal wetlands (King et al.), where the relative abundance of petrochemical-degrading species increased significantly after the spill. In addition to natural adaptation of endogenous species, microbial remediation can occur by introducing target species to an environment. For example, introduction of a consortium consisting of probiotic bacteria efficient in degrading naturally occurring petroleum hydrocarbons to coral environments was shown to be effective in remediating oil spills without negatively impacting the coral holobiont, unlike using chemical dispersants (Fragoso ados Santos et al.). A two-stage fungal remediation study to tackle textile industry dye effluent utilizing both adsorption and accumulation illustrated the potential of integrated approaches in bioremediation (Mathur et al.). Microbial bioremediation, while presenting constraints of efficacy and scale, can be considered preferable over physico-chemical remediation as it does not leave further residues (Das and Dash).",

            "text": "Superfund sites, with their high concentrations of toxic compounds, can be considered an extreme environment and extremophiles are known for their potential for bioremediation (Kaushik et al.). While every Superfund site is unique in its composition of contaminants, a growing body of literature has shown that microbial bioremediation often develops spontaneously. While microbial diversity can be decreased at a toxic site, the abundance of bioremediation-related species increases (Lowe et al.) with specific functions such as the microbial dechlorination of compounds, including PCBs (Rodenburg et al.). Microbial bioremediation is a long standing practice (Antizar-Ladislao), and more recently sequencing technologies and metagenomic analyses have enabled the identification of genes and species responsible for observed remediation-related metabolisms (Dangi et al., Gupta et al.). These observations, in addition to the accelerated evolution of microbial communities in extreme environments (Li et al.), make Superfund sites candidates for metabolism miningâboth with respect to contaminant-related functions, such as metal rare earth element binding, and also for discovery of novel functions or metabolites of potential biotechnological interest. Indeed, microorganisms in the environment can produce a wealth of secondary metabolites (SMs) which have been historically used for various biotechnological applications, including production of antibiotics, anticancer agents, and agrochemicals (Katz and Baltz). SMs synthesized through the expression of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) can be hard to identify using bioactivity screens as BGCs are often silent, only activated under pleiotropic environmental triggers such as growth condition variation or introduction of competing species (Rutledge and Challis). Genome mining using high-throughput sequencing approaches has been used to identify BGCs responsible for encoding these SMs without the need for identifying the appropriate activation triggers (Udwary et al.). In particular, environmental microbiomes, even urban ones, can be a rich substrate for the discovery of such molecules (Charlop-Powers et al.). Given the Gowanus Canalâs uniqueâand extremeâenvironment, we hypothesize that its microbiome might be a source of novel BGCs.",

Beta-diversity was calculated by BrayâCurtis dissimilarity index and scaled using NDMS (Fig.Â 2b). The NDMS plot of the taxonomic profiles showed slight separation between the two groups of Sediment sample sets; however, these differences were minor. The samples in the Core set are different from the samples in the Sediment set according to this metric, also previously observed in the UMAP plot (Fig.Â 2a).",

Accordingly, many species found in the Gowanus Canal were previously identified in either marine or freshwater sediment, water or soil. (See Methods for microbial characterization strategies.) Marine sediment species identified include Modestobacter marinus [also radiation-tolerant (Normand et al.)], Labilibaculum filiforme, Draconibacterium orientale (Du et al.), Maribacter arcticus, Sedimentitalea nanhaiensis, Halioglobus lutimaris, Shimia aestuarii, and Thiobacillus denitrificans; and Planktomarina temperata from sea water.

Psychrophiles (cryophiles) are organisms capable of surviving in low temperatures especially in deep sea beds and sediments. We identified psychrophiles such as Cryobacterium arcticum (Bajerski et al.), Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Hyphomonas jannaschiana (also a barophile), Labilibaculum filiforme, Ma. arcticus, and Thiobacillus denitrificans. The EPA and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has classified Gowanus as Class SD type saline environment (GEI Consultants). Consistent with this, we observed halophiles, defined as organisms tolerant to hyper saline environments, including Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Mi. aloeverae (also an alkaliphile), Se. nanhaiensis, and Vibrio diazotrophicus. We also observed a few thermophiles which are organisms adapted for survival in higher temperatures such as Lachnospira pectinoschiza and Thermoleophilum album. On a species level, some of the extremotolerant organisms identified are known for their bioremediation properties. Microbacterium laevaniformans, which has been identified across multiple samples, has previously been isolated from areas contaminated with heavy metals (Brown et al.).",

While some AMR alleles come from human gut species, some environmental species identified in this dataset are also known to harbor resistance genes. These include species previously isolated from water and sediment such as the sulfate-reducing Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus and Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, as well as Thermoleophilum album, Se. nanhaiensis, My. gilvum, and My. fallax. Other species potentially harboring AMR have been previously isolated from soil (My. chubuense and My. obuense), and plants (Mi. aloeverae). Of note, the material sampled in this study was sediment and this substrate contained both human gut related microbes as well as human related AMRs. This means that to a certain extent, human gut microbes from untreated waste streams are persisting in the sediment. Further research could address the fate of waste stream related microbes in the environment, their interactions with chemical contaminants, and the potential of CSOs to develop environmental AMR reservoirs. Recently literature has accumulated that points to contaminantsâ effect on ARG persistence in the environment (Fletcher), including historical industrial contaminants as well as emerging organic contaminants (Alderton et al.). One such mechanism for this impact is that the prevalence of ARGs carried by live bacteria is impacted by the selection pressures their hosts are subject to (Mathur et al.).",

We assessed the potential for this microbiome to be a reservoir of remediation-related functions through functional analysis, identifying gene coding potential and metabolic pathways encoded in this dataset. We identified bioremediation pathways related to degradation of VOCs and complex hydrocarbons, consistent with the historical industries of coal extraction and paint making at the site (Miller). Interestingly, our data suggests that a given microbial species usually uses multiple mechanisms for degradation of a particular aromatic compound, and targets just one group of hydrocarbons. For example, Pseudomonas fluorescens encodes degradation of catechol through three pathways, including meta-cleavage and through the intermediate 2-oxoent-4-enoate. We also identified gene interactions related to heavy metals. In the case of metal related functions, a given species may encode molecular functionality related to multiple metals. Top species are Desulfobacterium autotrophicum, Methanobacterium lacus, Desulfococcus oleovorans, Ruminococcus torques, Desulfobacter hydrogenophilus, Methanosarcina_sp_MTP4, each encoding more than 20 metal related genes. While heavy metals are essential cofactors in many cellular processes, high heavy metal concentrations are also a stressor and microbes adapt by developing resistance mechanisms, including chelation and efflux (Anastassopoulou and Theophanides, Lemire et al., Oves and Khan, Panda et al.). As such, these resistance mechanisms can be applied to biotech applications such as remediation through biosorption and bioaccumulation (Chojnacka). Additionally, there is an interesting potential for using microbial mechanisms to recover rare earth metals from contaminated environments, as these metals are both contaminant and valuable resource (Jyothi et al.). These studies encourage further research to gain insight on the biochemical potential of Superfund sites from the perspective of remediation and resource recovery.",

These efforts are concentrating on soils as environments with potential for pharmacologically relevant molecules (Charlop-Powers et al., Negri et al., Waschulin et al.) and on human body environments with potential to relate to disease phenotypes (Donia et al., Aleti et al.). Here, we show that the Gowanus Canal depicts its own microenvironment encoding novel BGCs. This distribution of BGC families mirrors that reported by Nayfach et al. for the âbioremediationâ category, as compared with other sources including aquatic, wastewater or terrestrial environments. The BGC family distribution observed in the Gowanus, however, differs from that reported in another Superfund site in Vermont, the Ely Copper Mines (Giddings et al.). Indeed, the top two classes of the BGCs in Ely Copper Mines included NRPS and Terpenes. Of note, water and sediment can often have separate BGC profiles such as those described by Nayfach et al., and those from Lake Hillier, a hypersaline environment with distinctive pink color (Sierra et al.). This signifies that irrespective of similarities between multiple extreme environments, the BGC characterization of each environment is unique.",

Indeed, these microbes harbor bioremediation functions, degrading complex hydrocarbons as well as fixing heavy metals while also surviving in extreme conditions as a complex community. These functions can be seen as a resource, and further studied for potential biotechnological and engineering applications. One can imagine at least two avenues for augmenting the bioremediation potential of this resident microbiome. On one hand, one can isolate and characterize specific strains with functions of interest and culture them in bioreactors (Navina et al.), perhaps engineering them to overexpress these genes for accelerated degradation (Dangi et al.). This can be implemented in treating isolated waste, but poses challenges when scaling up and/or releasing genetically engineered strains into the environment (Navina et al.). On the other hand, one can consider altering the environment in which these consortia have evolved, to help overcome limiting steps or apply principles of directed evolution. This has been successfully implemented in the context of microbial treatment of wastewater (Saravanan et al.), and biochar has been shown to effectively augment bioremediation performance due to its properties in altering microbial habitats on a micro scale (Saravanan et al.). Moving forward with either of these options requires considering the ethics of interventions on non-human organisms, because even though we canât relate to microbes in the way we can to beasts of burden, âharnessingâ them still implies making resources through labor (Krzywoszynska).",
