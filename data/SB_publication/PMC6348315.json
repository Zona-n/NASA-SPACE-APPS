            "text": "A feature of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) is the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated gene expression. The patterns of ROS-associated gene expression vary among Arabidopsis ecotypes, and the role of ROS signalling in spaceflight acclimation is unknown. What could differences in ROS gene regulation between ecotypes on orbit reveal about physiological adaptation to novel environments? Analyses of ecotype-dependent responses to spaceflight resulted in the elucidation of a previously uncharacterized gene (OMG1) as being ROS-associated. The OMG1 5′ flanking region is an active promoter in cells where ROS activity is commonly observed, such as in pollen tubes, root hairs, and in other tissues upon wounding. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that upon wounding on Earth, OMG1 is an apparent transcriptional regulator of MYB77 and GRX480, which are associated with the ROS pathway. Fluorescence-based ROS assays show that OMG1 affects ROS production. Phylogenetic analysis of OMG1 and closely related homologs suggests that OMG1 is a distant, unrecognized member of the CONSTANS-Like protein family, a member that arose via gene duplication early in the angiosperm lineage and subsequently lost its first DNA-binding B-box1 domain. These data illustrate that members of the rapidly evolving COL protein family play a role in regulating ROS pathway functions, and their differential regulation on orbit suggests a role for ROS signalling in spaceflight physiological adaptation.",

Exposing plants to novel environments presents opportunities to understand how plants adjust to conditions outside their evolutionary experience. Spaceflight is one such novel environment, and understanding how plants function outside of Earth’s boundaries is also integral to space exploration. Plants respond to spaceflight in ways that are dependent on species, ecotype, genetics and even organs. Indeed, even a single gene difference can influence the spaceflight response, thus investigating ecotype-dependent spaceflight transcriptomes can reveal strategies for physiological adaptation to spaceflight while expanding understanding of gene function in terrestrial environments.",

Two distinct biochemical assays typically used to measure ROS activity indicated that knocking out OMG1 alters the production of ROS. Co-expression networks around OMG1 show correlations to genes involved in ROS-associated oxidative phosphorylation pathways. OMG1 was also expressed in organs known to highly utilize ROS during development, such as root hairs and pollen tubes.

A general positive correlation of ROS-producing genes was observed in all the spaceflight transcriptomes and hierarchical clustering displayed a higher similarity with the APEX03-2_WS data set compared to the APEX03-2_Col-0 data set. Two interesting ROS correlation groups were observed in the heatmap. Group A showed that only the spaceflight transcriptome of WS positively correlated with the cytoplasmic ascorbate peroxidase knockout (KO-APX1) experiments, which represent cytoplasmic H2O2 ROS indices, whereas in the Col-0 background cytosolic ROS shows no correlation. Group B showed ecotype-related differences in the correlations associated with mitochondrial stress. Specifically, TDNA-AOX-MLD and Retenone-3h indices showed that if one ecotype had a positive correlation the other had no correlation. In addition, in the Retenone-12h and TDNA-AOX indices, the mixed ecotype transcriptome shows a similar trend to one of the two ecotypes. The control data set, which reflects terrestrial ecotype differences between Col-0 and WS, showed that many of the genes differentially expressed between the two ecotypes are associated with the ROS-scavenging mechanism. A representative transcriptome heatmap from the APEX03-2 spaceflight experiment that compared several significantly (P < 0.01) differentially expressed (>1 or −1 < log2 fold change) peroxidase genes between 4-day-old Col-0 and WS ecotypes illustrated that Col-0 alters the expression of many more peroxidase genes in spaceflight than does WS (Fig. 1B).

(A and B) DCF-DA ROS assay performed on wounded leaf tissues reveals that OMG1 affects cellular ROS production. (A) DCF-DA is a fluorogenic dye that measures hydroxyl, peroxyl and other ROS activity within the cell. A pipette tip was used to wound the surface of the leaves from the WT line, omg1 KO line and rbohd KO line (a known ROS-deficient mutant). Upon wounding, ROS is usually produced around the site of injury. The DCF-DA reagent is then oxidized by ROS resulting in appearance of green fluorescence. Plants were wounded and immediately placed in the DCF-DA solution for 20 min before visualized on the light microscope. (i) WT Col-0 leaves without wounding, (ii) WT Col-0 leaves, (iii) omg1 leaves and (iv) rbohd leaves were placed in DCF-DA solution immediately after wounding. In the WT plants green fluorescence around the wound site indicates the production of ROS. However, in the omg1 KO line and the rbohd KO line, ROS production was not detected. Images were taken on the Olympus BX51 compound scope at 10× magnification, exposure time 55 ms. Scale bars: 100 µm. (B) Quantification of fluorescence was performed using integrated density (IntDen) and corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) [CTCF = Integrated density − (Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings)] in ImageJ.

A strategy to avoid oxidative damage relies on the ability to deploy different antioxidants and ROS-scavenging/detoxifying enzymes to efficiently adjust their redox states. When subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight, plants respond by overexpressing more ROS- or redox-associated genes than comparable plants on the ground. ROS in its various forms and subcellular production sites can elicit distinct and diverse physiological, biochemical and molecular responses. It is possible that plants drew from diverse ROS response strategies to cope with spaceflight, an environment that is outside their evolutionary experience and therefore potentially stressful.

Although the overall root length at 11 days on orbit between the two ecotypes showed no significant difference, it was noted that the Col-0 ecotype showed a dramatic lag in root development during the first 48-h post-germination in orbit when compared to the WS ecotype, and that there are also ecotype-specific differences in root growth behaviour. One difference between the Col-0 and WS ecotypes is the regulation of class III peroxidase genes. In fact, two genes PE10 (AT1G49570) and PE59 (AT5G19890) that were up-regulated in the APEX03-2 Col-0 but remained unchanged in APEX03-2 WS (Fig. 1B) are involved in controlling the root cell elongation process. The differentially expressed peroxidase genes between the two ecotypes in the APEX03-2 spaceflight transcriptomes (Fig. 1B) reinforce the notion that different ecotypes utilize ROS differently to respond to their environment and suggest that in WS, these genes were already at a level appropriate for spaceflight acclimation and were therefore unchanged. In addition, the observed down-regulation of peroxidases in Col-0 was consonant with observations previously published. Since peroxidases are necessary for the general oxidoreduction of H2O2 in general, the down-regulation of peroxidases in spaceflight within Col-0 could contribute to Col-0-specific ROS signatures seen in clusters A and B of the ROSMETER analyses (Fig. 1A).",

Although OMG1’s role in the physiological adaptation of WS to spaceflight has yet to be discerned, its strong induction suggests that OMG1 contributes to a successful adjustment to that environment.

These conflicting results can be addressed by the different signalling pathways elicited by each stimulus. Responses to mechanical damage can be localized, systemic or both. In any case, the response involves the generation, translocation, perception and transduction of wound signals to activate the expression of wound‐inducible genes. In response to mechanical wounding, the central role for JA signalling is well established. However, many other compounds, such as oligopeptide systemin, oligosaccharides, phytohormones, hydraulic pressure or electrical pulses, have also been proposed to play a role in wound signalling. Early localized ROS induced by wounding, specifically O2•−, H2O2 and singlet oxygen, have been suggested to originate intracellularly from the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts.",

MAMP-induced ROS have been shown to originate from the apoplast through activation of NADPH oxidases as well as peroxidases. Although there are crosstalks between signalling pathways induced by mechanical wounding and flg22, there are also unique pathways induced by each stimulus that could attribute to the different results observed.

First, spaceflight experiments are useful platforms to discover novel gene functions and provide fundamental insights into terrestrial plant biology. Second, the response to spaceflight is genotype-specific and this understanding should be taken into consideration when defining the overall plant spaceflight response. WS and Col-0 differ in induction of OMG1 in spaceflight. Third, the maintenance of ROS homeostasis plays an important role as plants physiologically adapt to spaceflight.
