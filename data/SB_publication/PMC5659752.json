            "text": "The evolutionary success of parasitoid wasps, a highly diverse group of insects widely used in biocontrol, depends on a variety of life history strategies in conflict with those of their hosts. Drosophila melanogaster is a natural host of parasitic wasps of the genus Leptopilina. Attack by L. boulardi (Lb), a specialist wasp to flies of the melanogaster group, activates NF-κB-mediated humoral and cellular immunity. Inflammatory blood cells mobilize and encapsulate Lb eggs and embryos. L. heterotoma (Lh), a generalist wasp, kills larval blood cells and actively suppresses immune responses. Spiked virus-like particles (VLPs) in wasp venom have clearly been linked to its successful parasitism of Drosophila, but VLP composition and their biotic nature have remained mysterious. Our proteomics studies reveal that VLPs lack viral coat proteins but possess a pharmacopoeia of (a) eukaryotic vesicular transport system, (b) immunity, and (c) previously unknown proteins. These novel proteins distinguish Lh from Lb VLPs; notably, some proteins specific to Lh VLPs possess sequence similarities with bacterial secretion system proteins. Structure-informed analyses of an abundant Lh VLP surface/spike-tip protein, p40, reveal similarities to the needle-tip invasin proteins SipD/IpaD of Gram negative bacterial type 3 secretion systems that breach immune barriers and deliver virulence factors into mammalian cells. Our studies suggest that Lh VLPs represent a new class of extracellular organelles and share pathways for protein delivery with both eukaryotic microvesicles and bacterial surface secretion systems. Given their mixed prokaryotic/eukaryotic properties, we propose the term Mixed Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) to replace VLP.",

The VLP-producing generalist/specialist L. heterotoma (Lh)/L. boulardi (Lb) wasps differ greatly in their infection of their natural host D. melanogaster, as seen in the anterior lobes of the fly larval lymph glands. Hematopoietic progenitors are housed in the gland’s medulla (marked by Dome-Meso-GFP) and mature hemocytes, in the cortex (GFP-negative, Fig 1 B). Lb 17 infection induces lamellocyte differentiation (Fig 1 C), while Lh 14 attack causes cell loss in both the medulla and the cortex, and few cells survive (Fig 1 D). The differences in the virulence of Lh versus Lb is attributed to differences in the VLPs produced by these wasps and the mechanism of Lh-induced cell killing are not understood. VLPs from Lb 17 and Lh 14 differ in morphology; Lb 17 VLPs have fewer spikes and are somewhat larger than Lh VLPs (Fig 1 E, F) . A peripheral membrane lipid bilayer (~ 10 nm) surrounds Lh VLPs, which lack the typical coat-like structure found in some viruses (Fig 1 G). Because of their key role in wasp parasitism of Drosophila spp., we hypothesized that differences in the composition of spiked particles produced in the venom of both wasps underlie these contrasting infection strategies.",

Peptide sequences from each VLP proteome (Lh 14 and Lh NY wasps) were first aligned against RNA-Seq Lh 14 transcripts, translated to open reading frames (ORFs). We thus obtained a common set of Lh VLP proteins (present in both proteomes; Tables S1, S2) and verified these VLP protein sequences at > 90% identity against two Lh expressed sequence tags (ESTs; ~ 30 proteins or 20% and ~ 70 proteins or 45%  of the common proteome). To identify candidate pathogenicity effectors, we compared the common Lh VLP dataset to abdominal transcripts of Lb 17 and a distantly-related species Ganaspis sp.1 (G1) that lacks spiked VLPs (Fig 2). A summary of our major findings follows.",

To test this idea, we carried out ab initio modeling of p40. The knowledge-based energetics of the p40 model are similar to crystal structures of similar length (ProSA Z-Score = −6.23). 82% of model residues are found in expected local environments (3D Verify). Superimposition of the p40 model against IpaD confirmed the T3SS protein-like fold in p40 (Figs 4 E; S1 C).",

Furthermore, VLP gene loci were amplified not only from female Lh 14 genomes but also male wasp genomes, even though VLPs are not produced in males. BrdU incorporation studies did not support the possibility of DNA-based VLP replication in the venom gland (our unpublished results). The non-replicating nature of the particles, genomic encoding of VLP protein genes, and vesicular signature of their proteome strongly suggest that Lh VLPs are neither viruses nor endosymbiotic bacteria but instead represent a new class of genomically-encoded, microvesicle-like organelles. Extracellular vesicles are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and VLPs carry a diversity of potential immune-suppressive proteins.

While cytotoxic to macrophages, P. aeruginosa infection activates the NF-κB-dependent IMD antimicrobial pathway.

In this regard, characterization of the prokaryotic protein motifs that comprise nearly 10% of the novel proteins outlined above will be especially revealing. The molecular mechanisms by which MSEV proteins deplete and destroy its well-characterized hosts’ immune system will suggest how virulence factors are acquired by insect parasites, how these factors evolve, and how insects might serve as reservoirs of disease.

The next six generations of Lv wasps were cultivated on larvae raised on standard, antibiotic-free medium, to assure no direct drug effects. Isogenized control wasps did not receive antibiotic treatment and were otherwise reared the same way as experimental wasps. For PCR amplification of wasp genomic DNA, antibiotic-treated and control male and female wasps, no more than 1 week PE, were sorted into microfuge tubes and frozen at −20°C. Genomic DNA template was amplified for the absence or presence of (a) Lv-specific gatB and coxA genes of Wolbachia, and (b) VLP protein genes (p40 and Sm/LgGTPase01) (see Analyses of genomic sequences, below, and KRT). Results from all PCR amplification experiments supported the conclusions in this study.",

As indicated in the Wasp infections, dissections, and imaging subsection, n in this study refers to the whole lymph gland of an animal (i.e., two lobes). More than 35 lymph glands from larvae of different genotypes yielded consistent results after wasp infection. Similarly, examination of numerous VLPs in each sample, as well as repetition of different EM protocols provided supporting information regarding VLP morphologies. Confidence in proteomics results is based on peptide characterizations of purified VLP preparations from two independent strains of Lh. The criteria of agreement between multiple, independent methods for identification and annotation of VLP proteins (both novel and previously characterized) were met. Confidence in quantitative bioinformatics results (e.g., E values for BLAST results and domain predictions, RMSDs for protein model analyses, p-values for enrichments) is based on the algorithms intrinsic to these methods and is described in the corresponding primary references. Where possible, more than one computational approach (supported by different algorithms and metaservers) was used to strengthen interpretation by avoiding biases arising from a single computational methodology. No additional statistical analyses or methods to determine assumption credibility and/or sample size were conducted for this study.",

(C) The predicted\ngeometry of the G motifs in of SmGTPase01 active site (warm, orange tones)\nsuperimposed on that of HRas active site (1QRA; cool, blue tones). RMSD\n= 3.37 Å (calculation is based on the full-length structures and\nis normalized to 1QRA), TM-score = 0.74 [TM-Score > 0.5\nindicates the same fold]. Distances (Å) between functionally\ncritical residues of SmGTPase01 and HRas are indicated by dotted lines.\n(D) p40 domain architecture. SS = signal sequence; TM\n= transmembrane domain. Black arrows mark intron insertion sites. Based\non CDD prediction, the central domain shares sequence and structural similarity\nwith IpaD superfamily proteins. (E) Structural superposition of\nIpaD (blue, 2J0; residues 39-284) and p40 model (red, residues 28-187). The\nN-termini are oriented to the top right corner. The predicted signal sequence\nand C-terminal transmembrane helix were omitted for modeling. RMSD =\n4.73 Å, TM-score = 0.56225. (F) Structural\nsuperposition of p40 model (red) to chicken spectrin (green, 1CUN; RMSD\n= 2.9 Å) and to human plectin (blue, 3PDY; RMSD = 3.0\nÅ), using the DALI server.
