In this review, we highlight the application of omics, including transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, multi-omics, and integrated omics in the study of spaceflown C. elegans, and discuss the impact, use, and future direction of this branch of research. We highlight the variety of molecular alterations that occur in response to spaceflight, most notably changes in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation. These transcriptional features are reproducible and evident across many spaceflown species (e.g., mice and astronauts), supporting the use of C. elegans as a model organism to study spaceflight physiology with translational capital. Integrating tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics approaches, which quantitatively link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations, will facilitate the identification of candidate regulatory molecules for therapeutic intervention and thus represents the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research.",

            "text": "Since Yuri Gagarin first traveled to space in 1961, human spaceflight activity has grown rapidly. One of the most notable events to date was the 1998 launch of the International Space Station (ISS), a lower Earth orbiting research platform, which allows astronauts to live and work in space for up to a year at a time. The microgravity environment of space presents an extreme environmental stressor, which induces a multitude of physiological maladaptations including, but not limited to, skeletal muscle and bone loss, cardiovascular decline, immune compromise, neuronal damage, and decreased gray matter volume. These resemble some of the adverse health changes associated with chronological aging on Earth, and additionally serve as an accelerated model of other non-communicable health concerns such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. As people look to travel further into space and for longer periods than ever before—owing to the rise in commercial spaceflight and increasingly lower cost access to space—understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of spaceflight-induced maladaptation is essential to developing effective countermeasures that promote safe space travel and also benefit health on Earth.",

            "text": "Human and rodent studies have provided invaluable insight into the mechanistic regulation of the microgravity phenotype; however, they are limited by significant operational (e.g., crew time, human/rodent numbers, and sample feasibility) and economical (e.g., high costs) constraints. Alternative model organisms are, therefore, required to achieve the experimental power necessary to draw conclusions on the causes of space-induced health decline. Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a non-parasitic, microscopic (∼0.25–1 mm) nematode characterized by a short lifespan (∼3 weeks), large brood size, fully sequenced genome, multiple evolutionary conserved mechanisms, ease of culture, and low expense, presenting a primary biologically relevant model for spaceflight research that is relatively cheap and feasible. In fact, C. elegans spaceflight experiments have been conducted since the time of the space shuttle. Previous studies have shown that C. elegans can mate, reproduce, and undergo embryonic development during spaceflight, and they are also susceptible to radiation-induced mutations during spaceflight. However, since these experiments were performed on ordinary agar medium, the effects of strong hydrostatic pressure adhesion between the C. elegans and the agar surface could not be ruled out. Therefore, in examining the effects of microgravity, a liquid culture was devised. The first space experiment to test the difference between liquid and agar media could not be analyzed due to an unforeseen accident on Columbia’s return. However, the C. elegans were found alive a few days later, protected by a sturdy container. Since then, our space experiments have been conducted using CeMM (C. elegans Maintenance Medium) and E. coli OP-50 liquid media. In addition, C. elegans permit the use of genetic and molecular tools (e.g., genetic mutants), to dissect specific biological pathways and trial emerging countermeasures, such as the efficacy of preclinical drugs. Since C. elegans display high molecular, metabolic, and physiologic orthology with people, with as much as 83% of the C. elegans proteome sharing homologous genes with humans, they serve as efficient model organisms to understand (human) disease processes. For example, their use as a biomedical research model organism has been invaluable in the study of Alzheimer disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Specific to spaceflight, C. elegans successfully live in microgravity and display reduced movement capacity, analogous to the decline in muscle function observed in astronauts post-flight, demonstrating the suitability of C. elegans as a model organism to study the effects of spaceflight on physiology. Therefore, using C. elegans to uncover the precise molecular mechanisms regulating adaptations to microgravity can significantly accelerate our understanding of the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological decline in humans.",

            "text": "Recently, there has been an exponential increase in the use of “omics” technologies and informatic tools to probe the etiology of, and develop countermeasures for, pathological states, including spaceflight. The application of omics seeks to establish the sum of the parts within a biological system, rather than identifying individual components, promoting a holistic rather than reductive path of biological study. In addition to the beneficial “systems biology” approach, omics can capitalize on pre-existing biological samples (i.e., samples that were collected before the omics “boom” and “bio-banked” samples), which are particularly rare in the context of spaceflight. Recently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched project “GeneLab” to allow free and unrestricted access to omics data from spaceflight experiments to researchers all over the globe. The success of this open-science model has maximized the use of scarce spaceflight biological samples and led to several discoveries otherwise not possible, such as the identification of spaceflight CO2 levels as a confounding variable in the animal enclosure modules used in rodent experiments. More recently, the European Space Agency (ESA)-funded Space Omics Topical Team has supported new and ongoing ESA scientific community activities that focus on the application and exploitation of omics research in space. Indeed, omics technology has been applied to spaceflight research using C. elegans, leading to a more complete understanding of biological processes that occur in response to spaceflight, although these works remain to be consolidated.",

To do this, we provide an overview of the available omics literature, including hyper-, micro-, and simulated gravity scenarios, highlighting key biological themes and, where relevant, highlight how the molecular flight-responsive signatures in worms correspond with known molecular and/or functional adaptations reported in higher animals and humans. We also summarize the impact of the C. elegans space omics literature to date and highlight what we believe are the next frontiers in C. elegans space omics research. Although previous reviews have appreciated the use of C. elegans as a model organism for spaceflight research, these reviews have either not focused on omics or are non-comprehensive due to geographical constraints. Thus, global efforts combining C. elegans and omics in space remain to be detailed.",

ANC-1 is involved in nuclear anchorage and positioning, as well as the positioning of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations to ANC-1 negatively affect the health of C. elegans, with ANC-1 mutants displaying smaller body sizes, changes to the shape of the nucleus, fragmentation of the endoplasmic reticulum, and movement of the nucleus and endoplasmic reticulum during body movement. Second, multiple metabolic proteins in all stages of cellular respiration, including glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle, gluconeogenesis, and the electron transport chain, were found in significantly reduced levels (Figure 1).",

In one such comparative analysis, the authors aimed to understand whether the transcriptional profiles of microgravity are the inverse of the hypergravity expression pattern, a hypothesis worthy of investigation considering the divergent physiological adaptations to microgravity versus hypergravity. The authors found that while most common gene signatures were similarly up- or downregulated, genes pertaining to the Gene Ontology term “metabolic regulation” displayed opposing regulation, being upregulated in hypergravity and downregulated in microgravity.

Proteomic analysis from the same spaceflight mission (ICE-FIRST) found the core thick filament protein, paramyosin, was reduced in spaceflown samples. Additionally, spaceflight reduced troponin T, which binds tropomyosin and tethers the troponin complex to the thin filament, but increased troponin T phosphorylation.

That mechanical load is the partial driver of muscle changes in space is further supported by other previous worm space microarray analyses, wherein dystrophin (a highly mechanosensitive molecule that plays a key role in maintaining muscle structure/function) was shown to be important in the omics response to spaceflight, particularly with respect to neuromuscular/cytoskeletal changes. In fact, transcriptional changes in worms generally appear more widespread in the spaceflight environment than with space radiations alone, with C. elegans work thus indicating that microgravity is the more predominant effector of spaceflight omics changes. More specifically, the space radiation dose on the ISS is ∼0.5–1 mSv per day, including ∼50 charged particles/sr/cm2 with high linear energy transfer (>10 keV/μm). Since an adult nematode C. elegans is ∼1 mm long and 0.05 mm wide, the probability of a direct hit by charged particles is relatively low. In addition, DNA damage by heavy particle radiation, not only ionizing radiation, is efficiently repaired in meiotic oocytes, which make up the majority of nematode adult gonads, because of their high homologous recombination activity. Thus, it is challenging to precisely evaluate the effects of space radiation in omics analyses using a large number of C. elegans cultured for a short period. Instead, the effects of space radiation on C. elegans are mainly studied by examining the frequency of mutations that can be observed in each individual nematode. Thus, while it appears from studies in C. elegans that radiation exposure in lower Earth orbit is not a major contributor to observed omics changes, the effects in higher mammals and humans, as well as the potential effects beyond in lower Earth orbit and the protective effects of the Van Allen belts, render the consequences of spaceflight radiation on omics/biology uncertain.",

Regardless, given that FoxO signaling is a highly conserved regulatory pathway across species, such worm omics data should provide a strong basis to accelerate mechanistic understanding of poor spaceflight adaptations of higher organisms.

These multiple omics approaches can be integrated (i.e., at the computational analysis stage) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the condition-specific crosstalk between different biological levels, therein providing a better understanding of microgravity-inducing mechanisms and the identification of novel candidates for therapeutic intervention. Indeed, this approach has been taken in C. elegans to investigate responses to aging, starvation, and antibiotics, albeit not in the context of spaceflight.",

Indeed, it is possible to isolate and sequence individual tissues derived from C. elegans, and since spaceflight can induced a wide variety of maladaptations across many organs, understanding tissue-specific responses to microgravity is necessary in order to precisely underpin regulatory mechanisms and develop targeted and effective countermeasures against spaceflight-induced maladaptations.",

            "text": "Further, conventional microarray and RNA-sequencing approaches do not provide spatial information, and tissue-specific transcriptomics only partially solves this problem since it still takes into account ubiquitously expressed genes (i.e., housekeeper genes). Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging method to overcome these limitations, which combines RNA-sequencing with serial tissue sectioning to identify tissue-specific spatiotemporal gene responses. By adapting the RNA tomography approach originally developed for zebrafish, Ebbing and co-authors were able to successfully apply spatial transcriptomics to C. elegans, which was considered a major challenge due to the limited amount of mRNA that can be extracted from individual sections of small organisms. The authors individually froze and cryosectioned (20 μm) C. elegans, followed by RNA extraction and processing using CEL-seq (to overcome the challenges of low input). Using this combination of tools, the authors were able to detect an average of 16,394 genes in young wild-type adult hermaphrodites, equating to 93% of genes detected in bulk RNA-sequencing experiments, and they also demonstrated regional expression was highly indicative of function. Thus, spatial transcriptomics offers a highly sensitive method to generate complex data, and develop deeper understanding of tissue organization, or disorganization, in disease. Spatial transcriptomics has been used to create tissue atlases that have served not only particular use in creating detailed maps of the nervous system of mice but also furthered understanding of important topics in biology like heart development. Currently, the application of C. elegans spatial transcriptomics is in its infancy with only three publications known to date, none of which have been conducted in the context of microgravity. Similarly, cell-specific proteomics methodologies that permit analysis of body wall muscles, neurons, and pharyngeal muscles have been developed but are yet to be exploited in the context of microgravity.",

In the context of simulated microgravity, Zhao and colleagues demonstrated the temporal induction of oxidative stress and the underlying mechanisms.

            "text": "C. elegans represents a cheap and feasible organism to study the mechanisms regulating phenotypic adaptations in response to microgravity. We highlight that the application of omics analysis to spaceflight research has identified many ways that C. elegans respond to microgravity, at the level of the transcriptome, proteome, and epigenome. Notably, microgravity elicits transcriptional responses with microgravity robustly regulating genes related to muscle locomotion and metabolism (Figure 1). Similarly, proteomic changes in microgravity represent robust declines in cytoskeletal and metabolic proteins, which may underpin the pathophysiological phenotype associated with microgravity, particularly muscle decline. Importantly, these major transcriptional signatures are reproducible despite substantial differences in culturing conditions. Future work should consider using emerging omics approaches, such as multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics, to unravel tissue-specific spatiotemporal responses to microgravity in C. elegans. Where possible, such experiments should adopt, or at least consider, consortium-devised omics-related working pipelines in order to standardize experimental design, such as those developed by the International Standards for Space Omics Processing. In turn, this will facilitate future comparative omics investigations, thus extracting as much insight as possible from rare space omics experiments. This will lead to the identification of the fundamental mechanisms regulating (mal)adaptations to microgravity, benefiting health while in space and on Earth (e.g., aging, diabetes).",
