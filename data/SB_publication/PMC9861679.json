Our previous experiments indicated that low-speed clinorotation may itself trigger directional root tip curvature. In this project, we have investigated the root curvature response to low-speed clinorotation using Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon seedlings as models. We show that low-speed clinorotation triggers root tip curvature in which direction is dictated by gravitropism during the first half-turn of clinorotation. We also show that the angle of root tip curvature is modulated by the speed of clinorotation. Arabidopsis mutations affecting gravity susception (pgm) or gravity signal transduction (arg1, toc132) are shown to affect the root tip curvature response to low-speed clinorotation. Furthermore, low-speed vertical clinorotation triggers relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the lateral membrane of Arabidopsis root cap statocytes, and creates a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip. Together, these observations support a role for gravitropism in modulating root curvature responses to clinorotation. Interestingly, distinct Brachypodium distachyon accessions display different abilities to develop root tip curvature responses to low-speed vertical clinorotation, suggesting the possibility of using genome-wide association studies to further investigate this process.",

Overall, this process contributes to a plant’s ability to anchor itself into the soil, actively seek water and nutrients within its growth substrate, exchange gases, photosynthesize, and reproduce. Consequently, gravitropism is a key environmental response that allows plants to thrive under diverse environmental conditions, thereby contributing to plant fitness and productivity in their natural ecological niches as well as in agricultural settings.",

This is followed by transduction into a biochemical signal through a process that remains largely unexplained, the formation of an auxin gradient across the gravistimulated organ, transmission of the gradient to the site of response, and differential cell elongation on opposite flanks of the organ, leading to a curvature response, usually upward for shoots and downward for roots (reviewed in).",

However, this process leads to a fast cytoplasmic alkalinization of the statocytes upon gravistimulation, accompanied by a change in polarity of the cell associated with the transcytotic relocalization of the auxin efflux facilitators PIN3 and PIN7 to the new bottom membrane. This relocalization is dependent upon the proper functioning of key regulators in the statocytes, including ALTERED RESPONSE TO GRAVITY 1 (ARG1) and its paralog ARG1-like 2 (ARL2), MODIFIER OF arg1 1 (MAR1/TOC75) and MAR2/TOC132, LAZY, RCC1-LIKE DOMAIN (RLD), and ADENOSINE KINASE 1 (ADK1). Additionally, mutations in genes that encode enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis, such as pgm-1, affect gravitropism mostly by decreasing the density of statocyte amyloplasts, thereby affecting gravity susception. Finally, PIN protein phosphorylation at conserved Ser residues has been shown to also modulate PIN3 relocalization in the statocytes and its auxin transport activity (reviewed in).",

Rootward auxin transport in the peripheral tissues of the root is mediated by AUX1 and PIN2 auxin influx and efflux facilitators, respectively, as well as ABC transporters. The PIN2 protein is localized in the plasma membrane mostly on the shootward side of the lateral cap and epidermal cells, dictating the shootward transport of auxin through cell files. Its recycling between the endosome and plasma membrane, and the regulation of its stability, are critical for its function in auxin transport and gravitropism. Its abundance within the plasma membrane of transporting cells is enhanced by increased auxin levels and GOLVEN peptide signaling on the bottom flank, a process that reinforces the auxin gradient across the root tip as it moves toward the transition zone. Furthermore, PIN2-mediated reflux of auxin from the peripheral tissues back into the vasculature stream toward the root tip also occurs at the transition zone, contributing significantly to the modulation of root gravitropism.",

Early studies suggested that the curvature response of a plant organ to gravistimulation varies linearly as a function of the logarithm of the dose of gravistimulation, itself defined as the product of gravity intensity by time of stimulation (g.s). Quantifying tip angle for distinct doses of initial gravistimulation led to dose–response curves that fit logarithmic functions. Extension of the corresponding best-fit functions to the time axis under 1 g allowed the determination of the presentation time, defined as the threshold stimulation time needed to produce curvature (reviewed in). This method has been used extensively to estimate the gravisensitivity of plant organs despite ignoring the fact that very short periods of gravistimulation well below the presentation time can still induce gravicurvature when applied repeatedly. The threshold time of intermittent gravistimulation leading to gravicurvature (the perception time) is shorter than 1 s, suggesting the gravisensing machinery is exquisitely sensitive to reorientation.",

A recent and careful investigation of the impact of various forms of clinorotation on plant organs growth revealed that slow horizontal clinorotation at 1 RPM induces stress responses in root statocytes and lower endodermal cells, whereas fast clinorotation in the range of 60 RPM leads to the directional root growth response to a force that results from both gravity and the centrifugal acceleration.

Indeed, if seedlings are positioned vertically on a clinostat and rotation is initiated at a speed of 0.5 RPM, their organs will be exposed to a unidirectional gravistimulus over the first half-turn of clinorotation, which should last 60 s, before being exposed to a gravistimulus from the opposite direction. If the first half-turn of gravistimulation is sufficiently long enough to induce a persistent polarity in the statocytes, it should be sufficient to promote curvature at the end of clinorotation. In fact, our previous experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of clinorotation on Arabidopsis root skewing on hard agar surfaces uncovered the existence of clinostat-dependent root tip curvatures that were compatible with this “clinostat effect”.",

We demonstrate the development of root tip curvature in both species at low speeds of clinorotation, and show that mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and/or signal transduction interfere with this clinostat effect. We also show that low-speed clinorotation leading to root tip curvature promotes the relocalization of the PIN3 auxin efflux facilitator to the side membrane of the root cap statocytes and the development of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root tip.

The best-fit models identified in these experiments closely matched the observed data, with R2 values often exceeding 0.9 (Figure 3). Their intersection with the X axis defines the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to determine the polarity of root tip curvature. We named this parameter the realization time (TR). In the experiments shown in Figure 3C, the roots of wild type Col seedlings displayed a TR of 35 s. Two additional independent trials led to similar TR estimates for Arabidopsis wild type Col roots (Supplemental Figure S5). On the other hand, similar experiments carried out with two distinct mar2 (toc132) mutants showed longer realization times of 54.7 s and 62.6 s, respectively (Supplemental Figure S6A).

To investigate the possible contribution of additional rounds of clinorotation (beyond the first half-turn) to curvature specification, we modified the clinorotation experiment to first include one or more curvature-inducing cycles at the beginning of the experiment (a phase we call “inductive”), and followed it with a phase of non-inductive 3 RPM clinorotation to allow curvature development (schematized in Figure 4A, left panel). The inductive phase included one, two, three, four, or five cycles of clinorotation at a speed of 0.2 RPM. Two controls included one experiment without an inductive phase (all cycles at 3 RPM), and a second experiment with all cycles being inductive at 0.2 RPM. The results shown in Figure 4 indicate that continuous clinorotation at 3 RPM is not sufficient to induce a significant root tip curvature relative to non-clinorotated controls (ST), as expected. Similarly, neither one, two, or three cycles of inductive clinorotation were insufficient to promote the clinostat effect. However, an inductive phase of four or five cycles at 0.2 RPM followed by 18 h at 3 RPM led to root tip curvatures similar to those generated by continuous clinorotation at 0.2 RPM (Figure 4). Hence, only four inductive clinorotation cycles at 0.2 RPM are sufficient to trigger strong root tip curvature similar to that triggered by continuous rotation at this speed (Figure 4).",

As expected, strong signal asymmetry was observed across the root tips of 1 h gravistimulated seedlings, with a dramatic signal decrease on the lower side of the root (; Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Interestingly, an asymmetrical VENUS signal was also apparent across the root tip after 1 h of low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), with a lower signal on the root tip side that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation (Figure 5A; Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal asymmetry persisted after 2 and 6 h of clinorotation, although the asymmetry was weaker at these later time points than after 1 h (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B). Signal quantification confirmed significant signal asymmetry upon both GS and low-speed (0.2 RPM) clinorotation (Figure 5A, Supplemental Figure S7A,B).

By constantly rotating around one or two axes, these devices simulate weightlessness by averaging a plant’s orientation relative to gravity at each rotation cycle. Consequently, the plant is never exposed to gravity from one side for long enough to trigger a tropic response. Under these conditions, the plant organs are expected to display growth behaviors that are comparable to those seen under microgravity as long as the speed of rotation remains sufficiently low to keep the centrifugal force below the limit of detection by the organism (reviewed in). In plants, clinostats have been used rather effectively to evaluate the effect of microgravity on processes as diverse as tropic responses, plant morphology, metabolism, organ growth, cell division, organelle morphology, and nutrient uptake, to cite just a few examples. They have also been extensively used to investigate plant organs’ sensitivity to gravistimulation (reviewed in).",

Furthermore, the clinostat effect should be associated with the formation of a lateral auxin gradient across the root tip, a process accompanied by relocalization of the PIN3 and PIN7 auxin efflux facilitators to the lateral membrane of columella statocytes early during clinorotation (reviewed in). Our results are consistent with both assumptions. Indeed, mutations that affect early phases of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana strongly affect root tip responses to low-speed clinorotation (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S4). This includes a mutation in the PGM gene, which encodes phosphoglucomutase, an enzyme that contributes to starch biosynthesis. Mutations in this gene have been reported to affect starch content in the amyloplasts of plant statocytes, thereby affecting their ability to sediment in response to gravistimulation. The defect in mutant amyloplast sedimentation correlated with altered gravitropic response in roots, hypocotyls, and stems of Arabidopsis, in agreement with a role for amyloplast sedimentation in gravity sensing. Importantly, previous studies of amyloplast sedimentation in the root cap statocytes of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings under the same growth conditions as our study have demonstrated significant sedimentation after only 1 or 2 min of reorientation, which is compatible with the time needed for the clinostat to complete its first half-turn under the inductive conditions used in this project. Taken together, these results are compatible with a role for amyloplast sedimentation, during the first half-turn of clinorotation (due to plant reorientation within the gravity field), in clinostat-induced root tip curvature.",

TOC132/MAR2 encodes a component of the translocon of the outer membrane of chloroplasts complex located on the surface of plastids, which contributes to protein import from the cytoplasm into the plastids and impacts gravity signal transduction. In the experiments described in this manuscript, mutations in this gene strongly affected root tip curvature responses to low-speed clinorotation despite being present in a wild type ARG1 background.

This clinostat-induced signal gradient occurred within 1 h of clinorotation and decreased after 2 and 6 h. It occurred under low-speed clinorotation (0.2 RPM), but was not observed under non-inductive conditions at 3 RPM or in seedlings that were not clinorotated. Its intensity was lower than the sharp gradient observed in response to direct gravistimulation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7). Interestingly, the PIN3 protein was also shown to relocalize to the side of the columella cells after 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation. This relocalization resulted in PIN3 accumulation on the side membrane of the statocytes that was directed toward gravity during the first half-turn of clinorotation. It was less pronounced than observed in response to direct gravistimulation, and it was not observed under 3 RPM rotation (Figure 5; Supplemental Figure S7).",

The levels of PIN3 relocalization and steepness of the lateral auxin gradient triggered by 0.2 RPM clinorotation were not as strong as those established upon direct gravistimulation because the latter provides a continuous stimulus over time, with progressively decreasing inclination, whereas the stimulus provided during clinorotation occurs only for a limited time (half the period of clinorotation) before being interrupted by opposite inclination. The observation of increased curvature angles generated by clinorotation of increased periodicity is compatible with this explanation (Figure 3).",

When extended to the time axis, this function allows the estimation of a parameter we called realization time (TR), which we defined as the minimal period of half-turn clinorotation needed to set up a polarity of tip curvature response to clinorotation. While this approach was inspired from the presentation time analysis carried out to evaluate gravisensitivity of plant organs, it is important to recognize that the realization time parameter differs from the presentation time because in TR analysis, the same stimulus is provided at each following inductive cycle during clinorotation, whereas a single limited gravistimulus is provided prior to horizontal clinorotation in presentation time analysis. In this sense, the realization time is more reminiscent of the perception time parameter, defining sensitivities based on repeated short periods of gravistimulation. This conclusion is supported by the observation of a need for a minimum of four cycles of inductive clinorotation to allow the development of a significant curvature response at the end of the experiment (Figure 4). Future experiments will be aimed at elucidating the relationship existing between curvature response and total stimulation to evaluate possible reciprocity between number of inductive cycles and periodicity of each cycle as components of stimulation. Experiments have also been initiated to elucidate the potential impact of different speeds of clinorotation during the response (non-inductive) phase on the final curvature.",

It should be pointed out that the experiments we describe here also did not trigger any responses at 1 RPM. However, clear curvature responses were observed to clinorotations at 0.5 and 0.2 RPM. We also note that different accessions of Brachypodium distachyon displayed dramatically distinct responses to 0.2 and 0.5 RPM clinorotations, with Bd21-3 showing strong responses at 0.2 RPM and a weaker response at 0.5 RPM, whereas Ron-2 displayed no responses at all (Figure 6). Similarly, mutations affecting early steps of gravity sensing and signal transduction in Arabidopsis thaliana affected root curvature responses to inductive clinorotation (Figure 2). On the other hand, wild type Arabidopsis seedlings of the Col and Ws ecotypes were previously shown to display significant curvature responses to clinorotation at 1 RPM under distinct experimental conditions, whereas they showed no curvatures at 1 RPM in the experiments described here.

Half of the plates were oriented such that their lids were directed to the right of the clinostat, the other half with the lids directed to the left. This allowed us to test the effects of both clockwise and counterclockwise clinorotations on seedling root growth in the same experiment. In all experiments described in this manuscript, the direction of clinorotation (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) is defined based on observations from the back side (through the agar-based medium). In some vertical clinorotation experiments, half of the plates were transferred into the clinostat chamber with seedlings oriented vertically downward (roots directed upward) so that their roots would be exposed to gravistimulation from the other side during the first half-turn of clinorotation relative to those starting the experiment in the normal upright position. In this set of experiments, clinorotation was initiated immediately after transferring the plates into the clinostat chamber.",

The two-chamber-based clinostat was built by modifying a Thomas Scientific HYBAID hybridization oven. In this system, two chambers were located on opposite sides of the horizontal axis of the clinostat. The first chamber was loaded with plates carrying seedlings in an upright position, whereas chamber 2 was loaded with plates in the opposite orientation (upside down seedlings at the start of clinorotation; see Supplemental Figure S2C,D). In both chambers, half of the plates were inserted with their lids directed toward the left of the clinostat (clockwise rotation), the other half with the lids directed toward the right (counterclockwise rotation).",

Plates were then mounted into a clinostat and stabilized for more than 4 h in the dark to avoid mechanical stimuli. After different periods of clinorotation (defined in the text), a coverslip was placed on top of the seedlings, and the mount was transferred to the confocal microscope stage for imaging. This sandwiching approach allowed us to unambiguously relate reporter signal asymmetry to clinorotation polarity for each sample. Images were taken with a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using excitation and emission wavelengths of 514 and 570 nm to detect VENUS, or 488 and 546 nm to detect PIN3-GFP. The detector gain range was set up for 730 to 850 nm and the scan mode was “by frame”. Seedlings were rotated clockwise but imaged from either side of the coverslip depending on sample setup. Signal intensity was measured using ImageJ (Plot Profile). A heatmap was generated by inputting the grey image of the signal channel and using the Look-Up Tables (LUTs) plug-in from ImageJ to reflect the difference in intensity by color.",

Non-clinorotated (ST) and constantly gravistimulated (GS) controls were included in this experiment. Panel (A) shows representative confocal images of root tip DII::VENUS fluorescence signals under the rotation conditions and times defined at the top; the middle images show the confocal DII-VENUS fluorescence signals merged with bright field views of the same roots; the bottom images show the results of signal quantification in the form of signal intensity heatmaps generated using the LUT plug-in from the ImageJ. Scale bars represent 50 µm. Panel (B) demonstrates how low-speed clinorotation leads to mild PIN3 relocalization in the columella cells of the root cap. 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings (Col accession) expressing a PIN3-GFP construct were either clinorotated at 0.2 and 3 RPM in darkness, gravistimulated, or grown straight downward without clinorotation or gravistimulation (ST) for 0, 1, 2, or 6 h. The PIN3-GFP fluorescent signal was then analyzed by confocal microscopy. A mild polarization of the signal appeared in the columella cells of the root cap (yellow arrows) within 1 h of 0.2 RPM clinorotation and continued over a period of 6 h. Similar polarization was not seen upon 3 RPM clinorotation or when the seedlings were neither gravistimulated nor clinorotated. Quantification of VENUS signals from panel (A) were presented in Supplemental Figure S7A.
