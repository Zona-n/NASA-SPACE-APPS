Under investigation here is whether epigenetic modulations, similar to those that occur in terrestrial stress responses, have a functional role in spaceflight physiological adaptation. The Advanced Plant Experiment-04 – Epigenetic Expression experiment examined the role of cytosine methylation in spaceflight adaptation. The experiment was conducted onboard the International Space Station, and evaluated the spaceflight-altered, genome-wide methylation profiles of two methylation-regulating gene mutants [methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)] along with a wild-type Col-0 control.",

The met1-7 plants suffered less, with their morphology affected by spaceflight in a manner similar to that of the Col-0 controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spaceflight were dramatically different in the elp2-5 and met1-7 plants compared to Col-0, indicating that the disruptions in these mutants resulted in a reprogramming of their spaceflight responses, especially in elp2-5. Many of the genes comprising the spaceflight transcriptome of each genotype were differentially methylated in spaceflight. In Col-0 the majority of the DEGs were representative of the now familiar spaceflight response, which includes genes associated with cell wall remodeling, pathogen responses and ROS signaling. However, the spaceflight transcriptomes of met1-7 and elp2-5 each presented patterns of DEGs that are almost completely different than Col-0, and to each other. Further, the DEGs of the mutant genotypes suggest a more severe spaceflight stress response in the mutants, particularly in elp2-5.",

Many terrestrial abiotic stresses, such as salt stress, heat stress, drought, water stress, and phosphate starvation induce epigenetic changes that aid in the adaptation process (e.g.,). The genes differentially expressed in response to spaceflight share similarities with many documented terrestrial responses. Hallmarks of spaceflight responses include differential expression of genes involved in pathways associated with cell wall remodeling, reactive oxygen species (ROS), pathogen attacks, wounding, salt stress, drought stress, and hormone signaling. Plants further respond to spaceflight with changes in DNA methylation, again similarly to the epigenetic effects that occur during terrestrial stresses. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression alterations occurred in plants grown for part of their life cycle in a satellite experiment. Arabidopsis grown from seed on orbit in the International Space Station (ISS) showed changes in specific DNA methylation contexts, with some of those changes associated with differentially expressed genes (DEGs).",

In comparison to roots, spaceflight leaves show higher methylation levels within the protein-coding genes compared to ground controls (GCs). A large proportion of the genes that are differentially expressed and differentially methylated are associated with ROS signaling. ROS can act as signaling molecules in responses to an array of plant stressors and there is growing evidence of an interplay between ROS metabolism and epigenetic regulation during acclimation in terrestrial environments. DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications have been reported to play a role in regulating the innate immune response and pathogen response. Many components of the gene networks associated with these pathogen-associated pathways are also differentially expressed by plants in spaceflight. This commonality of terrestrial environmental responses with spaceflight responses begged the question: do plants use similar tools to regulate genes in response to spaceflight?",

            "text": "DNA methylation in plants occurs in three main contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (where H = A, C, or T). Methylation in each context is directly maintained by a distinct pathway and set of enzymes which include: Methyltransferase 1 (MET1), decreased DNA methylation 1 (DDM1)1, and variant in methylation in the CG context, SUVH4-deposited H3K9me2 and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) in the CHG context, and CMT2 in the CHH context. In addition to these direct enzymatic regulators of DNA methylation, a number of genes indirectly affect DNA methylation through RNA intermediates. RNA-directed DNA methylation facilitates the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases. In plants, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct de novo DNA methylation and maintenance of DNA methylation at asymmetrical CHH sites through the polymerase II (Pol II)-related RNA polymerases Pol IV and Pol V. In Arabidopsis, the siRNA effector ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) exists in a complex with domains rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) for methylation of the template strand for RNA polymerase V-mediated non-coding RNA transcripts. The Elongator complex is a co-factor of RNA Pol II, and ELP2 is the most likely subunit to interact with the siRNA machinery. To explore the effects of these two DNA methylation pathways in conditioning the spaceflight response, we chose MET1 as a representative of the proteins directly involved in methylation and ELP2 as a model regulator that affects methylation during stress responses through RNA intermediates and regulation of methyltransferases.",

MET1 is one of several methylation enzymes that also modify the epigenome of plants as part of stress responses. The role MET1 plays in maintaining the CG methylation profile is also important for the subsequent inheritance of those epigenomic changes. Loss of MET1 function non-specifically enhances resistance to bacterial infections. Many of the genes differentially regulated in methylation-mutant met1-3 lines (Supplementary Material,) show a substantial overlap with genes that are differentially expressed in response to spaceflight including genes involved in defense, transcription, response to hormone stimulus and phosphorylation. These methylation mutant transcriptome profiles establish that differential methylation in the genome is central to facilitating stress responses in Arabidopsis, suggesting the hypothesis that the stress response elicited by spaceflight in Arabidopsis may also have an epigenetic component that could involve regulation by MET1.",

Although loss of any component can compromise Elongator complex function the subunits have independent activity and can also function as sub-complexes (e.g.,). Elongator proteins were initially identified in plants as important to various aspects of growth, development, and immune response. Elongator Proteins ELP3 and ELP2 both contribute epigenomic regulation of gene expression in response to developmental and immune response pathways in Arabidopsis. ELP3 exhibits HAT activity while ELP2 interacts with components of the siRNA machinery. In plants, siRNAs can induce cytosine methylation by recruitment of the DNA methyl transferase DRM2 through RNA-directed DNA methylation (e.g.,), and it is by this mode of action that ELP2 regulates plant development and stress responses (reviewed in:).",

Functionally, ELP2 is a regulator of NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) and accelerates the immune responses in Arabidopsis through epigenetic modification of DNA methylation. Deletion of the gene encoding ELP2 has substantial impact on pathogen-induced transcription, and also impacts fundamental processes such as root development and auxin signaling. Many of the genes differentially expressed between elp2 mutants and wild-type plants include hallmarks of abiotic stress responses. Further, many of the genes differentially expressed in elp2 mutants are also represented in Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptomes and spaceflight methylome (e.g.,).

Plants in the Veggie hardware (both on the ISS and in the ISSES chamber) were exposed to constant light conditions of 100–135 μmoles/m2s PAR for 11 days before being harvested into Kennedy space center fixation tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlaterTM (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, United States). All of the plants from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at −80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable GC samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard −80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was intended as a biological replicate and kept separate in tissue preparation operations, but the mass values drove the decision to allow a combination of two plates to comprise a replicate, which resulted in a total of four biological replicates for each of the genotypes and treatments for the analyses. Leaf and root tissues from each sample were dissected using an Olympus stereo-microscope. FromBioanalyzer and quantified with the each plate, the materials from three individual plants were pooled for RNA extraction and transcriptome analyses, and materials from 10 to 15 individual plants from that same plate were allocated for DNA extraction. Molecular analyses were performed on leaf and root tissues dissected from each of the three genotypes. One plate was lost, (met1-7, spaceflight C6) and so one of the spaceflight met1-7 replicates was composed of plants from a single plate rather than two plates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) was performed for the methylome analysis and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) for the transcriptome analysis. To summarize, for each genotype under each environmental condition, a total seven (spaceflight met1-7) or eight (all other genotypes and treatments) plates were used to conduct WGBS and RNASeq analyses, four biological replicates for each assay.",

Briefly, 700–1,700 ng of genomic DNA (>5 Kb in length) observed on the TapeStation Genomic Screen Tape (Agilent) was processed for sequencing library construction. DNA was transferred into 6 × 16 mm glass microtubes with AFA fiber and pre-slit snap caps (Cat# 520045, Covaris, Inc.) and sheared into an average fragment size of ∼400 bp using the Covaris S220 ultrasonic disruptor. Short DNA fragments (<100 bp) were removed using AMPure magnetic beads (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter) at a 1:1 bead to sample ratio. 100–250 ng of clean, fragmented DNA was used for the Illumina sequencing library construction. Both the NEBNext® UltraTM II DNA Illumina construction kit (Cat# E7645S, NEB) and the Illumina-specific methylated and dual-index barcoded adaptors (Cat# E7600S NEB) were used as described in the manufacturer’s guidelines. Illumina libraries (containing methylated adaptors) were subjected to sodium bisulfite treatment using the EZ DNA Methylation Direct kit (ZYMO Research, Cat #D5020) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting libraries were enriched by a 13–15 cycle amplification using a uracil-insensitive polymerase (EpiMark hot start Taq polymerase, NEB, Cat #M0490S). The amplified library products were separated on a 2% agarose gel from which library fragments in the 250–500 bp range were excised (QIAquick gel extraction kit, Cat# 28704, QIAGEN) and AMPure purified (Cat# A63881, Beckman Coulter). Gel staining was done with SYBR Safe (Life Technologies) and visualized on a blue light transilluminator (Life Technologies) to avoid UV damage to the DNA. The final libraries were quantified by the RNA concentration was determined on Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States), sized on the Agilent TapeStation (DNA5000 Screen Tape) and by qPCR with the Kapa SYBR Fast qPCR reagents (Cat# KK4824, Kapa Biosystems) with monitoring on an ABI7900HT real-time PCR system (LifeTechnologies).

Methylation calling was performed with CSCALL and the differential methylation analysis was performed using the MCOMP program, which is part of the MOABS package. Cytosine sites with at least a 10x read coverage in at least two out of the four replicates were included in downstream analyses. Methylated cytosine sites for which the p-value of the difference between test and control methylation rates was below 0.01 were considered differentially methylated cytosines (DmCs). In addition, DmCs with a methylation difference > 0 were classified as hypermethylated whereas those < 0 were classified as hypomethylated. DmCs were also categorized based on the characteristics of their genomic locations including the gene body (from transcriptional start site to transcriptional termination site), promoter (2 kb upstream of transcriptional start site), and downstream (2 kb downstream of transcriptional termination site). Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were defined following the method described in. Briefly, DMRs were determined by comparing the average methylation levels within a 100 bp window between spaceflight and GCs, and those with statistical significance (p < 0.01) were used in the analysis.

Transcripts showing at least a twofold change (−1 ≤ log2 FC ≥ 1) with an FDR value of < 0.05 were identified as DEGs. PCAs of each type of tissue were performed individually, as leaves and roots have widely different patterns of gene expression. The PCA plots of leaves and roots showed different grouping of elp2-5 samples along with the components compared to Col-0 and met1-7 (Supplementary File 2 and Supplementary Figure 1). In the comparison of spaceflight to ground leaves, Col-0 had a total of 207 (123 up-regulated and 84 down-regulated) DEGs, elp2-5 had 36 (26 up-regulated and 10 down-regulated) DEGs, and met1-7 had 226 (160 up-regulated and 66 down-regulated) DEGs (Figure 7A). In roots, a total of 147 (28 up-regulated and 119 down-regulated), 120 (50 up-regulated and 70 down-regulated), and 47 (39 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated) DEGs were found in Col-0, elp2-5, and met1-7, respectively (Figure 7B). Only a few DEGs overlapped between the genotypes in both leaf and root tissues (Figures 7C,D). In leaves, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and met1-7, whereas, in roots, the majority of DEGs were unique to Col-0 and elp2-5 (Figures 7C,D). The patterns of DEGs in all three genotypes were distinctly organ-specific, and of the 436 DEGs in leaves and 288 in roots, only 35 DEGs were common to both sets (Figure 7E). Although there were overall fewer root-specific DEGs, a greater proportion of the root DEGs were also differentially methylated in response to spaceflight compared to the DEGs of leaves. In roots, 82% of the DEGs also exhibited DmCs, whereas in leaves, 31% of the DEGs also mapped to DmCs (Figure 7F and Supplementary File 5).",

However, such correlations do not establish a functional connection between DNA methylation and physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Therefore, two methylation mutant lines, each deficient in separate and distinct functions that affect methylation, were grown on the ISS to assess their response to spaceflight compared to that of wild type.

Previous experiments have shown that in the microgravity of spaceflight, plant root growth is altered compared to growth on the ground, yet when presented with directional light, roots generally grow away from the light source and establish a near normal growth pattern, and present a generally healthy-looking morphology. However, the roots of the elp2-5 plants in spaceflight did not set up this typical spaceflight directionality, as the roots did not navigate away from the germinated seed. The total biomass of the elp2-5 plants on orbit was similar to that of the GCs (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, all of the biomass of the elp2-5 spaceflight plants was concentrated into the area very near the seed, which may accelerate the depletion of nutrients in the immediate vicinity of germination. Nutrient depletion stress is also apparent in the elp2-5 spaceflight transcriptome. The leaves of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants appeared to be less expanded, more chlorotic and displayed more reddish pigmentation than the leaves of the GCs (Figure 1C). The elp2-5 mutants generally exhibit over-accumulation of anthocyanin pigments, which can be further exacerbated by stress. This distinct, spaceflight-dependent, morphology for elp2-5 plants suggests that elp2-5 plants are physiologically maladapted to spaceflight. While it has been established that ELP2 has a role in root development (e.g.,) the spaceflight data suggest that ELP2 may also play a role in gravity perception and root navigation. In terrestrial environments, where gravity can impart a tropic force, plants lacking ELP2 have shorter roots but grow reasonably well. However, in the absence of gravity, elp2-5 mutant roots appear to lose the ability to navigate effectively away from the site of the germinating seed.",

This result reinforces the conclusion that changes in overall average genome methylation is not a hallmark of spaceflight adaptation in wild-type plants, as this result was also seen in the spaceflight methylome of Arabidopsis cultivar WS. However, the hypermethylation of the mutant genomes suggested that the respective contributions of MET1 and ELP2 are important to maintaining an appropriate degree of genome-wide methylation in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The degree of DNA methylation within each context in elp2-5 was significantly increased in response to spaceflight in both leaves and roots (Figures 2G,H) compared to the degree of methylation of these mutants with respect to wild type in the GCs. However, there was a distinction between the two mutant lines in the degree and context of methylation in the respective root genomes. The spaceflight elp2-5 root genome was significantly hypermethylated in all contexts (CG, CHG, and CHH) compared to the GCs, whereas only CG methylation was elevated in the spaceflight met1-7 genome (Figures 2D,H,J). Although the contribution of CHG and CHH methylation in Arabidopsis is generally small (about 14%) it is possible that while genome-wide changes in CG methylation does not impact spaceflight root growth morphology, changes in the CHG and CHH context may contribute to the spaceflight phenotype of elp2-5 plants.",

Spaceflight induced more CG methylation across all protein-coding regions (upstream, gene body, and downstream) in met1-7 leaves and only increased methylation in the upstream and downstream regions in roots (Figure 3). Conversely, elp2-5 methylation was increased across all protein-coding regions and methylation contexts only in the roots in response to spaceflight (Figure 3). The substantial increase in CHH methylation in elp2-5 roots (Figures 4A,B) suggests that ELP2 plays a dominant role in governing the spaceflight-associated methylation changes in the roots, specifically in the CHH context.

The profiles of differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes in both elp2-5 and met1-7 were unique compared to wild-type Col-0 (Figures 10, 11 and Supplementary Figure 2). The loss of MET1 and ELP2 each had a substantial influence on the profiles of DEGs and differentially methylated genes in response to the spaceflight environment. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the elp2-5 spaceflight plants indicate that the spaceflight plants are under considerable stress compared to GCs. Almost a third of the genes uniquely induced in the spaceflight elp2-5 leaves are associated with nutrient stress, and most of the rest are genes associated with heat stress, ROS and pathogen responses. These gene classes were also noticeably represented among the elp2-5 spaceflight root DEGs. These gene expression patterns describe a highly stressed response reflecting the compact growth morphology of the spaceflight elp2-5 plants. The types and functions of the genes that are differentially expressed in the met1-7 spaceflight plants suggest that met1-7 plants were better adjusted to spaceflight than the elp2-5 plants. As with the elp2-5 plants, the met1-7 plants present a number of stress-associated DEGs. However, in contrast to the types of genes expressed by spaceflight elp2-5 plants, the DEGs in spaceflight met1-7 plants predominantly functioned in signal transduction, as membrane transporters or transcriptional activators (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary File 6).",

A large proportion of the differentially methylated and expressed genes in leaves were observed in Col-0 (59 out of 207) and met1-7 (72 out of 226), whereas in roots a large proportion of differentially methylated and expressed genes were found in Col-0 (114 out of 147) and elp2-5 (101 out of 120). Only 8% of the leaf DEGs and 12% of the root DEGs overlap between the genotypes, suggesting that unique organ-specific mechanisms were engaged for spaceflight adaptation, with MET1 playing a more important role in leaves and ELP2 having the more important role in roots, in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight.",

In wild-type Col-0 leaves, the hypomethylated DmCs and hypermethylated DmCs were evenly distributed across all contexts and all genic regions (Figure 5A). The association of changes in methylation with gene expression showed an even proportion of positive and negative correlation. In met1-7 leaves, DmCs were predominantly hypermethylated in the CG and CHH contexts of downstream regions, and a larger proportion of positive correlations were observed among DmC-DEGs (Figure 10). In elp2-5 roots, DmCs were primarily hypermethylated in the CHH context across all genic regions, yet a larger proportion of DmC-DEGs showed a negative correlation (Figure 11). These observations are in contrast with other studies that report a strong negative correlation between promoter CG methylation and gene expression levels. Further investigations may clarify the relationship between leaf spaceflight transcript abundance and methylation in different contexts and genic regions. However, 80% of DEGs (across all genotypes) were also differentially methylated in roots. In leaves, that average was only 30% (Figure 7F).

Functional analyses of DmC-DEGs showed sharp contrasts among elp2-5 and met1-7 with the Col-0 wild-type. The mutant elp2-5 line showed differential methylation and expression of gene classes traditionally associated with the spaceflight response and other abiotic stresses, such as metabolic processes and defense, hormone, and hypoxic responses across tissue types (Figure 8E). The mutant met1-7 line, conversely, demonstrated relatively few GO term enrichments, indicating that DmC-DEGs tended to result from largely untargeted changes in methylation (Figure 9E). ELP2 regulates root growth and development, and elp2 loss of function mutants display shorter roots, and this phenotype may be linked to the root-specific involvement of DmC-DEGs associated with ion homeostasis, transport processes, and extracellular localization observed in this study (Figures 1C, 8E). The spaceflight-associated processes that are differentially represented in elp2-5 are also among the primary classes enriched in DmC-DEGs involved in the spaceflight acclimation of Col-0 (Figures 8E, 12).

This correlation strongly suggests that the spaceflight response, though novel, utilizes a range of mechanistic approaches that are typically employed during terrestrial environmental stress.
