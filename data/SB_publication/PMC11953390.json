The current therapeutic options for CKD remain limited in efficacy. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD are of paramount importance. We identified cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) with potential as drug targets from the eQTLGen Consortium database to serve as the exposure. For the outcome, we utilized a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the FinnGen database, which comprised a case group of 11,265 individuals and a control group of 436,208 individuals. MR analysis was employed to investigate druggable genes closely associated with CKD. Subsequently, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted to elucidate the functional roles of these significant genes. Finally, a colocalization analysis was conducted to determine the likelihood that a cis-eQTL for a druggable gene and CKD share a causal variant. The expression of 12 genes was found to be significantly associated with CKD risk, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.05. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicated that these genes are primarily involved in the regulation of MAP kinase activity, regulation of protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation and Oxytocin signaling pathway. The colocalization analysis results suggested that CKD and the TUBB gene may share a causal variant, with a posterior probability (PP.H4) exceeding 80% (TUBB: 97.27%). Compelling statistical evidence indicates that TUBB represents the most promising pharmacological target for the treatment of CKD. This study not only identifies potential therapeutic targets but also offers valuable insights for future drug development in the context of CKD.",

It is defined by a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² body surface area, or urinary albumin excretion equal to or greater than 30 mg/day, or both, sustained for a duration exceeding three months. Historically, the management of CKD primarily focused on delaying renal failure, implementing end-stage dialysis, or pursuing renal transplantation. However, recent advancements in the field have led researchers to explore pharmacological interventions, such as empagliflozin, which has shown promise in decelerating CKD progression and mitigating cardiovascular risks associated with the condition. Despite advancements in medical research, effective treatments for CKD remain elusive. Consequently, the identification and exploration of novel drug targets for CKD treatment are imperative.",

It is essential to note that horizontal pleiotropy should be entirely absent in MR analyses. To identify IVs meeting these criteria, we conducted a rigorous screening of each druggable gene. Initially, we performed association analyses to select SNPs from the cis-eQTL data, ensuring that only SNPs with P-values below the genome-wide significance threshold (5.0 × 10− 8) were considered. Secondly, to mitigate the knock-on disequilibrium effects of these SNPs, we utilized the “TwoSampleMR” package in the R programming language to set the linkage disequilibrium (LD) threshold to R² < 0.1, using data from the 1000 Genomes Project (EUR population) with an aggregation distance of 10,000 kb. In addition, we calculated the proportion of variance explained (R2) and the F statistic to quantify the strength of the tool with the following equations: R2 = 2 × MAF × (1 - MAF) × β2, and F = R2(n-k-1)/ k(1-R2), where “MAF” is the SNP used as the IV secondary allele frequency, “n” is the sample size, “k” is the number of IVs used.

When the IV comprised two or more SNPs, we applied five different methods: inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. We used the IVW method as the primary analysis method because previous studies have shown that the IVW method is more conservative but more robust. To account for multiple testing, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction to identify significant MR analysis results. Additionally, to ensure the robustness of our findings, we employed several methods for sensitivity analyses. Potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q test. Heterogeneity was considered absent if the p-value of the Cochrane Q test exceeded 0.05. Potential pleiotropy between exposure and outcome was examined using MR-Egger regression. Pleiotropy was considered absent if the p-value for the MR-Egger regression intercept was greater than 0.05.",

To assess the pleiotropy of these 16 significant genes, we utilized MR-Egger regression. The intercept p-value for “S100B” was less than 0.05, indicating the presence of horizontal pleiotropy. Conversely, the intercept p-values for the remaining 15 significant genes were greater than 0.05, suggesting no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy for these genes. The potential heterogeneity of IVs was assessed using Cochrane’s Q-test. The results indicated significant heterogeneity for the IVs associated with “C4A,” “C4B,” and “XYLT1,” while no evidence of heterogeneity was found for the other significant genes. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we did not accept the presence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity.

Knowing the chromosomal location of these genes helps identify genetic variations related to diseases, providing important information for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Moreover, chromosomes are carriers of genetic information, and their structure, organization, and evolution are crucial for understanding the functional and evolutionary history of an organism’s genome.

Microtubules (MTs) have been characterized as long, hollow polymers with a diameter of 25 nm and lengths ranging from less than 1 μm to over 100 μm. They were initially described as consisting of approximately 13 linear protofilaments, forming a polymer with a fast-growing positive end (exposed β-tubulin) and a slow-growing negative end (exposed α-tubulin). MTs are integral to the formation of cellular structures and the regulation of cellular functions, such as cell polarity and morphology, chromosome segregation during cell division, and the localization and transport of organelles. Furthermore, MTs facilitate intracellular transport, assemble into larger structures with the aid of auxiliary proteins, and interact with various cell types to establish mature networks. It has been proposed that microtubule-targeting compounds inhibit microtubule polymerization, thereby causing an imbalance in microtubule dynamics. This disruption results in spindle apparatus damage, cell cycle arrest, and ultimately, tumor cell death. Consequently, compounds that target microtubules are capable of inhibiting microtubule polymerization. It is apparent that these compounds can interfere with a range of critical cellular processes. Among the proteins constituting microtubules, β-tubulin is particularly significant. During microtubule polymerization, only the β-tubulin subunit is capable of hydrolyzing GTP following the incorporation of microtubule dimers. This underscores the critical role of TUBB and its encoded β-tubulin proteins in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and human immunity.",

For instance, compounds such as vincristine, vinblastine, and vindesine target the Vinca domain located at the inter-dimer interface between two longitudinally aligned tubulin dimers within the β-tubulin monomer. Additionally, colchicine, benzimidazoles, and combretastatins interact with the colchicine binding sites situated in the deep pocket between αβ-tubulin dimers within β-tubulin monomers. Furthermore, binding to the Taxane site of β-tubulin monomers in the inner lumen of MTs stabilizes the MT lattice. Consequently, MT-stabilizing agents such as paclitaxel and epoxomicin have been developed. Secondly, Maytansine and Spongistatin interact near the Vinca site on the exposed pocket of β-tubulin. Similarly, the compounds Laulimalide and Peloruside target β-tubulin protein pockets oriented towards the exterior of microtubules (MTs). In 2021, the Gatorbulin site was identified, located within the α-tubulin subunit, between α- and β-tubulin, and proximal to the colchicine site. This site functions to form a wedge between two longitudinally aligned MT dimers at the MT terminus. Recently, a novel compound named Cevipabulin has been reported to bind to this pocket. The numerous sites of targeted drug development, whether currently known or unknown, associated with TUBB present substantial opportunities for TUBB to be considered a potential drug target in CKD.",

            "text": "As discussed above, TUBB gene expression produces β - tubulin, which is involved in the composition of microtubules. Meanwhile, microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) interact with microtubules, such as participating in microtubule binding, regulating microtubule stability, polymerization, and depolymerization processes. They interact with each other and jointly participate in maintaining the cytoskeleton structure and cell morphology within the cell. This is similar to our GO/KEGG enrichment analysis results, where in the Biological process module, these genes are mainly enriched in the regulation of MAP kinase activity. The relationship between GTPase activating protein (GAP) and microtubule proteins is close, and the microtubule network formed by the β - microtubule protein encoded by the TUBB gene can serve as a transport track and localization platform for signaling molecules. This is similar to the results of our KEGG enrichment analysis, which mainly concentrates on the Gap junction.",

            "text": "These β-tubulin protein-based microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) play a crucial role in tumor treatment by disrupting microtubule homeostasis within the spindle apparatus, thereby activating mitotic checkpoints. This disruption arrests cells at the mid-stage of mitosis, ultimately leading to cell death through apoptosis. Additionally, these agents have demonstrated efficacy against parasites. Recent research has indicated that TUBB, a microtubule protein, may play a role in the pathological mechanisms underlying various renal diseases, including tubulointerstitial disease and renal fibrosis. For instance, Sang et al. demonstrated that the inhibition of microtubule dynamics hinders the repair of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and promotes renal fibrosis. Additionally, Yang et al. identified β-tubulin as a serum marker for renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that this type of carcinoma is associated with elevated TUBB expression. Although there is a paucity of comprehensive studies specifically addressing the relationship between TUBB and CKD, emerging research has increasingly concentrated on the interplay between MTs and their associated proteins in the context of CKD. A cross-sectional study has identified β-tubulin as a potential biomarker for cognitive impairment in CKD patients. Additionally, recent findings indicate that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) mini-nuclear host gene 12 exacerbates inflammation and apoptosis while inhibiting autophagy in acute kidney injury by upregulating TUBB expression. This finding aligns with the results of our analysis, which demonstrated a positive association between TUBB expression and CKD risk. Consequently, we propose that TUBB represents a potential therapeutic target for CKD, meriting further in-depth investigation into its underlying mechanisms. Apart from TUBB, several other potential targets were identified (Fig. 3). Although these additional significant genes were not corroborated by colocalization analysis, the important value of them cannot be entirely dismissed, and they continue to present a broad spectrum of possibilities for CKD drug development.",

            "text": "Despite our rigorous analytical approach, which included the exclusion of results exhibiting heterogeneity and pleiotropy (including horizontal pleiotropy), our study has certain limitations. Firstly, our findings are based on statistical extrapolation, which may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where other confounding factors may interfere. Consequently, our results cannot entirely substitute for basic or clinical trials, nor can they guarantee the actual efficacy of the drug. Therefore, further basic and clinical research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms and effects of TUBB on CKD. Besides, the current analysis is ethnically constrained, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to other populations. Importantly, our study offers significant insights and guidance for advancing research on identifying drug targets for CKD.",
