This study evaluated C57BL/6 mice on Day 40 after total-body 56Fe26+ irradiation at 0, 1, 2 and 3 gray (Gy). Radiation consistently increased thymus mass (one-way ANOVA: P < 0.005); spleen, liver and lung masses were similar among all groups. In the blood, there was no radiation effect on the white blood cell (WBC) count or major leukocyte types. However, the red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit and the CD8+ T cytotoxic (Tc) cell count and percentage all decreased, while both the CD4:CD8 (Th:Tc) cell ratio and spontaneous blastogenesis increased, in one or more irradiated groups compared with unirradiated controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). In contrast, splenic WBC, lymphocyte, B cell and T helper (Th) counts, %B cells and the CD4:CD8 ratio were all significantly elevated, while Tc percentages decreased, in one or more of the irradiated groups compared with controls (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Although there were trends for minor, radiation-induced increases in %CD11b+ granulocytes in the spleen, cells double-labeled with adhesion markers (CD11b+CD54+, CD11b+CD62E+) were normal. Splenocyte spontaneous blastogenesis and that induced by mitogens (PHA, ConA, LPS) was equivalent to normal. In bone marrow, the percentage of cells expressing stem cell markers, Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1, were low in one or more of the irradiated groups (P < 0.05 vs 0 Gy). Collectively, the data indicate that significant immunological abnormalities still exist more than a month after 56Fe irradiation and that there are differences dependent upon body compartment.",

Since current guidelines of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) apply only to low Earth orbit (LEO) missions, the need for data on radiation effects beyond LEO is increasing as space exploration proceeds. Exposure to relatively high doses and various forms of radiation during spaceflight beyond LEO is inevitable. Sources include galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), which originates from outside our solar system, and solar particle events (SPEs), which appear sporadically and are unpredictable.",

The great majority of cosmic radiation is composed of protons (86%) and helium ions (11%). High-charge and high-energy (HZE) ions represent a very small percentage of the various forms of space radiation, i.e. ~1%. Of these, 56Fe is considered to be the most important because of its high linear energy transfer (LET). Although many body systems could be adversely affected, the immune system is especially radiosensitive. Immune depression and/or dysfunction could lead to overwhelming infection and other pathologies, which could increase the risk of mission failure and possibly decrease quality of life after return to Earth. Potential immunological aberrations associated with radiation and other stressors in the spaceflight environment (e.g. alterations in gravitational force, hypoxia and psychological stress of confinement) have been summarized relatively recently.",

In addition, ground-based studies that simulate space radiation and other stressors have shown significant changes in immune parameters compared with controls. The great majority of the space radiation-associated studies have used photons (γ-rays, X-rays) and to a lesser extent also protons. Overall, there is much less knowledge regarding immune effects after exposure to HZE ions. This is important to note because different forms of radiation do not always result in identical outcomes.",

The current study was one of a series done with 56Fe radiation in murine models in order to confirm and extend our previous findings. In those studies, we found drastic reductions in virtually all characterized immune parameters, with associated changes in ex vivo function, four days post-irradiation. While most of the population recovered by Day 110–113, there were still some strain-dependent changes in T and B cell populations 30 days post-exposure. Those findings are extensively compared with the present data in the discussion. The major goal here was to determine the effect of whole-body 56Fe26+ irradiation on leukocyte distribution and function at a relatively long time-point after exposure.",

After an acclimatization period of ~1 week, non-anesthetized animals were placed individually into well-aerated polystyrene boxes (volume 3 × 3 × 6 cm) and were exposed to iron ions (56Fe, Z = 26, 1 GeV/nucleon, LET = 148.2 keV/μm track average) using the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS). Additional beam characteristics can be found elsewhere. The radiation was delivered in a single fraction to total doses of 1, 2 and 3 Gy at a dose rate of ~1 Gy/min at beam entry. A 0 Gy control group was treated in an identical manner but without irradiation. Several days later the animals were shipped to LLU. On Day 40 after irradiation, the mice were weighed and then rapidly euthanized in 100% CO2 ",

The thymus is the primary site for T cell maturation and plays an important role in the induction of tolerance to self-antigens. Although this organ is most important early in life, it can participate in T cell regeneration under dire circumstances in adults, thus resulting in increased thymic mass. In a previous study using similar doses of 56Fe radiation, we found that thymus and spleen (but not body, liver or lung) masses were significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner on Day 4.",

There was, however, a strong trend for low monocyte numbers in the 3 Gy group. This was somewhat surprising since monocytes, i.e. important members of the innate immune system, have long been known to be more radioresistant than lymphocytes and granulocytes. A possible reason is that the monocytes may have migrated out of the blood circulation and become localized at a site of injury/inflammation. In a previous study, we found 56Fe dose-dependent decreases in blood WBCs and in all three major leukocyte types on Day 4 post-irradiation, followed by complete recovery in cell numbers by Day 113; monocyte–macrophage percentages, however, were significantly decreased in both blood and spleen. Others have also noted great reduction in WBCs and the three major leukocyte types in mice during 4, 7 and 14 days after 3 Gy 56Fe irradiation. This latter study also demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of androstenediol 30 min after exposure could significantly mitigate the detrimental effect.",

Since hematopoietic stem cells are precursors to RBCs (as well as WBCs), our bone marrow data showing low levels of cells with hematopoietic stem cell markers are consistent with these findings. Significant depression in all three of these parameters has also been noted on Day 4 after iron ion irradiation, with return to normal by Day 113. In a comparison of 2 Gy iron, carbon and proton radiation, the 56Fe-irradiated group had the lowest RBC count, HGB and HCT at 110 days post-exposure, although statistical significance was not always obtained. Loss in RBC mass, due at least partly to destruction of newly released RBCs, and anemia have been consistently associated with space missions for many years. As recently reviewed, the underlying mechanisms appear to be at least partly linked to neocytolysis under microgravity. Based on these and other reports, the addition of particle radiation exposure, especially during extended deep-space missions, could further exacerbate anemia in astronauts.",

Data on lymphocyte subpopulations in the blood showed only a trend for a radiation effect on T cells (number and percentage) and B cells (percentage). Further analysis showed significant radiation-induced decreases in CD8+ Tc cell counts and percentages, but no differences among groups in the CD4+ Th cells. These findings led to a greatly increased CD4:CD8 ratio.

Since CD8+ Tc lymphocytes kill cells that are virally infected or transformed to a potentially malignant phenotype, low numbers certainly could compromise immune resistance during space missions.
