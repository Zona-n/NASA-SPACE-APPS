            "text": "The goal of the present study was to characterize acute oxidative damage in ocular structure and retinal function after exposure to spaceflight, and to evaluate the efficacy of an antioxidant in reducing spaceflight-induced changes in the retina. Ten-week-old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS on Space-X 24 over 35 days, and returned to Earth alive. The mice received a weekly injection of a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE), before launch and during their stay onboard the ISS. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Before the launch, intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured using a handheld tonometer and retinal function was evaluated using electroretinogram (ERG). ERG signals were recorded when the mouse eye was under dark-adapted conditions in response to ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes. Within 20 h after splashdown, IOP and ERG assessments were repeated before euthanasia. There were significant increases in body weight for habitat control groups post-flight compared to pre-flight measurements. However, the body weights were similar among flight groups before launch and after splashdown. The IOP measurements were similar between pre- and post-flight groups with no significant differences between BuOE-treated and saline controls. Immunofluorescence evaluation showed increases in retinal oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death after spaceflight. BuOE treatment significantly decreased the level of the oxidative stress biomarker. ERG data showed that the average amplitudes of the a- and b-wave were significantly decreased (39% and 32% by spaceflight, respectively) compared to that of habitat ground controls. These data indicate that spaceflight conditions induce oxidative stress in the retina, which may lead to photoreceptor cell damage and retinal function impairment.",

However, practical application has been somewhat disappointing due to complications such as short half-lives, low reaction rate constants, lack of cellular uptake, and hypersensitivity reactions. Metal-containing catalytic antioxidants have emerged as especially promising. Of these, redox-active metalloporphyrins possess distinct antioxidant properties, including scavenging O2−, H2O2, and lipid peroxides that mediate cellular and tissue damage. These compounds have proven efficacious in numerous in vivo animal models of disease in reducing oxidative stress. Furthermore, in previous studies, we documented the protective effects of a redox-active metalloporphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP) to both photoreceptors and retinal capillaries from radiation damage. ",

This indicates that a 35-day space mission may have a limited impact on irreversible IOP changes pathologically. One possible explanation is that IOP is a transient and time-sensitive parameter. Changes can happen within seconds to minutes. Due to logistical limitations, we were unable to measure IOP until 20 h after splashdown, and elevations in this readout may not have been detectable. Studies have shown that IOP fluctuates considerably with time, body postural change, venous pressure changes, and stress levels. Further evaluation of IOP during spaceflight or longer time sustained microgravity conditions will be required.",

            "text": "The ERG is an electrical potential generated in response to light stimulation of the retina and recorded from the corneal surface of the eye. ERG technology is a powerful approach in assessing retina function and ganglion cell activity. The mouse retina expresses a short wavelength-sensitive and a middle/long wavelength-sensitive opsin (S- and M-opsin), whereby the S-cones are responsive to ultraviolet (UV) peak at 360 nm, and M-cones and rods are responsive to the green light at peak 504 nm. Previous studies suggested that the mouse cone system predominantly expresses S-opsin. Since S-opsin sensitivity drops significantly at wavelengths longer than 425 nm, only UV light is efficient in stimulating mouse S-opsin. In our present study, we focused on probing S-cone-mediated properties using UV light stimulation. Despite the small percentage of cones in the mouse photoreceptor (5%), cone-mediated responses in mouse ganglion cells are fast and sensitive. Our measurement enables us to quantify cone-mediated response and correlate this with histochemistry evaluation. Cone bipolar pathways are similar to those found in mammals. Therefore, the mouse is potentially a useful model to study cone-mediated vision and for diseases that affects the cone function in humans.",

            "text": "The two ERG components that are most often measured are the a- and b-waves. The a-wave is the first large negative component that reflects the physiological status of photoreceptor rods and cones, followed by the b-wave, which is a cornea-positive amplitude. The b-wave reflects the health of the inner layers of the retina, including the ON bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization in response to increases in light stimulation. Reduced a- and b-wave amplitudes documented in the flight group indicate retinal photoreceptor damage and disturbance of retinal physiological function. These changes are associated with the observed increase in apoptosis in the inner nuclear ganglion cell layer, and a decrease in cone density following spaceflight. Abnormal ERG is recognized in many ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and cone dystrophy. Most human retina disorders are detected by attenuation of amplitude. Studies have also shown a correlation between a decrease in cone-driven function through reductions of dark-adapted ERG b-wave amplitudes and cone photoreceptor loss in a light damage model. Our ERG and histological findings, for the first time, show that spaceflight-induced retinal functional change may occur as a result of photoreceptor damage and cellular death. It is important to characterize and monitor retinal changes that may lead to the progression of retinal disease and retinal degeneration. ",

Studies from the Space Shuttle Mission (STS-135) and Rodent Study-9 (RR-9) also showed a significant increase in apoptotic cell damage in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and INL of the flight mice photoreceptors. Retinal nuclear cell damage causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases. Retinas are more sensitive to environmental damage than other central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Apoptotic cell death is documented in many forms of retinal vascular dysfunction and degeneration. These findings suggest that retinal nuclear and photoreceptor cells play an important role in maintaining the normal structure and function of the retina. Our data revealed significant increases in retinal nuclear/photoreceptor cell death and a trend showing a decrease in cone density by spaceflight. The presence of apoptotic positive cells in this study supports the hypothesis that apoptotic mechanisms are involved in retinal cell death. Further studies will be required to determine whether these effects are reversible or continue to deteriorate over time. ",

Oxidative stress is one of the leading causes of retinal damage and retinal degenerative diseases. Radiation-induced oxidative stress can damage critical cellular structure and biomolecules, resulting in inflammatory responses, cell death, and tissue remodeling. We have shown in our previous studies that spaceflight and space radiation exposures cause oxidative changes in the retina and retinal vasculature. HNE is a secondary product of lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress. This flight study documented increased oxidative damage with 4-HNE staining, a biomarker for lipid peroxidation in cone photoreceptors, retinal INL, and GCL. The correlation between increased oxidative damage in photoreceptors and abnormal ERG recording indicates that spaceflight impacts the retinal structure, physiology and function.

Administration of BuOE had limited effects in attenuating spaceflight-induced retinal functional change assessed by ERG recording, although it was more effective in restoring a-wavet responses than b-wave responses, especially at high flash intensity (Figure 3b). It may be that the beneficial or protective effects of BuOE with the current dosage was not sufficient to significantly ameliorate the harmful spaceflight-induced effects on the retina or that alternative stressors may be directly leading to apoptosis despite reduced oxidative stress. Due to logistic limitations, the compound was injected once a week in orbit. More frequent injections may be required to protect retinal function more effectively. Daily or twice-weekly administration schedules have been reported to have significant protective effects from oxidative damage in other disease models. Free radicals produced in the ocular tissues by the mechanism other than ROS, which include reactive nitrogen species, and reactive carbonyl species, may be equally important in inducing cellular damage in the retina. Another plausible explanation is that spaceflight conditions induced an imbalanced oxidative/antioxidative homeostasis and antioxidant defense enhanced by this redox-active compound may lead to apoptotic pathway regulation and recovery of retinal function at a later time. We plan to evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, apoptotic status, and retinal function parameters at three months following live animal return to Earth, to further assess the ocular tissue re-adaptation process.

This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. The flight mice were subdivided into two groups: a saline control or BuOE-treated group. BuOE at 1 mg/kg (0.2 mL) was administrated subcutaneously 7 days prior to the flight launch and weekly aboard the ISS. After returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule, it took approximately 20 h for the mice to be recovered in the Atlantic Ocean, brought to shore, and transported to the research laboratory at Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida. Upon live return, a subset of mice (8 per group) went through IOP and ERG testing. The rest of the spaceflight mice (5 per group) were then euthanized with intraperitoneal (IP) injections of Ketamine/Xylazine (up to 150 mg/kg Ketamine combined with up to 45 mg/kg Xylazine). Their eyes were removed and prepared for analysis. The left eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 hours, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right eyes were dissected to obtain the retina. The retinas were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Ground control mice were placed into the same housing hardware with environmental parameters used in flight. GC mice were euthanized three days later.

Mice were dark-adapted for at least 3 h prior to obtaining ERG recordings which were performed on the right eyes. Mice were maintained under anesthesia with 1.5–2% Isoflurane through a nose cone and placed on a heated stage during testing to prevent hypothermia throughout the procedure. The pupils were dilated with 1–2 drops of 0.5% tropicamide (Akorn, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) and 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride (Paragon BioTeck, Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) ophthalmic solutions. Hypromellose (Gonak™) ophthalmic demulcent solution (2.5%) (Akorn, Inc.) was topically administered to the eyes for proper contact with the corneal electrode. The Ganzfeld optical head includes three LEDs with 360, 504, and 850 nm wavelengths. It illuminates the eye with near-infrared at 850 nm during alignment of the corneal electrode guided by the Eye-Cockpit ( IDS uEye software version 4.3, IDS Imaging Development Systems Inc., Minato City, Tokyo) camera software. Three electrodes were attached to record the transretinal electrical signals: the Ganzfeld corneal (positive) electrode was made of a gold conducting ring around the objective lens, contact-attached to the cornea, sealing the eye. A reference (negative) electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the head skin positioned midline between the ears, such that the end of the needle was between the eyes. Finally, a ground electrode was inserted subcutaneously through the base of the tail. ERG was recorded according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Following signal baseline stabilization, ERG signals were recorded in response to increasing intensities of 360 nm Ultraviolet monochromatic light flashes (1 ms duration). Ganzfeld uses a Maxwellian view of illumination, which projects single light to the eye pupil illuminating the retina with high divergence. For each mouse, five sweeps of electrical responses were acquired at each intensity flash, with varying stimulus intervals (Table 1). The waveform amplitudes (microvolts) and implicit times (seconds) of a- and b-waves at each flash stimulus were acquired from five averaged sweeps and analyzed using the Labscribe software (LabScribeERG version 3.016800, iWorx systems, Dover, NH, USA). The amplitude of the a-wave represents the photoreceptor layer hyperpolarization (negative) signal and the b-wave represents the inner retinal bipolar cell and Müller cell depolarization (positive) response signal.
