To evaluate this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice to hindlimb unloading (HU). Mice were individually housed at 32 °C (thermoneutral) from 4 weeks of age (rapidly growing) to 16 weeks of age (approaching skeletal maturity). Mice were then randomized into one of 4 groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU and the results analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice had normal cancellous bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in distal femur, lower femur length and total bone area, mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and higher cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra (LV). HU resulted in lower BMC and BMD in total femur, and lower BV/TV in distal femur and LV in both genotypes. Cancellous bone loss in femur in both genotypes was associated with increases in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. In summary, leptin deficiency did not attenuate HU-induced osteopenia in male mice, suggesting that leptin is not required for bone loss induced by unweighting.",

            "text": "The physiological actions of leptin extend beyond energy metabolism and include regulation of skeletal growth and maturation; a detailed review of the effects of leptin on the skeleton can be found in Reid et al. Leptin stimulates endochondral ossification and osteoblast differentiation and activity in long bones of the lower limb, where the hormone also inhibits differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to adipocytes. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice have smaller craniofacial dimensions, shorter long bones and, when evaluated by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), have lower total body and femur bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). Based on microcomputed tomographic (µCT) and histomorphometric analyses, ob/ob mice have bone- and bone compartment-specific alterations in cortical and cancellous bone mass and architecture, and greatly increased levels of marrow adipose tissue (MAT). Whereas, total and cortical bone mass is normal or lower in ob/ob mice, cancellous bone mass, depending upon skeletal site and age, can be lower, normal, or higher. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy reverses skeletal abnormalities in ob/ob mice. While the literature strongly supports an important role of leptin in increasing bone accrual prior to peak bone mass and in maintaining normal bone turnover, the hormone likely has additional, less well characterized, actions on bone metabolism. In this regard, there is conflicting evidence that leptin plays a role in mediating skeletal response to changes in body weight.",

            "text": "Kapur et al. reported leptin signaling to be a negative modulator of bone mechanosensitivity. Specifically, a loading strain of ∼2,500 μϵ, which was insufficient to produce a bone formation response in B6 mice, significantly increased bone formation parameters in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. However, other studies suggest that leptin is required for full expression of positive effects of weight on bone mass. For example, total femur mass is positively associated with body weight in WT mice. Also, mice heterozygous for the ob gene (ob/+ mice) have adipocytes with a reduced capacity to generate leptin but have near normal leptin levels due to compensatory increases in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass. ob/+ mice exhibit an association between body weight and bone mass nearly identical to WT mice. In contrast, weight differences in ob/ob mice have a positive but quantitatively smaller effect on bone mass. Thus, it is possible that leptin is not required for skeletal adaptation to changes in weight but the hormone may enhance the magnitude of response by increasing sensitivity of bone to external loads.",

To test this possibility, we compared the skeletal response of male WT and ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral to hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based model for microgravity. HU unweights the hindlimbs, facilitating investigation of the role of leptin in the skeletal response to changes in weight. The study was performed at thermoneutral because leptin plays an important role in thermoregulation and mild cold stress induced by conventional room temperature housing results in rapid premature cancellous bone loss in mice. Data were analyzed by 2-way analysis of variance to establish the main effects (genotype and skeletal loading status) and their interaction.",

However, contrary to our expectations, the magnitude of HU-induced osteopenia in ob/ob mice in femur, a weight bearing bone, was virtually indistinguishable from that of WT mice.

Indeed, subcutaneous administration of leptin attenuates ovariectomy- and HU-induced bone loss in rats by reducing osteoclast number. On the other hand, several lines of evidence suggest reduced osteoclast activity in ob/ob mice. Specifically, ob/ob mice have low serum levels of CTX, a biochemical marker of global bone resorption. In spite of elevated osteoclast-lined bone perimeter, resorption of declomycin is diminished in femurs of ob/ob mice.

Specifically, declomycin label given at the start of the study was lower after two weeks of HU compared to weight-bearing mice, indicating greater resorption of fluorochrome labeled bone occurred with HU. This association between unloading and label loss is in agreement with previous spaceflight and HU studies in rats. HU for two weeks had no significant effect on body composition in WT or ob/ob mice.

In the present study, osteoblast perimeter and bone formation rate were not reduced in distal femur in WT or ob/ob mice during HU.

Cancellous bone loss occurs in lumbar vertebra in rodents subjected to microgravity and the bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased bone resorption. Femurs experience high levels of ground reaction forces in response to weight bearing, and these forces are abolished by HU. Lumbar vertebrae do not generally bear weight in mice. However, lumbar vertebrae are load bearing and HU alters the orientation of the vertebral column to the gravitational vector, changing the direction of the load. Similar to femur, leptin deficiency did not prevent HU-induced cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra. While there were no genotype-specific differences in magnitude of cancellous bone loss in lumbar vertebra of HU mice, the bone loss in WT mice was due to a combination of decreased trabecular thickness and trabecular number, whereas the bone loss in ob/ob mice was due to decreased trabecular thickness only. Therefore, minor genotype-specific changes in bone microarchitecture accompanied changes in bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebrae following HU.",

However, in spite of gonadal insufficiency, leptin deficiency typically results in a low turnover skeletal phenotype in ob/ob mice of both sexes. The precise role of androgens in mediating the action of leptin on bone is unknown but antagonism of estrogen receptor signaling was largely dispensable for leptin’s actions in female ob/ob mice.

Housing mice at 32 °C (thermoneutral temperature) minimizes resting energy expenditure and prevents premature cancellous bone loss associated with cold stress induced by sub-thermoneutral housing. Water was provided ad libitum to all animals for the duration of study. ob/ob mice were pair-fed to WT mice from 4 to 16 weeks of age to minimize differences in weight gain. At 16 weeks of age, the mice were randomized by body weight into one of four treatment groups (n = 10/group): (1) WT control, (2) WT HU, (3) ob/ob control, and (4) ob/ob HU. Immediately prior to HU, animals were given a declomycin injection (15 mg/kg; sc). The mice were unloaded for 2 weeks as described. In brief, HU mice were placed in a restraint device, where the tail was cleaned with ethanol-soaked gauze and sprayed with a tincture of benzoin. A thin piece of traction tape was looped through a large paper clip, and then pressed along the sides of the mouse’s tail. Filament tape was wrapped around the tail in two locations to secure the traction tape: the base of the tail and 2.5 cm caudal. The paperclip end was looped through the clasp secured on the unloading apparatus. Mice were positioned in a 30° head-down tilt. During unloading, the ob/ob HU group and control groups of both genotypes were pair-fed to the WT HU group. The fluorochrome calcein (15 mg/kg; sc) was administered at 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and terminated using decapitation. Blood was collected from the trunk following decapitation. Serum was stored at −80 °C. Femora and 5th lumbar vertebrae from each mouse were placed in formalin for 24-hour fixation, then stored at 4 °C in 70% ethanol.

When significant interactions were present, t-tests were used to make two-group comparisons. When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. The required conditions for valid use of t-tests and ANOVA were assessed using Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. When the assumption of equal variance was violated, Welch’s two-sample t-test was used for two-group comparisons. When the normality assumption was violated, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for two-group comparisons. Methods for maintaining false discovery rate at 5% were used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data analysis was performed using RStudio version 0.98.1083.",
