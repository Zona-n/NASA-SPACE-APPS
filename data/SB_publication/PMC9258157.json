Our results showed that the presence of K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many other microorganisms it coexists with, notably those from the Pantoea genus. Species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family were often found to be the most beneficial for the survival of other microorganisms in the ISS microbiome. However, K. pneumoniae was found to exhibit parasitic and amensalistic interactions with Aspergillus and Penicillium species, respectively. To prove this metabolic prediction, K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus were co-cultured under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae cells showed parasitic characteristics to the fungus. The electron micrography revealed that the presence of K. pneumoniae compromised the morphology of fungal conidia and degenerated its biofilm-forming structures.",

The metabolic networks underlying the organisms were represented as bipartite graphs, where two groups of nodes represent metabolites and reactions, and directed edges connect substrates to reactions and reactions to products. These networks were used to identify possible metabolic dependencies between different microorganisms. In the second constraint-based approach, microbial growth rates were predicted, individually and in communities, to gauge the nature of their interactions, as we describe in the following sections.

This approach was adopted on the premise that each microorganism is capable of individual growth. For each location at each flight, the minimal medium sets corresponding to each constituent microorganism were pooled together to form a consolidated medium. Additionally, a base set of co-factors and coenzymes were added to each of these sets. The same medium was used for both the graph-based and constraint-based analyses.

Since A. niger is not a pathogenic bacterium, we extensively characterized an ISS isolated A. fumigatus, a BSL-2 bacterium, to understand the detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae. The scanning electron micrographs confirmed the parasitic effect of K. pneumoniae over A. fumigatus (Fig. 7). Under normal gravity conditions, A. fumigatus was found to be healthy where conidiophore holding vesicle with healthy metulae and phialides harboring conidia were noticed (Fig. 7A), whereas simulated microgravity affected the phialides structure (Fig. 7C) and subsequently conidia-forming cells were not clearly visible. When K. pneumoniae was co-cultured with the fungus, under normal gravity conditions, the bacterial cells (artificially colored in red) were shown to destroy the conidia-forming cells and also partially degraded metulae and phialides (Fig. 7B).",

When co-cultured, the hyphae of A. fumigatus appeared to be healthy when grown under normal gravity (Fig. 7B) and mostly dead when exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D). The number of conidia were also less and on top of the conidia-forming cells the fungal morphological architecture changed. These changes were more obvious in microcosm where both K. pneumoniae and A. fumigatus were co-cultured and exposed to the simulated microgravity (Fig. 7D) than in the setup that were not exposed to simulated microgravity (Fig. 7B).

Thus, statistical analysis was not possible using the SEM approach. This visualization approach demonstrates that K. pneumoniae in combination with simulated microgravity negatively influenced the growth of the fungi. Both these bacterial and fungal strains were isolated from ISS and potential detrimental effect of K. pneumoniae as predicted by the metabolic model during this study was experimentally demonstrated, confirming the degeneration of A. fumigatus morphological architecture.

Unlike in Flight 3, K. pneumoniae reads were retrieved sparingly in Flight 1 (Cupola and WHC) and Flight 2 (Zero-G Stowage Rack).

This is corroborated by earlier findings that K. pneumoniae can inhibit fungal conidia germination and hyphal growth, as well as biofilm formation of Aspergillus species. Recent reports documented that K. pneumoniae shifted to a pathogenic state, potentially leading to septic infections when cooccurred with A. fumigatus in immunocompromised individuals. In addition, this study shows that K. pneumoniae cells prevented germination of conidia and hyphal development of the fungi. It has been further shown that K. pneumoniae bacterial cells induced the fungal cell wall stress response mechanisms and suppressed the filamentous growth of fungi. The simple in silico metabolic model of this study predicted the antagonistic (parasitic) metabolic interaction between K. pneumoniae and A. niger (Fig. 6B), which further enabled to validate parasitism in vivo, using the strains isolated from the ISS. However, this experimental evidence might not be enough to fully prove the metabolic prediction. Additional positive and negative controls are necessary, which would further improve the evidence of antagonistic metabolic interaction predicted during this study. Furthermore, quantitative measurements of K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus growth are needed to validate the computational prediction of this study and warrants further study.",

First, the metabolic models used in the study are automated reconstructions, which despite gap-filling, could potentially contain gaps and blocked reactions and need to be curated. Nevertheless, such automated reconstructions are being widely used in many studies as they serve as useful predictive tools and representations of the metabolism of microorganisms. Secondly, wherever it is applicable, genomes generated from the cultured ISS microorganisms were utilized. Conversely, when strains were not isolated from the ISS environment, and thus, genomes were not available, the reference genomes of the corresponding type strains were used. However, reference genomes provide a useful perspective of an organism’s metabolic capabilities and have also been used in many other studies that incorporate metabolic models. In the absence of exact estimates of environmental metabolites, we posited that the environment had at least the minimal set of metabolites necessary for a given organism to survive, and also included additional cofactors and coenzymes. We assumed that each microorganism is capable of minimal independent growth and thus calculated the minimal medium required to support survival. It is possible that some of the interactions remain conserved, in richer media, although others may disappear, depending on the inherent metabolic capabilities of the organisms.",

Indeed, the graph-theoretic approach does not account for differential importance of reactions, or for example, the increase in growth rate, that may result from potential interactions. This is captured by the complementary constraint-based modeling approaches that were employed, and together, we believe, they provide a more complete picture of the possible interactions between the microbes. As previously highlighted in the ‘Methods’ section as well, there have been previous reports wherein a higher MSI does point towards a possible higher biomass in the community. As reported for Candida albicans, in addition to the genome-scale metabolic model, refining the model using phenotypic microarray and other wet-lab confirmation are needed. Yet, it is highly useful and offers valuable insights into the potential microbial interactions in the community and well complements the constraint-based methods. Of course, it is important to emphasize that our computational methodology studies microbes through a metabolic lens only, and in reality, other interactions may be plausible. Nevertheless, metabolic interactions have been previously shown to be important drivers of community structure and microbial interactions. Importantly, this study offers a first glimpse into the metabolic interactions of the ISS microbiome, upon which several hypotheses can be formulated for future experimental design.",

Our results point towards key dependencies of microorganisms in various locations on the ISS and can pave the way for possible interventions that may rely on targeted disinfection of surfaces aboard the ISS. Our approach also underscores the importance of complementary modeling approaches in dissecting a fairly complex microbiome and understanding various possible interactions.
