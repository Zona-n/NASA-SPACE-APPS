We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein–protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.",

By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction. These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response. For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion.",

The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain. Interestingly, while some PERKs like BnPERK1 and AtPERK4 locate on the plasma membrane, AtPERK13 has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed in BnPERK1 and AtPERK4.",

However, some AtPERK genes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such as AtPERK1, which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation of PERKs in response to different stress conditions. For example, the expression of TaPERKs in wheat and GhPERKs in cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity. In A. thaliana, AtPERK13 has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role of PERKs in maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation. In rice, the PERK gene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability of PERKs to diverse environmental cues. Additionally, PERKs have been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression of TaPERKs is influenced by fungal pathogens, and BnPERK1 has been shown to respond to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. In summary, PERKs are versatile players in response to various stresses.",

This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors, B. rapa (AA = 20) and B. oleracea (CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago.

For example, BnPERK03A1 showed highly specific but relatively low expression in the sepal, and BnPERK15A3 specifically expressed in the leaf and silique. Moreover, 18 orthologous genes of AtPERK5, AtPERK6, AtPERK7, and AtPERK12 in B. napus were highly expressed in pollen. BnPERK15C2, which encoded the shortest protein, was not expressed in any tissues, suggesting a potential loss of function.

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested that receptor-like kinases (RLKs) including PERKs are involved in plant–pathogen interactions and immune responses. Analysis of cis-elements and expression profiles suggested that BnPERKs may act as novel sensors for various stresses, particularly plant pathogen infections. Protein–protein interaction network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant disease response. The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant–pathogen interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling pathways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls affected disease resistance, it is possible that BnPERKs detect these alterations and initiate responses to maintain cell wall integrity. The membrane localization of BnPERKs suggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell’s surface. Upon activation by cell wall components, BnPERKs likely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways. Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling components of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses. Despite these insights, the exact role of BnPERKs in plant immunity remains largely unknown, and their interactions with RLKs or coreceptors remain largely unexplored.",

            "text": "Clubroot disease, caused by the obligate parasite P. brassicae, poses a significant threat to Brassicaceae plants. The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a carbon source for colonization. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream signaling components and their regulation in response to P. brassicae infection are not yet clear. The PERK gene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection or modulating defense-related signaling pathways. Given the role of PERKs in disease response, the involvement of the PERK gene family in B. napus in clubroot disease was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation of BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, BnPERK14A1, and BnPERK06C2 upon P. brassicae infection suggests their putative roles in clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result in B. napus, the expression of AtPERK9 was also downregulated in response to P. brassicae. The perk9 mutant was used for clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 in the disease resistance. Pathogenesis-related proteins including enzymes like β-1,3-glucanase (PR2) and thionins (PR5), which have antimicrobial activity and are involved in the basal immune response. The RBOHD (Respiratory burst oxidase homolog D) gene is crucial in generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of the plant immune system. The increased expression of these genes suggested that the knockout of AtPERK9 triggered the basal immune response, resulting in increased disease resistance in perk9. The induction of PR2 and RBOHD in both Col-0 and perk9 after inoculation suggested that basal immune response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response to P. brassicae infection. However, the exact roles of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 need further function study. The predicted interaction proteins associated with these pathways implied their roles in mediating the interaction between B. napus and P. brassicae, providing targets for further functional characterization.",
