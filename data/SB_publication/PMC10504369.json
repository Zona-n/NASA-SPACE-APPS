Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.",

A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity.",

In healthy adults, MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage. In the context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate specific signaling pathways in skeletal muscles related to inflammation, protein synthesis, and autophagy. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and differentiation capacities. In terms of effects of radiation exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inflammatory signaling. Studies using chronic, lower dose, whole-body irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little effect on differentiative capacity. Higher dose leg-specific radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myofiber sizes and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well, suggesting that level and duration of exposure could have different effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors.",

Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as cellular proliferation clocks. Telomere attrition leads to loss of cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Shortened telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ compartments, including brain, spleen, small intestine, and reproductive system, among others. Additionally, it has been reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human fibroblasts appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response following X-ray irradiation. Increased DNA damage found at telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper cellular functionality.",

In our experimental design, mice were divided into four different cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspension (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined (HLS + IR); (Fig. 1). More specifically, wildtype mice were pre-exposed to 2 Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a 3-week time course, mice were sacrificed, and various tissue weight metrics were obtained. We found that at the study endpoint, mouse whole-body weights were similar for all groups (Fig. 2a), demonstrating that HLS did not detrimentally affect mouse appetite. This finding is especially important, since hindlimb unloading has been used as method to study behavioral despair and depression, and appetite changes, if any, could have influenced our study results.",

However, gastrocnemius muscles did exhibit a significant muscle atrophy in HLS and HLS + IR groups (Fig. 2b, 2e; p = 0.0490, p = 0.0138, respectively), leading us to focus on this muscle for the duration of the study. To confirm that gastrocnemius weight reductions affected muscle fibers, muscles were cryosectioned and stained with fluorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which labels extracellular matrix regions. We observed significantly smaller fiber sizes in both HLS and HLS + IR groups, relative to control and IR groups (Fig. 2f, g; p < 0.0001, p = 0.0399, respectively), further validating the muscle atrophy effect.

However, telomere lengths in muscle cells were not measured. Using a HLS + IR spaceflight-mimicking system, we wished to query the effects of telomere length on several skeletal muscle-resident cell types. First, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH staining of telomeres on gastrocnemius cryosections. With this method, relative telomere length was determined by intensity measurements of a fluorescently labeled telomeric peptide nucleic acid probe, normalized to the fluorescence intensity staining of the entire nucleus by DAPI staining. Cells of interest were identified by additional immunostaining to mark desired cells and/or the cellular positions within the muscle. We first queried telomere length in MuSCs, defined as VCAM+ cells that appear in the satellite cell position (Fig. 3a). Quantification of telomere length revealed no changes between control, HLS, or IR MuSCs (Fig. 3b). However, when HLS + IR MuSC telomeres were assessed, we found significant telomere lengthening, as compared to all other groups (Fig. 3b, p < 0.0001). To evaluate the cellular consequences of these alterations, we evaluated MuSC populations and properties. We first assessed whether there were changes in MuSC numbers in atrophied muscles, as had been suggested previously. Gastrocnemius cryosections were stained with the MuSC marker, Pax7, and total number of positively stained cells per unit area was queried. We found no changes in MuSC numbers between control vs IR, and control vs HLS + IR treated groups, while a significant increase in MuSC numbers was observed in the control vs HLS only group (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b; p < 0.0001). While these findings are interesting and unexpected, they did not correlate with the observed changes in telomere length of the HLS + IR group. To exclude other cellular defects associated with telomere length, we also investigated whether MuSCs were undergoing senescence in response to our experimental manipulations. To interrogate the level of senescence in skeletal muscles in our study, gastrocnemius cryosections were stained for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. We found no correlation between positively stained regions and cells within the satellite cell position (Supplementary Fig. 3). These findings make senescence unlikely as an influencing factor of telomere length modulation in HLS + IR MuSCs.",

Similar to what was found for MuSCs, myonuclei also displayed increased telomere length in HLS + IR gastrocnemius muscles, when compared with control, HLS, or IR gastrocnemius myofiber myonuclei (Fig. 3c; p < 0.0001).

Since our data demonstrated telomere lengthening in HLS + IR MuSCs, we next sought to determine whether telomere length in these cells also shortened following a recovery period, where mice were returned to conventional mobility. To assess this possibility, HLS + IR mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks, with unrestricted movement and normal muscle loading. For this arm of the study, control, HLS + IR, and recovery groups were compared (Fig. 5a). First, we assessed normalized organ weights and found no significant changes to normalized spleen weights (Supplementary Fig. 4a) and kidney weights (Supplementary Fig. 4b) between the groups. Interestingly, testes weights also trended higher in recovered animals, but they remained significantly smaller when compared to control weights (Supplementary Fig. 4c; p < 0.0001). Together, these data confirm that the recovery did not interfere with general organ mass. In assessing the effects of recovery on skeletal muscles, we observed that gastrocnemius muscles of recovered mice were larger than HLS + IR mice and were of similar size to controls (Fig. 5b; p = 0.9927), demonstrating that 2 weeks post-unloading is sufficient to regain normal skeletal muscle size. To evaluate telomere length alterations in the recovered muscles, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH in the gastrocnemius-derived MuSC populations and myonuclei between the experimental groups. Surprisingly, we did not observe telomere shortening in the recovery MuSCs, but instead they retained elongated telomere length and continued to increase even further, relative to the HLS + IR group (Fig. 5c; p = 0.0186). Similarly, telomere length in myonuclei also remained elongated following recovery (Fig. 5d), which also trended higher but was not significantly different compared with the HLS + IR group (p = 0.4288). To further delineate whether there were differential telomere length changes in muscle cell populations, which may have been buried by the averaging of telomere length analysis, we plotted this dataset as a distribution on a per cell basis (Supplementary Fig. 5). These data show, that unlike what was reported for T cells in the Twins Study, where a proportion of the return to Earth cells exhibited population of critically shortened telomeres, we found few MuSCs with very short telomeres and many more MuSCs with long telomeres. The telomere length distribution of muscle cells is somewhat different from the distributions reported in a follow-up study of blood cells in populations of short and long telomeres, suggesting that different cell types might have different mechanisms of managing telomere length under spaceflight or spaceflight-mimicking conditions. In aggregate, these data demonstrate that hindlimb reloading for the indicated recovery period was not sufficient to shorten telomere length to control levels.",

It has been previously reported that the DNA damage responding proteins, ATRX and DAXX, must be downregulated for ALT to occur.

Interestingly, we observed significant downregulation of both Atrx and Daxx transcripts in HLS + IR muscles, relative control (p = 0.0005, p = 0.0009, respectively; Fig. 6c, d), suggesting that ALT-related pathways are engaged in this model.

A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneficial effects in the development of additional countermeasures or prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens. Recently, a comprehensive NASA study, also commonly referred to as the Twins Study, investigated and compared a multitude of metrics, including physical changes, of an earthbound monozygotic twin astronaut, to his brother, experiencing spaceflight. One reported aspect of this study was an observed effect of telomere lengthening in peripheral blood T cells during spaceflight, which was absent in the grounded twin. Outside of space, telomere length changes have been reported in degenerative diseases, which often coincide with tissue atrophy, including skeletal muscle. However, telomere length alterations in skeletal muscle cells, both from mice and humans, are not correlated with the effects of aging, where sarcopenia, a muscle wasting process, is a hallmark. Although muscle deterioration is a serious problem in astronauts’ health, the effect of gravity changes on telomeres of muscle cells has not been studied. In addition, the impact of the effects of radiation on telomere length are still inconclusive. A study of Chernobyl radiation cleanup workers demonstrated that occupational exposure to ionizing radiation led to telomere lengthening in these workers in peripheral blood leukocytes. Similar effects were reported for atomic bomb survivors, but only those who were exposed to lower doses of radiation, as higher dose radiation exposure led to telomere attrition in peripheral blood T cells. However, studies on telomere length following radiation exposure, specifically focusing on the muscle compartment, are nonexistent. Most importantly, the combined effect of weightlessness-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and cosmic radiation exposure reported during spaceflight led us to query whether these factors can contribute to changes in telomere dynamics in myogenic cells in a ground-based mouse model.",

Using this HLS strategy in mice, we observed ~20% reductions in gastrocnemius muscle, similar to what has been previously reported. Despite this loss of muscle mass, no changes in telomere length in the HLS model alone were evident, suggesting that simulated weightless conditions alone are not sufficient to modify telomere length. To mimic cosmic radiation exposure in spaceflights, we exposed mice to whole-body ionizing radiation by itself or utilized a combined approach of HLS and irradiation. Under these conditions, we found telomere lengthening only in myogenic cell types in the HLS + IR group but IR exposure alone had minimal impact on telomeres. Intriguingly, endothelial cells present in the affected muscles do not exhibit significant telomere length changes in either group, suggesting that telomeres within skeletal muscle cells are more susceptible to telomere length changes in our experimental system. Overall, the telomeres in combined radiation exposure and simulated microgravity conditions demonstrated a synergistic telomere lengthening effect when applied together, specifically in myogenic cells but not in other cells with the muscle architecture.",

In line with this statement, in the Twins Study, the return to ground astronaut demonstrated a rapid shortening of telomere length, within 48 h after landing, to levels below earthbound twin, and telomere length extended but still remained shorter than the earthbound twin, even after 9 months. Similar findings were found in other astronaut studies as well. To query whether telomere shortening occurred within skeletal muscle cells of our experimental design, we implemented a 2-week recovery period, where mechanical loading of hindlimb muscles was reestablished. The longer 2-week endpoint compared to the initial 48 h used in the Twins Study was also chosen due to the fact that skeletal muscles cannot significantly recover from atrophy conditions following 48 h of mechanical loading. In contrast to the overall telomere shortening of T cells in astronaut studies, we found that the telomere length of skeletal muscle cells failed to return to baseline levels, despite the recovery of muscle mass.",

A role for telomerase in spaceflight-induced telomere elongation has been suggested for peripheral T cells. However, telomerase activity measurements in astronaut studies could not be measured midflight, as the activity of TERT in tissue samples was “lost in space”, likely hampered by the harsh conditions the samples experienced before returning to Earth. In the mouse study presented here, TERT expression in skeletal muscles was low and coincided with low telomerase activity in our experimental groups. These findings are in agreement with a prior report that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells and suggest that telomerase has minimal role in telomere elongation in this experimental paradigm. However, it cannot be ruled out that transient telomerase activity in small proportions of myogenic cells contributes to our observed telomere-lengthening phenotype. Our investigation into additional modes of telomere lengthening uncovered preliminary evidence of an alternative lengthening (ALT) mechanism engagement. ALT was originally discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to occur in some human tumors While evidence is mounting that ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in rapidly proliferating tumor cells, its modulation and engagement in quiescent non-cancerous cells has not been explored, particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In quiescent skeletal muscle myogenic cells, we found that there is a substantial downregulation of the chromatin remodeler Atrx and the histone chaperone Daxx in both the HLS + IR and the recovery muscles compared to controls. The biological underpinning of this downregulation in muscles remains unknown. Observed telomere lengthening, in conjunction with low telomerase activity and reduction of Atrx and Daxx expression, are suggestive of the engagement ALT-type mechanisms. In support of our findings, recent evidence has shown telomere lengthening in the blood cells of Mount Everest climbers during different points of peak ascent. Based on gene expression analyses, TERT was downregulated and RAD50 was upregulated, while ALT and telomere maintenance via recombination pathways were enriched as the climbers progressed upwards. These high-altitude studies, in which radiation exposure is higher than sea level, add weight to the validity of our findings of ALT-related pathway engagement over a relatively short time frame.",

Since ALT utilizes some of the same players of homologous recombinational (HR) repair, a DNA double-strand break repair mechanism that is most active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, our findings are unexpected. However, there is substantial evidence that HR can occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and in postmitotic neurons. In addition, HR in general occurs at similar frequencies in ALT proficient and ALT-deficient human cells, which adds an additional level of complexity to the understanding of ALT processes. Thus, it is therefore possible that telomerase-independent lengthening may be occurring in our experimental system, and that reduced expression of Atrx and Daxx supports the plausibility of a mechanism with features of ALT contributing to our observations. Until more details emerge on how molecular signatures associated with ALT are governed in nondividing, non-cancerous tissues, the specific mechanisms controlling telomere lengthening in a cell type-specific manner in our experimental design, or in the environment of space, remain elusive.",

            "text": "Overall, this study examined the relationship between skeletal muscle cells and telomere length dynamics following hindlimb suspension and irradiation. While these findings are not extendable to post-flight measurements of astronauts, the experimental design applied here can be of use for preassessments of space-determined factors that modulate telomere dynamics and skeletal muscle functionality. One limitation of our study is that we only use males. Recent studies have demonstrated no sex difference in adult telomere length in vertebrates, thus including female mice in our study is unlikely to change the interpretation of the mouse results. Yet, studies in humans have revealed differences in telomere length between sexes, depending on the age examined and the methodology used. Thus, subsequent studies should consider telomere differences between sexes, especially given the rise in the number of female astronauts participating in space missions, and other reported differences in additional metrics between the sexes in other spaceflight studies. In any event, the data presented herein demonstrate that a ground-based model may be a useful starting point in elucidating the mechanisms governing telomere elongation dynamics in muscles of astronauts during spaceflight.",

            "text": "Another limitation of this study is the type and dose/dose-rate of radiation exposure and how it relates to astronauts’ occupational exposure. The space radiation environment is comprised of high energy protons and galactic cosmic radiation, including but not limited to electrons, protons, and heavier densely ionizing charged particles. Additionally, radiation sources in space are not constant, and the absorbed dose varies between mice and humans varies, at least for proton radiation. Our experimental outcome in ground-based rodent muscle utilized a single exposure to a single ionizing radiation source, as it was not feasible to reload rodent hindlimbs for possible successive radiation exposures. To ensure radiation exposures were sufficient during our experimental window, we utilized a radiation dose of 2 Gy, which at current standards, is higher than NASA occupational exposures.",

            "text": "A major difference between mice and humans is telomere length, with many mouse strains having ∼8-fold longer telomeres than humans, and they exhibit much faster rates of telomere shortening than humans. This greater telomere reservoir could endow muscle cells in in-bred strains of laboratory mice with a protective effect in spaceflight, but it is equally as possible that telomere changes are more easily studied in rodent models because of their differences compared with humans. Skeletal muscle cell telomere length was not examined in astronaut studies, and muscle biopsies of astronauts in space are rare, as the risk of complications to their health or possibly jeopardizing the missions is too great. Thus, future investigations using animal models in spaceflight would presumably mimic the muscle defects seen in astronauts and would be invaluable. Given the differences in telomere length between typically used research mouse strains and humans, future studies could be further strengthened by utilizing more humanized mice in regard to telomere length, such as the CAST/Ei J strain. After being exposed to the same weightless and cosmic radiation conditions as humans, these mice may be useful to further investigate behavior and function of different cell types in relation to their telomere changes.",

Identifying the cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere lengthening, as well as how ALT-related processes affect spaceflight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future prophylactic therapy of astronauts’ muscles, both during space flights and upon return to Earth.",

In brief, muscle tissue was lysed in 1X CHAPS buffer for 30 minutes on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000×g for 20 min to pellet cell debris and protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay. One hundred twenty-five nanograms of protein lysate was incubated with a telomerase substrate at 30 °C for 30 minutes to allow for telomerase to catalyze the addition of telomere repeats to the substrate. The reactions were then PCR amplified, resolved on a 4–20% TBE polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 30 minutes and visualized by staining with SYBR Green nucleic acid gel stain. Relative telomerase activity was quantified using ImageJ software.",
