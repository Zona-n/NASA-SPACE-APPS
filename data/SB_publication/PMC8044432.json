This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database.

In addition, spaceflight research is decentralized and distributed across numerous laboratories in the United States and abroad. As a result, studies performed in different laboratories often utilize different organisms, strains, cell lines, and experimental procedures. Adding to this complexity are variance in spaceflight factors and/or confounders within each study, such as degree of radiation exposure, experiment duration, CO2 concentration, light cycle, and water availability, all of which can have effects on an organism's health and gene expression profiles during spaceflight. In order to optimize the integration of data from this diverse array of spaceflight experiments, it is paramount that variations in data processing are minimized.",

One of the first steps in this effort is the ability to analyze how experimental factors common to multiple datasets impact molecular signaling. Such meta-analysis can only occur if metadata, data, and processed data are harmonized. As part of this strategy, GeneLab engaged with the scientific community and held its first Analysis Working Group (AWG) workshop in 2018. Spaceflight researchers from universities and organizations across the United States and abroad met to begin the creation of a standardized, consensus data-processing pipeline for one of the most common types of spaceflight datasets: transcription profiling via RNA-sequencing. Scientists at this workshop met to discuss the merits of various bioinformatic software tools for processing RNA-sequencing data and ultimately agreed on a single pipeline of these tools.",

In addition, many of these data in the GeneLab database have not been previously analyzed, as their generation was relatively recent.

STAR must be run in two steps. The first step is to create indexed genome files (Figure 3B). These files are used to assist read mapping and only need to be generated once for each reference genome file. This step requires reference FASTA and GTF files (Table S2). Some datasets include the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in control—a pool of 96 synthetic RNAs with various lengths and GC content covering a 220 concentration range. If ERCC spike-ins were included, the spike-in FASTA and GTF files are appended to the reference FASTA and GTF files, respectively. The second step of STAR mapping is to use the indexed reference genome and the trimmed reads from the preprocessing step in order to map the reads to the genome and the transcriptome (Figure 3C). STAR will also produce genome mapped data, which can optionally be used to find reads that map outside of annotated reference transcripts. STAR mapping output data are in Binary Alignment Map (BAM) format, which has a separate entry for each mapped read and states which transcript each read is mapped to. In order to improve the detection and quantification of splice sites, STAR is run in “two-pass mode.” Here, splice sites are detected in the initial mapping to the reference and used to build a new reference that includes these splice sites. Reads are then re-mapped to this dynamically generated reference to improve the quantification of splice isoforms. Users are provided with these results (as per sample SJ.out files) for further analysis of differential splicing.",

The main reasons for using RSEM are its ability to account for reads that map to multiple transcripts and distinguish gene isoforms. In short-read sequencing experiments it is likely that some number of reads will map to multiple regions in the genome. RSEM computes maximum likelihood abundance estimates to split the read count across multiple genes. Similar to STAR, RSEM is run in two distinct phases (Figure 4A). The first phase uses the reference genome and GTF files (with or without ERCC as appropriate) (Table S2) to prepare indexed genome files (Figure 4B). The second phase uses the indexed files and the mapped reads from STAR to assign counts to each gene (Figure 4C). There are two output files generated for each sample: counts assigned to genes and counts assigned to isoforms. Gene counts are used to calculate differential gene expression. Isoform counts are also generated as an option to look at differential isoform expression but are not used during differential gene expression calculation in the RCP. Once the RSEM count files are generated, the data are used to compute differentially expressed genes. A list of the reference genomes used in the GeneLab pipeline is available in Table S2 . These reference genomes were the most recent releases at the time each STAR and RSEM indexed references were created. Although it is possible to run STAR mapping through the RSEM toolkit, we elected not to do this because the alignment parameters used in this case are from ENCODE's STAR-RSEM pipeline and are not customizable. Thus, we would have been precluded from using the precise mapping parameters agreed to by the GeneLab AWG.",

In addition to splice-awareness, when selecting an aligner the following criteria were also considered: ability to input both single- and paired-end reads, handle strand-specific data, applicability to a variety of different model organisms with both low- and high-complexity genomic regions, efficient runtime and memory usage, ability to identify chimeric reads, high sensitivity, low rate of false discovery, and ability to output both genome and transcriptome alignments.

Because samples from some GeneLab RNA-seq datasets contain ERCC spike-in and others do not, there are two versions of the GeneLab DGE R script, one for datasets with ERCC spike-in (GeneLab_DGE_wERCC.R, Data S1) and one for those without (GeneLab_DGE_noERCC.R, Data S2). Prior to running either script, paths to directories containing the input data and the output data location must be defined. Each script starts by defining the organism used in the study, which should be consistent with the name in the organisms.csv file so that it matches the abbreviations used in the PANTHER database for that organism. Next, the metadata from the ISA.zip file are imported and formatted for use with the DESeq2 package. During metadata formatting, groups for comparison are defined based on experimental factors, and a sample table is created to specify the group to which each sample belongs. Next, a contrasts matrix is generated, which specifies the groups that will be compared during DGE analysis; each group is compared with every other group in a pairwise manner in both directions (i.e. spaceflight versus ground and ground versus spaceflight). This approach provides the user with the results for all possible group comparisons, allowing each user to select the most relevant comparisons for their particular scientific questions. After metadata formatting, the RSEM gene count data files from each sample are listed and re-ordered (to match the order the samples appear in the metadata), then imported with the R package, tximport, and sample names are assigned.

Thus, when selecting samples for downstream analysis, we exercised this flexibility and searched the GeneLab Data Repository for datasets/samples that met a specific set of criteria. These criteria were as follows: (1) datasets that evaluated the same tissue (liver) from the same mouse strain (C57BL/6) and sex (female), (2) only samples derived from animals flown in space and respective ground control samples, (3) studies that used the same preservation protocol (liver samples extracted from frozen carcasses post-mission) and library preparation method (ribo-depletion), and (4) samples that contained ERCC spike-in to evaluate outputs with and without ERCC normalization. Select samples from two GeneLab datasets, GLDS-168 and GLDS-245, met these criteria, and processed data including the Normalized_Counts.csv, differential_expression.csv, ERCC_Normalized_Counts.csv, and the ERCCnorm_differential_expression.csv files from these two datasets were used for downstream analyses.",

GLDS-168 processed data files were subsequently filtered to remove all samples, except spaceflight (FLT) and respective ground control (GC) samples, to meet the second criteria listed above. Lastly, because GLDS-168 contains a set of FLT and GC samples that were spiked with ERCC and another set in which ERCC was not added, the later set of samples were removed to meet the fourth criteria. GLDS-245 contains liver samples from the RR-6 mission, which included a set of animals that were returned to earth alive after ∼30 days of spaceflight and another set of animals that remained in space (aboard the ISS) for a total of ∼60 days before being sacrificed aboard the ISS (note that there were respective control samples for each set of spaceflight animals described). The former set of animals had their livers dissected immediately after euthanasia, whereas livers from the latter set of animals were frozen in situ and dissected from frozen carcasses after return to earth. Thus, only the later (ISS-terminal) set of FLT and respective GC samples met criteria 2 and 3, so the GLDS-245 processed data files were filtered to remove all other samples.

However, the use of normalization according to ERCC spike-ins remains controversial among AWG members, and Munro et al. suggested its usage only for determining limit of detection of ratio (LODR), expression ratio variability, and measurement bias. For this reason, ERCC normalization remains optional in the GeneLab pipeline, and both kinds of DGE outputs are provided in the GeneLab database. In addition, ERCC spike-in could have two other usages. First, it allows us to evaluate whether normalization succeeded in removing systemic bias between libraries by using methods such as Rlog and VST when normalizing the spike-in RNAs along with all other genes. Second, most normalization methods of RNA-seq data assume that most genes are not differentially expressed toward one direction. Comparing spike-in measurements between libraries will help us to estimate the validity of this assumption.",

However, at least six replicates are suggested in order to minimize the false discovery rate (FDR).

GeneLab also accepts data from long read experiments, such as those produced by Pacific Biosciences' (PacBio) single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing and Oxford Nanopore Technologies' (ONT) nanopore sequencing. Long-read data would be processed with similar steps to the RCP but will require tools specifically designed for the intricacies of long-read data, such as reads that contain multiple splice junctions and reads that currently have a higher base-calling error rate. Currently, long-reads are typically used for DNA sequencing and were recently highlighted on board of the ISS using ONT for de novo assembly of the Escherichia coli genome from raw reads. However, even though throughput and accuracy remain far inferior to short-reads, long-reads offer some advantages for RNA-seq as well, with less ambiguity for genes and isoforms detection, much faster mapping, potential identification of genes not yet known from reference genomes, and eventually less bias in DGE.",
