            "text": "Exposure to ionizing radiation can cause rapid mineral loss and increase bone-resorbing osteoclasts within metabolically active, cancellous bone tissue leading to structural deficits. To better understand mechanisms involved in rapid, radiation-induced bone loss, we determined the influence of total body irradiation on expression of select cytokines known both to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and contribute to inflammatory bone disease. Adult (16 week), male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to either 2 Gy gamma rays (137Cs, 0.8 Gy/min) or heavy ions (56Fe, 600MeV, 0.50–1.1 Gy/min); this dose corresponds to either a single fraction of radiotherapy (typical total dose is ≥10 Gy) or accumulates over long-duration interplanetary missions. Serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue were harvested 4 h—7 days later. Gamma irradiation caused a prompt (2.6-fold within 4 h) and persistent (peaking at 4.1-fold within 1 day) rise in the expression of the obligate osteoclastogenic cytokine, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), within marrow cells over controls. Similarly, Rankl expression peaked in marrow cells within 3 days of iron exposure (9.2-fold). Changes in Rankl expression induced by gamma irradiation preceded and overlapped with a rise in expression of other pro-osteoclastic cytokines in marrow (eg, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 increased by 11.9-fold, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased by 1.7-fold over controls). The ratio, Rankl/Opg, in marrow increased by 1.8-fold, a net pro-resorption balance. In the marrow, expression of the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, strongly correlated with expression levels of Nfatc1, Csf1, Tnf, and Rankl. Radiation exposure increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to cancellous bone loss (16% decrement after 1 week). We conclude that total body irradiation (gamma or heavy-ion) caused temporal elevations in the concentrations of specific genes expressed within marrow and mineralized tissue related to bone resorption, including select cytokines that lead to osteoclastogenesis and elevated resorption; this is likely to account for rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture following exposure to ionizing radiation.",

            "text": "During a spaceflight beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere, astronauts are exposed to a complex mixture of ionizing radiation (Durante and Cucinotta), including low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays and protons, as well as more damaging high-LET radiation. Exposure to space radiation is characterized by relatively low doses (≤2 Gy) of ion species due to solar particle events (Shurshakov and others; Parsons and Townsend) or galactic cosmic rays (Zeitlin and others; Hassler and others). Simulated space radiation at these doses causes a rapid net decline in cancellous bone volume to total volume as well as a decrement relative to age-matched controls (Kondo and others; Willey and others). The bone loss is associated with increased osteoclast numbers and resorbing surfaces of osteoclasts lining trabeculae (Hamilton and others; Alwood and others; Kondo and others; Willey and others; Yumoto and others; Lloyd and others). Doses in the range of 1–2 Gy also are relevant to radiotherapy; total therapeutic doses can vary, but total body doses of 10–15 Gy typically are fractionated into single doses of ∼2 Gy, which ultimately can lead to increased fracture incidence (Baxter and others). Exposure to radiation, particularly high-LET particles, has the potential to exacerbate the deleterious effects of musculoskeletal disuse, which occurs during prolonged bed rest or spaceflight (LeBlanc and others; Lang and others; Keyak and others; Alwood and others; Yumoto and others).",

Bone-resorbing osteoclasts are thought to cause the rapid (Kondo and others; Willey and others; Turner and others) cancellous strut losses following simulated space irradiation, leading to loss of microarchitectural integrity (Alwood and others). Radiation exposure transiently and markedly increases the numbers of osteoclasts and the extent of cancellous surfaces covered by osteoclasts. However, the role that receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (Rankl), the principal osteoclastogenic cytokine, plays in concert with other pro-osteoclastic inflammatory cytokines (Kim and others; Takayanagi; Boyce and Xing) and oxidative stress is not fully understood with respect to the cancellous bone loss following radiation exposure (Kondo and others).",

Within 3 days of exposure to radiation, the net bone formation rate to bone surface (BFR/BS) is unaffected (Kondo and others). Although radiation does affect osteoblast function within the first week of exposure, as indicated by an observed increase in mineral apposition rate (MAR), a concomitant reduction in the mineralizing surface yields no net change in the bone formation rate (Kondo and others). Similarly, Willey and others also report increased MAR within the first week after exposure, but subsequently BFR/BS declines by 2 and 3 weeks after exposure to 2 Gy X-ray, while Turner and others reported transient increased bone formation even after very high doses of radiation (6 Gy). Therefore, radiation-induced changes in bone formation are more likely to contribute to later remodeling deficits rather than acute bone loss.",

Furthermore, we investigated the temporal expression of a key antioxidant transcription factor (nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2,-like 2, Nfe2l2), which is responsible for mounting a rapid defense against oxidative challenges (Kobayashi and Yamamoto) and is known to play a role in dampening osteoclastogenesis (Hyeon and others).",

We included a basal group in our experiments showing BV/TV of 25.1%±3.6%, which was not different from the age-matched sham control group. A lower dose of iron (5 cGy) failed to elicit changes in bone structural parameters compared with controls and is therefore below the threshold dose for causing bone loss (data not shown).

In summary, the results show that exposure to either gamma or heavy-ion radiation increased gene expression for the canonical osteoclastogenic factor, Rankl, as well as other pro-osteoclast cytokines (Mcp1, Tnf, Il6); this occurred in both marrow and mineralized tissue. These findings do not distinguish between changes in gene expression levels due to a shift in the cell population expressing osteoclastogenic cytokines, a generally higher level of expression for all the cells, or some combination of both. In fact, after exposure to radiation of sufficient dosage, there are pronounced, if transient, changes in marrow cell viability and increases in marrow macrophages, which are likely to contribute to the generation of new osteoclasts. Therefore, we interpret our results to show that exposure to ionizing radiation increased the tissue concentrations of mRNA levels generally so as to favor osteoclastogenesis.",

In addition, marrow expression of the global antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, showed high correlation with the expression levels of several osteoclast-related genes. These data indicate that the activation of oxidative defenses and of osteoclast formation was temporally associated in response to radiation exposure. Our previous work showed radiation-induced oxidative damage presents later, at 10 days after exposure (Kondo and others). Taken together, our results indicate that Nfe2l2-related antioxidant defense pathways were insufficient to prevent oxidative damage in bone.",

Furthermore, a dose threshold was observed, as 5 cGy iron exposure failed to elicit changes in cytokine gene expression in the marrow or cancellous bone structure (data not shown); these findings provide additional indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that early induction of osteoclastogenic cytokine gene expression by biologically effective doses of radiation leads to cancellous bone loss.",

In young mice, a single dose of 5 or 10 Gy increased Rankl/Opg in whole femora within 3 days (Han and others). Using mice deficient in the antioxidant transcription factor, Nfe2l2, radiation exposure at high dose (20 Gy) increased RNA expression for Rankl in cultured osteoblasts grown ex vivo, but this was not observed in cells from wild-type mice (Rana and others).

In some reports, TNF may act independently of RANKL to stimulate osteoclastogenesis (Kobayashi and others). Our results are consistent with other work showing that in vivo exposure to ionizing radiation leads to rapid, complex, and interrelated sequence of signals constituting an immune-related cytokine response in bone marrow (Schaue and McBride; Willey and others; Schaue and others; Buchwald and Aurora). At a very high dose (10 Gy), which is sufficient to ablate the bone marrow of hematopoietic cells, radiation causes bone loss related to elevated fractalkine expression by vascular endothelial cells, inflammatory cytokines Tnf, interleukin 1 beta, and interferon gamma, and recruitment of preosteoclasts (CD11b) (Han and others). Additionally, the time course of cytokine and resorption-related gene expression shown in this study coincides with that of marrow cell death and repopulation (Otsuka and others; Kondo and others), suggesting a possible relationship between an expanded population of marrow macrophages clearing apoptotic cells and debris after irradiation, the differentiation of macrophages into osteoclasts, and increased resorption activity.",
