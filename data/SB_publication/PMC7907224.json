            "text": "Mechanical loading of the skeleton during normal weight bearing plays an important role in bone accrual and turnover balance. We recently evaluated bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in 5.6-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats subjected to a 4-day spaceflight aboard STS-41. Compared to weight bearing ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction was dramatically lower in animals subjected to microgravity. The effects of spaceflight on the rat skeleton are potentially influenced by factors such as age, duration of flight, strain and sex. To test the generalizability of our initial observation, we evaluated archived proximal femora from two additional spaceflight missions: a 10-day mission (STS-57) with 7.5-week-old male Fisher 344 rats, and a 14-day mission (STS-62) with 12-week-old ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats. Cancellous microarchitecture and cortical thickness were assessed using x-ray microtomography/microcomputed tomography. In male rats, cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume) was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls, but differences were not significant compared to baseline. In ovx female rats, cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to flight controls and baseline, indicating net bone loss. Cortical thickness did not differ among groups in either experiment. In summary, findings from three separate studies support the conclusion that spaceflight results in cancellous osteopenia in femoral head of growing rats.",

Studies to date have investigated the effects of spaceflight on bone accrual and turnover balance at a variety of weight bearing, load bearing, and unloaded skeletal sites in growing rodents.

            "text": "The proximal tibia and distal femur are commonly evaluated following spaceflight. In contrast, the effects of spaceflight on proximal femur is much less commonly reported. Bone changes can occur at many skeletal sites but the greatest loss in astronauts is detected in the lower body and, in particular, the proximal femur. In one of the few studies investigating multiple skeletal compartments, we analyzed gene expression in distal epiphysis, distal metaphysis, diaphysis, and proximal region of the femur following a 14-day spaceflight (STS-58) in growing male rats. Notably, we found that the proximal region of the femur exhibited the largest reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins. Based on this initial observation, we evaluated bone architecture (using μCT) in the proximal region of the femoral head of archived bone specimens from rapidly growing male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41, and observed strikingly lower cancellous bone volume fraction in the flight animals. The cancellous osteopenia was a surprise because of the short duration (4 days) of the spaceflight mission. To determine the generalizability of this finding across sex and strain, we assessed bone microarchitecture in the femoral head in archived bone specimens from two additional spaceflight experiments, STS-57 and STS-62. STS-57 was a 10-day mission performed using growing male Fisher 344 rats and STS-62 was a 14-day mission using growing ovariectomized (ovx) female Fisher 344 rats.",

Consistent with the original observation in male Sprague Dawley rats flown aboard STS-41, spaceflight resulted in osteopenia in the femoral head in male Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-57 and in ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown aboard STS-62. However, the magnitude of response appeared to be smaller in the latter two studies. Compared to ground controls, cancellous bone volume fraction in flight rats was −46% in STS-41, −11% in STS-57 and -16% in STS-62. To address the possibility of error in the initial analysis, a different observer blinded to treatment re-measured the μCT scans of the femoral head in rats flown aboard STS-41. The comparable results of the 2nd analysis excludes measurement error but does not provide additional insight. Based on absence of reduction in longitudinal bone growth, absence of reduction in mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins, and absence of histomorphometric evidence for decreased bone formation at multiple skeletal sites assessed, the most likely explanation for the dramatic osteopenia in femoral head in rats from STS-41 is increased bone resorption. It remains unclear, however, whether the more modest osteopenia in rats flown aboard STS-57 and STS-62 compared to their respective flight controls reflects differences due to strain, age, duration of flight, or other factors. However, it is notable that BV/TV in ovx female rats flown aboard STS-62 was lower than baseline controls, indicating net bone loss contributed to the osteopenia.",

            "text": "There is evidence for location-specific (e.g., appendicular versus axial) and compartment-specific (e.g., cancellous versus cortical) effects of microgravity on bone microarchitecture. Mechanistic inference is challenging because of the limited number of studies and variation in experimental design and endpoints used to evaluate the bone response to spaceflight. Variables in design include age at launch, strain, duration of flight, housing conditions during flight, and interval of time between reloading and necropsy. In general, investigators have had limited access to tissues (often a single bone). As for endpoints, histomorphometric analysis was the principle method available for evaluation of bone architecture during the interval when most spaceflight studies using rats as models were performed (1970s–1990s). In this regard, we have been very fortunate in being able to analyze archived femur, humerus, lumbar vertebra and calvarium from ovx female Fisher 344 rats flown on STS-62. Additionally, we measured dynamic and static histomorphometry in tibia and lumbar vertebra in rats from this flight. This wealth of material allows a more complete description of site-specific effects of spaceflight on the skeleton. Compared to ground-based flight controls, flight animals had lower cancellous bone volume fraction in femur at all sites evaluated (head, distal metaphysis and distal epiphysis) but showed no change in cortical thickness (proximal femur and mid-diaphysis). Additionally, the effects of spaceflight were bone-specific, with cancellous bone loss being detected in femur and lumbar vertebra but not in humerus. Although fewer skeletal sites were reported, differential effects of a 15-day spaceflight on cancellous bone in the femur head (lower BV/TV in flight animals) and cortical bone thickness in the femur neck (no change) were also noted in C57BL/6 J mice.",

Histomorphometric analysis of bones of rats flown on STS-62 suggests differential responses at cortical and cancellous bone sites. Specifically, spaceflight resulted in decreased periosteal bone formation in weight-bearing bone, likely contributing to decreased bone mineral content. Reduced bone formation at the periosteum was associated with lower mRNA levels for bone matrix proteins. Decreased bone formation was also commonly detected in longer duration flights (>7 days) in male rats. In contrast, the effect of spaceflight on bone formation at cancellous sites is less clear. The most detailed analyses to date were performed on rats flown aboard STS-62. In these ovx female animals, cancellous bone loss in tibia and lumbar vertebra in excess of that attributable to ovx resulted from increased bone resorption, as ascertained by fluorochrome label disappearance, with no change in bone formation, as ascertained by static and dynamic bone histomorphometry. Finite element modeling of distal femur in these rats, as well as a theoretical model based on fuzzy decision, suggest that mechanical strain modulates the balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Specifically, the overall rate of bone turnover was influenced by endocrine status but bone loss occurred preferentially at sites experiencing low mechanical strain energies. At the molecular level, expression levels of two cytokines known to increase bone resorption, interleukin-1beta and interferon gamma, were elevated in proximal tibial metaphysis.",

Fractures occur at several locations in the proximal femur, including intertrochanteric region, transcervical neck, subcapital neck, and subtrochanteric region. Fractures occurring through the femoral head, the site investigated in this study, are more typically associated with trauma and are particularly difficult to manage. That being said, traumatic injury would be the likely cause of fracture during a spaceflight mission and a microgravity-induced reduction in bone volume fraction at this site would likely reduce the magnitude of trauma required for fracture.

It is noteworthy that significant bone loss during long duration spaceflight in astronauts occurs in the proximal femur. Thus, future studies performed in skeletally-mature animals should carefully evaluate this clinically relevant site.",
