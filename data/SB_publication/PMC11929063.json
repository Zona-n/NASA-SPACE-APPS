A dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity was detected in FVIII knockout mice at a dose of 1.0 × 1012 TAK-754 capsid particles (CP)/kg or higher. This increase was shown to be in accordance with a dose-dependent decrease in blood loss in a hemostatic efficacy assay. TAK-754 (3.1 × 1012 CP/kg) mediated long-term and stable FVIII expression in immunologically tolerant transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution assessments with a single administration of TAK-754 ranging between 1.9 × 1012 and 5.0 × 1013 CP/kg were conducted in male C57BL/6J mice. The highest TAK-754 dose occurred without TAK-754-related adverse clinical signs. Biodistribution profiling showed predominant detection in the liver with a low occurrence of vector DNA in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed minimal vector integration, with no observations of clonal outgrowth or preferred integrations in genes previously implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma formation within the observation period. These preclinical studies demonstrate a good safety and efficacy profile for TAK-754.",

This lifelong disorder requires treatment with replacement factor concentrates to maintain FVIII levels to control and prevent bleeding episodes. Patients with severe disease can experience recurrent joint and muscle bleeding and may receive regular FVIII infusions to prevent the debilitating effects of arthropathy and to reduce their risk of life-threatening bleeds. Another more recent treatment option is the bispecific antibody emicizumab, which mimics FVIII function by binding FIXa and FX to promote hemostasis.",

This is due to the fact that the expression of FVIII from the introduced functional copy of the F8 transgene into a patient’s liver cells can be readily measured in plasma, and relatively low levels of FVIII are already sufficient to alleviate a severe disease phenotype. For adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, this needs to be accomplished by a truncated, B domain-deleted (BDD) variant of FVIII (BDD-FVIII) because of the restricted packaging capacity of AAV, which is 5 kb at the most, excluding the flanking inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions. Nonetheless, ample preclinical experience has demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, which also leads to improvements in vector design.",

Three years of follow-up data demonstrated a sustained, clinically relevant benefit at doses of 4 × 1013 and 6 × 1013 vg (vector genomes)/kg, but also identified a decline in FVIII expression levels over time, suggesting that this therapy will not be lifelong. Other observations difficult to explain to date are the variability in expression between individuals at a given dose and between participants in phase 1/2 and phase 3. These observations have not been made in conceptually similar clinical hemophilia B gene therapy trials and appear to be associated with the nature of the transgene product, as synthesis of FVIII at high levels in hepatocytes is constrained and prone to trigger an unfolded protein response that could lead to cellular stress.",

While ultimately a cytotoxic T cell response against the capsid protein contributes to this phenomenon, other host immune responses elicited by the inherent immunogenic features of recombinant AAV (rAAV) vectors are likely to be involved. The presence of (an excess of) unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG) motifs in the vg is particularly important in that respect as CpG clusters, which are typically present only in microbials, act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in humans and can trigger an innate immune response. The removal of such CpG clusters from vg is therefore thought to be a key measure for dampening innate immune signals that eventually lead to deleterious adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "Expression levels of endogenous wild-type (WT) FVIII levels are relatively low, and the corresponding coding region exceeds the natural packaging limit for AAV. We addressed this by cloning codon-optimized BDD-F8 open reading frames in an AAV expression cassette designed for high expression levels in human hepatocytes (Figure 1A). A total of 41 codon-optimized ssAAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (sequences 01–41) were produced and screened for potency in FVIII knockout (KO) mice. FVIII KO mice closely reflect the severe hemophilia A phenotype in patients and therefore represent a suitable animal model. Expression was compared to animals receiving the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIwt control vector (sequence wt) harboring the WT F8 nucleotide sequence. The best candidate of this in vivo biopotency screen was sequence (seq) 04, with 79.8% nucleotide sequence identity to the corresponding coding sequences in WT F8 (GenBank: M14113) and 74-fold improved efficacy (Figure 1B). The guanine-cytosine (GC) content of seq04 was 56%, which is substantially higher than that of the WT sequence (44%) and matches the native AAV8 capsid protein coding sequence (Figure S1; Table S1). Moreover, CpG motifs in seq04 were low in number and dispersed over the length of the transgene (Figure S2). This feature should help minimize the immunogenicity risk, as high densities of these DNA motifs can increase immunogenicity by stimulating the innate immune system via the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 in the liver. Despite a vector size of approximately 5.2 kb, the recombinant genome appears as a single homogeneous band following DNA gel analysis (Figure 1C), confirming correct packaging of the slightly oversized genome of ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 (relative to an AAV WT genome of 4.7 kb). The same held true for the other AAV8.BDD-FVIII vectors (data not shown). Overall capsid integrity and purity of the ssAAV8.BDD-FVIIIopt-seq04 preparation was confirmed following SDS PAGE-based size separation and detection of VP1, VP2, and VP3 by silver staining (Figure 1D). Initial yields for the seq04 vector per liter cell culture were about 6-fold higher than for the otherwise identical F8 WT nucleotide sequence vector, indicating that vector production using the F8 lead candidate sequence was actually more efficient, probably due to its GC content matching the GC content of the AAV8 virus (Figure S1).",

Numerous comparative studies over the last couple of years consolidated our comprehension of a species-dependent performance of vector capsids. It is now clear that AAV8 is particularly efficient in rodents; in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans, the capsid also preferentially targets hepatocytes but with an approximately 20-fold lower efficiency. This correlation factor needs to be considered when it comes to the deduction of a clinical starting dose from the nonclinical data package. Accordingly, a starting dose of 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg TAK-754 vector was selected for the first cohort, taking into account that a dose of 3.0 × 1012 CP/kg in FVIII KO mice resulted in a mean plasma FVIII activity of 1.9 IU/mL, translating into a projected clinical FVIII activity of ∼6% of normal.",

This promoter was selected from a variety of liver-specific promoters during preclinical development of the hemophilia B vector BAX335 and came off well in a head-to-head comparison with other commonly used liver-specific promoters. The risk of relying on nonconserved murine transcription factor binding sites for a human gene therapy was mitigated by our demonstration of robust BDD-FVIII expression in the human liver HepG2 cell line upon transduction with TAK-754. Activity of the mouse TTR promoter/enhancer was also confirmed in the clinical trials for BAX335 and SPK-8011, although in the latter case, a point-mutated promoter variant was used that has converted a weak hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) binding site into a moderately stronger one.",

This approach resulted in sequences with improved expression but also greater GC content, in line with the understanding that this leads to higher mRNA levels and greater protein translation than gene sequences having greater AT content. However, this inadvertently introduced CpG clusters into the vector sequence, which function as PAMPs. These sequences can stimulate innate immune responses through signaling via TLRs, leading to an exaggerated adaptive immune response. TAK-754 candidate screening thus included a further filtering step that removed codon-optimized F8 sequences harboring potentially detrimental predicted CpG clusters. The lead candidate F8 nucleotide sequence (seq04) gave rise to a 74-fold increased expression in FVIII-KO mice compared to the corresponding WT sequence yet contains only 17 dispersed CpG motifs (Figures S2A and S2B). A further depletion of CpG motifs within the entire expression cassette, which may likewise be important for durable transgene expression, has not been carried out (Figure S2B).",

While FIX expression is associated with a low inter-species variability, that of BDD-FVIII is consistently higher and observed in mice and humans. Reports investigating the underlying mechanisms of inter-individual variability of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ (Valoctocogene roxaparvovec) expression concluded that multiple host-mediated factors could contribute.

This mouse model, which was developed to mitigate the issue of anti-human FVIII antibody formation, served its purpose to monitor TAK-754-dependent long-term expression of human BDD-FVIII. While this model also allows comparative prediction of human immune responses elicited by human FVIII variants via repeated dosing of the respective recombinant proteins according to identical protein mass, this study setup could not be mirrored with a gene therapy vector. Due to the further absence of a gold standard vector regarding FVIII immunogenicity, we did not aim for conducting a comparative FVIII immunogenicity study with the TAK-754 vector.

A successful translation of preclinical gene therapy programs into the clinic critically depends on the type and strength of the immune responses elicited against the very gene therapy vector in humans. In the case of TAK-754, while the safety profile was consistent with an AAV8-based gene therapy and all four enrolled patients in the clinical trial (this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03370172) showed dose-dependent peak FVIII activity 4 to 9 weeks after infusion (cohort 1: 2.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 3.8% and 11%, respectively; cohort 2: 6.0 × 1012 CP/kg [n = 2]: 54.7% and 69.4%, respectively), the initial vector-derived FVIII expression steadily declined despite the use of corticosteroids.

Several AAV-based hemophilia A gene therapy clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov also counted on AAV8, whereas other programs use different capsids, including AAV5, AAV6, LK03, and AAVhu37, with potential differences in their tropism or transduction efficiency. Ranking these capsids in terms of performance in humans is, however, difficult since all these vectors differ also in expression cassette design and manufacturing process employed. Clinical head-to-head comparisons of vectors differing only in the capsid serotype are lacking and would be difficult to conduct for various reasons such as cross-reactivity of anti-AAV antibodies against a broad range of serotypes.",

All but two (GO-8 and ASC618) transgenes were designed to express recombinant FVIII moroctocog alfa, although different algorithms for codon optimization were likely used, which may substantially affect expression efficiency.
