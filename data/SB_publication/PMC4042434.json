            "text": "The present studies investigated the cellular mechanisms for the detrimental effects of high dose whole body γ-irradiation on bone. In addition, radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation were assessed as interventions to mitigate the skeletal complications of irradiation. Increased trabecular thickness and separation and reduced fractional cancellous bone volume, connectivity density, and trabecular number were detected in proximal tibia and lumbar vertebra 14 days following γ-irradiation with 6 Gy. To establish the cellular mechanism for the architectural changes, vertebrae were analyzed by histomorphometry 1, 3, and 14 days following irradiation. Marrow cell density decreased within 1 day (67% reduction, p<0.0001), reached a minimum value after 3 days (86% reduction, p<0.0001), and partially rebounded by 14 days (30% reduction, p=0.0025) following irradiation. In contrast, osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was increased by 290% (1 day, p=0.04), 1230% (3 days, p<0.0001), and 530% (14 days, p=0.003), respectively. There was a strong association between radiation-induced marrow cell death and activation of bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype (Pearson correlation −0.85, p<0.0001). An increase (p=0.004) in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter was also detected with irradiation. A priming dose of γ-radiation (0.5 mGy), previously shown to reduce mortality, had minimal effect on the cellular responses to radiation and did not prevent detrimental changes in bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most indices of bone architecture following irradiation. In summary, radiation-induced death of marrow cells is associated with 1) a transient increase in bone formation due, at least in part, to activation of bone lining cells, and 2) an increase in bone resorption due to increased osteoclast perimeter. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in mitigating the detrimental effects of acute exposure to high dose whole body γ-radiation on bone turnover.",

Also, high dose whole body radiation is a common strategy in biomedical research to ablate bone marrow cells as a prelude to stem cell transplantation. As a side effect, radiation therapy to treat cancer in humans or in biomedical research results in collateral damage to other tissues, including the skeleton. The spectrum of skeletal abnormalities associated with radiation therapy in humans ranges from growth suppression in children to osteopenia, sclerosis, necrosis and sarcomatous transformation at all ages. High dose ionizing radiation is also a risk factor for the development of fractures that typically have prolonged healing times and a high nonunion rate. In spite of compelling human evidence for impaired skeletal function following high-dose ionizing radiation, this complication is rarely considered in bone marrow transplantation studies performed in animal models.",

Exposure to small (priming) doses of ionizing radiation has been shown to induce cellular radioprotective mechanisms following γ-irradiation. Induction of radioadaptation by this method reduces mortality following subsequent exposure to much higher (challenging) doses of radiation. The state of acquired radioresistance is associated with reduced radiosensitivity and hypercompensation by hematopoietic cells to radiation-induced damage. Although effective in reducing mortality, which may be of particular value for marrow transplantation studies in immune compromised radiosensitive mice, it is uncertain whether low dose radiation-induced radioresistance will impact bone marrow ablation or protect the skeleton from the detrimental effects of high dose irradiation.",

However, it is not clear whether interventions involving growth factor administration or bone marrow transplantation impact the long-duration adverse skeletal effects of irradiation.

Sections were stained according to the Von Kossa method with a tetrachrome counter stain (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) for assessment of bone area and cell-based measurements. Unstained sections were used for assessment of dynamic histomorphometry. Histomorphometric data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Static cancellous bone endpoints (Experiments 1-4) included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %) and the derived architectural indices of trabecular number (mm−1), trabecular thickness (μm), and trabecular separation (μm). Osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters were measured and expressed as % of total bone perimeter and nucleated cells were measured and expressed as marrow cell density. Fluorochrome-based indices of bone formation (Experiment 4) included mineralizing perimeter (percentage of bone with double label + ½ single label) and mineral apposition rate (mean distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by interlabel time, μm/d). Bone formation rate was calculated using a bone perimeter referent (μm2/μm/y). Additional cell measurements (Experiment 4) were performed in toluidine blue-stained sections and included megakaryocyte and adipocyte density. Megakaryocytes were measured because radiation-induced thrombocytopenia plays a role in radiation mortality. Bone marrow adipocytes were measured because radiation is associated with increased deposition of fat into bone marrow. Morphologically, megakaryocytes were identified as large cells with a multilobed nucleus. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval shaped cells, bordered by a prominent cell membrane and deficient in cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. All data are reported using standard nomenclature.",

Despite the overall dramatic reduction in marrow cellularity, cellular indices of bone formation and resorption were increased. The increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was particularly notable and was well established within 1 day of irradiation. The increase in bone turnover resulted in decreased cancellous bone volume fraction, manifested as a decrease in trabecular number that was partially offset by a simultaneous increase in trabecular thickness. As a consequence, important indices of bone quality (e.g., connectivity density) were more negatively impacted by radiation than would have been anticipated solely by the reduction in cancellous bone volume fraction. A radioconditioning priming dose (0.5 mGy) administered 24 hrs prior to administration of a challenging dose (6 Gy) was overall ineffective in moderating the effects of challenging irradiation on bone cell populations or bone architecture. Bone marrow transplantation following lethal (9 Gy) irradiation resulted in quantitative replacement of host bone marrow hematopoietic cells with donor cells, normalized bone marrow cell density, normalized indices of bone turnover, preserved normal cortical bone architecture and limited radiation-induced deterioration of cancellous bone architecture.",

This rapid response contrasts with the much longer duration required for osteoblasts to differentiate from their mesenchymal stromal cell progenitors residing within bone marrow. The timing of the increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter following challenging dose irradiation is consistent with activation of bone lining cells. Also consistent with activation of bone lining cells is the increase in trabecular thickness noted 14 days following irradiation. Bone lining cells are post-mitotic osteoblast lineage cells that line inactive bone surfaces and as such are typically much more numerous than osteoblasts. Bone lining cells can be quickly activated by hormones and growth factors such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone and basic fibroblast growth factor to express the osteoblast phenotype. The studies reported here indicate that lining cells are also activated by 6 Gy of whole-body γ-radiation.",

Osteoblast-lined bone perimeter was not reported in the Green and colleagues study and the fluorochrome labeling protocol used to calculate bone formation at later time points may have resulted in excessive label escape error, potentially compromising interpretation of dynamic bone measurements.",

            "text": "The lower cancellous bone volume observed 14 days following irradiation in our study and a similar decrease reported by Green et al. suggest that increased bone resorption ultimately predominates over the simultaneous increase in bone formation. Osteoclasts are derived from hematopoietic stem cells residing within bone marrow. Osteoclast precursors have a long lifespan in circulation. As a consequence, proliferation would not be required for the increase in osteoclast perimeter following irradiation observed in this and earlier studies. In adults, bone formation during bone remodeling is coupled spatially and temporally, but not necessarily in magnitude, to prevailing levels of bone resorption. An increase in bone resorption such as that occurring following menopause in women or ovariectomy in skeletally mature rats results in a coupled, although lesser, increase in bone formation. However, the rapid radiation-induced increase in osteoblasts in lumbar vertebra supports another mechanism, namely activation of bone lining cells. Whereas coupled bone remodeling would tend to preserve bone architecture, the absence of coupling between bone resorption and bone formation observed in this study acts to accentuate changes in bone architecture (increased trabecular thickness and reduced trabecular number) in irradiated mice because the increases in bone formation and resorption are occurring at discrete sites.",

Whereas proliferating cells are highly sensitive to radiation, post-mitotic bone cells are resistant to radiation-induced cell death. Activation of bone lining cells and osteoclast formation from circulating osteoclast precursors represent post-mitotic cell differentiation. The mechanism for the increased bone turnover following irradiation is likely directly related to bone marrow failure. Plausible, non-mutually exclusive mechanisms include: 1) activation of osteoblasts and recruitment of osteoclast precursors from blood by factors released from bone marrow cells in response to radiation and/or 2) failure of dying marrow cells to produce factors that inhibit bone turnover.",

In the present study, marrow cell depletion occurred within 1 day following irradiation and partially rebounded by 14 days. High dose irradiation results in a rapid increase in gene expression for platelet derived growth factor-β and basic fibroblast growth factor, providing a potential mechanism for the radiation-induced increase in osteoblasts because these growth factors have been implicated in the bone lining cell to osteoblast transition. However, bone marrow ablation, a method that removes bone marrow cells, also induces a dramatic bone turnover response. Bone turnover is regulated by hematopoietic cells and hematological disorders such as anemia result in skeletal disorders. Thus, hematopoietic cells may inhibit transition of lining cells to osteoblasts. As such, loss of this negative regulation by hematopoietic lineage cells is a plausible alternative mechanism for increased bone turnover following irradiation. An important implication of the putative negative regulation of bone turnover by hematopoietic lineage cells would be that restoration of normal hematopoiesis following irradiation may be essential to restore normal bone turnover.",

A radioconditioning dose of 0.5 mGy has been shown to reduce mortality in mice exposed to a challenging dose of γ-radiation. The mechanism for the protective effect of prior exposure to the lower dose radiation is incompletely understood. However, more rapid recovery of hematopoietic cells, depressed tumor suppressor gene expression, and induction of antioxidative and repair enzymes appear to contribute to the protective effects. Whatever the precise mechanisms for improved survival, a standard radioconditioning priming dose of 0.5 mGy was ineffective in moderating the acute skeletal effects of irradiation (6 Gy) on bone. Thus, a rapid restoration of bone marrow cell populations may be critical because relatively long duration studies failed to show skeletal recovery in mice exposed to high but sub-lethal doses of ionizing radiation.",

            "text": "Bone marrow transplantation was effective in repopulating the bone marrow cavity following lethal irradiation. Megakaryocyte and total marrow cell density were normal two months following bone marrow transplantation. Additionally, adipocytes in the bone marrow were rare. These findings are significant because high dose radiation has been reported to deplete the megakaryocyte population and increase bone marrow adiposity. Also, GFP tracking studies demonstrate that the vast majority of hematopoietic cells and a lesser but substantial portion of the mesenchymal cells were derived from the donor mice. Importantly, bone marrow transplantation resulted in normalization of bone turnover. Although many of the bone architectural parameters did not differ between control and irradiated marrow transplanted mice, the transplanted mice had shorter tibia and site-specific reductions in fractional bone volume (lumbar vertebra but not distal femur metaphysis or epiphysis), connectivity density (lumbar vertebra and distal femur epiphysis but not distal femur metaphysis), and trabecular number (distal femur metaphysis but not lumbar vertebra or distal femur epiphysis). The failure of bone marrow transplantation to restore all bone values to normal is not surprising. Repopulation of the marrow with donor cells is time-dependent and donor cells would not directly contribute to enhancing recovery of growth plate cartilage. Also, high dose radiation followed by bone marrow transplantation during childhood impairs gonadal function in boys and girls. Finally, the concomitant use of chemotherapy drugs which negatively and irreversibly impact bone mass and architecture may contribute to the detrimental skeletal effects of bone marrow transplantation in humans. Consistent with a decrease in uterine weight observed in irradiated mice in the present study (data not shown), radiation has been shown to negatively impact the ovarian reserve and uterine growth and function and decrease serum estrogen levels. Gonadal hormones, especially estrogen, are important regulators of bone metabolism. Thus, radiation may either transiently or irreversibly affect the levels of gonadal hormones that influence bone metabolism. In spite of these limitations, bone marrow transplantation in addition to preventing death, minimized development of skeletal abnormalities in lethally irradiated mice.",
