            "text": "Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Igκ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.",

The heavy chain locus encodes multiple Variable- (V), Diversity- (D) and Joining- (J) gene segments, while the functionally equivalent κ (Igκ) and (Ig) light chain loci contain only V- and J-gene segments. During early B-cell development in the bone marrow, B cells undergo recombination of heavy and light chain Ig loci, in which only one of each V(D)J-gene segment is selected for Ig use.

Briefly, FASTQ files were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and were quality trimmed and filtered to remove sequences less than 40 nt in length to prevent false V-gene segment assignment. Paired-end sequences and overlapping-paired (merged) sequences were mapped to both V-gene segment references obtained from the ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT) database (251 IgH segments, 135 Igκ segments), and to entire IgH and Igκ loci obtained from NCBI (NC_000078.6, 113258768 to 116009954, and NC_000072.6, 67555636 to 70726754, respectively). Mapped sequencing reads were submitted to the IMGT HighV-Quest tool for characterization of functionality and junctional analysis. Only one sequence per sequencing cluster was retained for further analysis as outlined in Rettig et al. Briefly, per sequencing organization ID, the read with the most information is saved for further analysis. Antibody sequences can differ by as little as a single nucleotide and without a unique barcoding step during amplification, removing similar, but not identical sequences, could limit the breadth of the repertoire sampled. Due to this, no further filtering was performed on sequences. A motif search was performed in CLC on IgH sequences that were identified by IMGT as productive to determine their respective constant regions.",

We found that CDR3 length in IgH was highly varied. The length ranged from one amino acid to 35 (Figure 5A). The average CDR3 lengths for all the ground control animals was 12±0. The average CDR3 lengths for flight animals was also 12±1. The CDR3 lengths were not normally distributed in the flight or ground animals (flight p=<0.0001, ground p=0.0128) with the majority of CDR3 lengths falling between 11 and 14 AAs. We also examined the heavy-chain CDR3 length by isotype (Table 5) and by treatment group. We found no significant difference by treatment group or by isotype (two-way ANOVA, interaction p=0.8141, isotype p=0.4589, treatment p=0.6225).",

Ground mouse one (0.9%), was an exception and was enriched for 11 amino acid CDR3s (2.3%) compared to other animals (0.2–0.7%).

CDR3 rearrangements of these lengths were often only detected in one animal and expression of these lengths did not exceed 0.01% of the repertoire. Additionally, these rearrangements may have been identified in error as many of these rearrangements contain intervening phenylalanine residues within the There was little overlap among IgH CDR3s regardless of treatment (Figure 6A, C). Of the top five CDR3s found in each animal, we identified 26 unique CDR3 AA rearrangements. Of those 26 CDR3s, four were found in all six animals. Two additional rearrangements were identified in three animals. One of those rearrangements, CASHGSSYLAWFAYW, was found in only flight animals and not found in any ground animals. Six CDR3s were found in two animals, and the remainder were found in a single animal. The vast majority of CDR3 rearrangements detected were unique to each animal (6,661–9,270 rearrangements), though there was a small amount of overlap among animals (103–163 CDR3 rearrangements). For flight animals, 78 CDR3 rearrangements were found in all three animals and 70 were found in all three ground animals.

Although we do not account for B-cell subpopulations, we do measure the total splenic Ig repertoire. Additionally, since we did not use specific amplification of Ig sequences the depth of sequencing was not as high as some have accomplished looking at Ig gene usage. We have compared of amplified and unamplified data sets by our lab show reasonable correlations of the data, with more V-gene segments being detected in the unamplified data sets (, In Revision). Amplification with multiplex Ig specific primers may introduce amplification bias as primers may bind with varying efficiency to V-gene segments, although there have been recent advances in experimental approach to address amplification bias. We also found that the type of RNA-Seq analysis we are using in the assessment of younger C57Bl/6J mouse Ig gene usage, correlated well with that of studies using amplification.

Gene segment combinations and CDR3 sequences were highly varied, demonstrating the combinatorial diversity of the antibody repertoire, but that variation reflects the dynamics of individualized selection of Ig molecules and not any impact of spaceflight. A larger sample size would help solidify this conclusion, but these data provide preliminary suggestions that the recombinatorial processes that lead to the diverse Ig repertoires in mice are not affected by a short trip to and stay on the ISS. These data do not preclude that differences in the Ig repertoires of ground and flight animals will not be seen during active immunization or in younger, possibly more recombinatorily active mice.
