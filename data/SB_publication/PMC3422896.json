Throughout their history of discovery and description, the 14-3-3s have been described as protein families and there has been some evidence that the different 14-3-3 family members within any organism might carry isoform-specific functions. However, there has also been evidence for redundancy of 14-3-3 function, suggesting that the perceived 14-3-3 diversity may be the accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time and as some 14-3-3 genes develop tissue or organ-specific expression. This situation has led to a currently unresolved question – does 14-3-3 isoform sequence diversity indicate functional diversity at the biochemical or cellular level? We discuss here some of the key observations on both sides of the resulting debate, and present a set of contrastable observations to address the theory functional diversity does exist among 14-3-3 isoforms. The resulting model suggests strongly that there are indeed functional specificities in the 14-3-3s of Arabidopsis. The model further suggests that 14-3-3 diversity and specificity should enter into the discussion of 14-3-3 roles in signal transduction and be directly approached in 14-3-3 experimentation. It is hoped that future studies involving 14-3-3s will continue to address specificity in experimental design and analysis.",

Numerous pathways and processes rely on the 14-3-3 interactions to regulate key metabolic points (e.g.,). The conservation of 14-3-3 structure among eukaryotes speaks to their essential nature, yet the divergence into so many isoforms in each of these species suggests an intricate network of roles for these proteins (e.g.,). Most plants have about a dozen 14-3-3 genes that provide sequence and functional diversity potentially leading to specialized structures and functions within the various members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. That diversity can be enlarged by selective phosphorylation of 14-3-3s at several known sites across the protein, sites that are variously retained among the isoforms. The purpose of this paper is to examine the evolutionary and biochemical diversity of 14-3-3s and question whether this diversity has any intrinsic biochemical, cellular, or physiological significance; then present approaches to answer that question.",

The 14-3-3s interact with phosphorylated peptide sequences through sequence-specific motifs RSxpSxP, RSxxpSxP, and YpT, among others. The phosphorylated serine or threonine forms both hydrogen and ionic bonds with highly conserved residues found in the basic binding pocket of the 14-3-3 protein. In vertebrate isoform 14-3-3τ, these residues are located at K49, R56, and R127. Binding can also occur with non-phosphorylated sequences, such as GHSL and WLDLE. These diverse binding sequences permit the 14-3-3 proteins to participate in a wide range of phosphorylation-based signaling pathways.

These regions can also be overlain onto a structural model to help predict regions that may be important structurally or functionally (Figure 3). Although there are regions that show high conservation across all isoforms, it is apparent that there are certain sub-groupings of isoforms that show greater sequence similarity to each other. Conservation patterns can be logically classified along well-supported evolutionary lineages which may imply a specialization-driven divergence. This potentially suggests that selection pressures are present in the family due to their involvement in specialized function and complex formation, but this is a suggestion based on divergence branching pattern and not on the acquisition or loss of known functionalities. Plant 14-3-3s can be divided into two main subgroups, the ε and non-ε groups. The non-ε group can be further subdivided, with four of these groupings occurring in the last 170 million years. Additionally, the ε group tends to have deep branching in all plant species, suggesting that ε isoforms retain ancestral protein function. The presence of multiple isoforms, however, leads to the question of functional differences. Are these different isoforms performing different cellular functions? Or do these proteins act redundantly as backups to perform these vital functions?",

A recent study in Arabidopsis found evidence for phosphorylation of several isoforms at different sites at the C-terminus of the proteins. This is a region of very low sequence conservation (Figures 2 and 3) providing the potential for phosphorylation to affect 14-3-3s in an isoform-specific manner.

In plants there are three sites within the C-terminal tail (helix 9) which are phosphorylated during seed development in Brassica and, as mentioned above, there is also evidence for phosphorylation at the C-terminus in Arabidopsis. Based on the data from mammals, it can be predicted that this may affect the conformation of the C-terminus and client binding.

Dimer formation in 14-3-3s involves interactions within residues of the first four alpha helices. In any cell containing multiple isoforms, if all isoforms could dimerize freely with each other, this would allow for many different combinations. It has been argued that this could dilute out any functional differences between or among isoforms. However, there is evidence, particularly from the mammalian literature, that fully random dimerization is not always the case and that there are preferences for certain dimer combinations. This potential is provided by the fact that helices 1 through 4 do contain some of the areas of higher sequence variation among isoforms.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that homodimers and heterodimers could have different functions. In mammalian systems, studies have shown that two isoforms in particular, 14-3-3σ and 14-3-3ε, show a preference to form either homodimers or heterodimers. In one study, immunoprecipitation of endogenous 14-3-3σ from a human cancer cell line showed that it was present primarily as homodimers whereas 14-3-3β formed heterodimers to a much greater extent. It is thought that this preference of 14-3-3σ to homodimerize allows it to bind isoform-specific clients and play a specific role in the DNA damage checkpoint that is not shared with other isoforms. Conversely, 14-3-3ε has been detected only as heterodimers when expressed in vivo. Studies of the crystal structure of the mammalian isoforms have helped to explain why this preference for homodimers or heterodimers may exist. There are a number of variable amino acids in the dimer interface between isoforms. Subsequently, the number of stabilizing salt bridges in the dimer interface varies between one and three depending on the isoform. In the case of the 14-3-3σ homodimer, there are three salt bridges and also extra interactions between aromatic ring side chains, stabilizing the homodimers. If 14-3-3ε was to form a homodimers, there would only be one stabilizing salt bridge and therefore may be the reason why ε prefers to form heterodimers. The two yeast 14-3-3s also show an inclination to form heterodimers rather than homodimers. There is also evidence for preferences for particular heterodimer partners in mammals. Specificity was shown in the dimer partners co-immunoprecipitated with myc-tagged 14-3-3ε or 14-3-3γ expressed in neuronal cells which did not appear due to the amount of total endogenous isoform present.",

Our early studies looking at the in vitro dimerization potential of different recombinant Arabidopsis 14-3-3s hinted that there may be some differences between isoforms in their preferences for dimer partners. In that study, although all four Arabidopsis isoforms tested were able to form all combinations of both homodimers and heterodimers in yeast-2-hybrid, there were interesting results when different isoform pairs were renatured in vitro and analyzed by native gels, which suggested there are differences in the ratios of homodimers to heterodimers present between different isoform pairs. In another Arabidopsis study, TAP tagged 14-3-3ω expressed in cell suspension cells was detected as both homodimers as well as heterodimers with nine other isoforms suggesting that in cells this isoform is able to form dimer partners with multiple isoforms. In contrast, in a yeast two-hybrid study with cotton 14-3-3s, none of the six isoforms were able to form homodimers, yet heterodimers were detected. Selectivity was also shown in the particular heterodimer partners of the isoforms.",

Further, dimerization is likely to be variable within cell types, depending on the expression levels and sub-cellular localization of different isoforms, in addition to the phosphorylation status of isoforms. As mentioned above, phosphorylation of 14-3-3s can inhibit dimerization. There is evidence in mammals that monomeric 14-3-3s may be functional too and may have different client binding properties to the dimers.

Disproving specificity as a hypothesis would be difficult, as lack of data cannot constitute proof of the hypothesis as being false. Therefore, our formally stated null hypothesis would be that no functional specificity exists among 14-3-3s. Rejection of this null hypothesis would be accomplished by any clear observations of specific function between or among 14-3-3 isoforms, which would then support our broader theory of specificity among 14-3-3s. In general, we posit that certain 14-3-3s in a given cellular context – and only those 14-3-3s – will have specific interactions that are not shared with other 14-3-3s, and as a result, certain 14-3-3s will have functional phenotypes revealed by mutation. Data are emerging from the literature in support of this notion. As a particular outcome for developing tests of the hypothesis, we posit that multiple 14-3-3s may be present in equal concentrations within a cell, yet each may biochemically interact with different clients and each may therefore have different cellular functions and localizations. Data from the literature and some primary data are presented in support of this notion. Full consideration of all factors suggests that it is possible that restricted groups of isoforms may have interactions and functions that are shared within that group. Members of a certain evolutionary branch would be one example of a group with potential shared specificities. 14-3-3s phosphorylated at a certain residue might also constitute a functionally specific group. And it is also possible that some biochemical and cellular functions could be shared by all isoforms. But the main idea of the theory is that out of the family of conserved, dimerizing 14-3-3s within a plant cell, certain isoforms or isoform groups do have certain specific biochemical interactions and functions.",

It is certainly possible that developmental specificity of expression could present certain 14-3-3s with prominent roles in certain tissues, regardless of the specificity at the cellular or biochemical level. We therefore discuss briefly just how much tissue-specific expression of 14-3-3s might exist, then we examine redundancy and specificity at the cellular and biochemical levels as these levels do address directly the questions of functional specificity among protein isoforms.",

In addition, yeast two-hybrid studies in barley show differences in interaction levels for clients and barley isoforms differ in their ability to inhibit NR or regulate K+ channels. Six cotton 14-3-3s showed specificity in target binding in yeast two-hybrid study. These studies do not necessarily stand in contrast to those studies cited above in which biochemical redundancy was demonstrated.

The other force influencing 14-3-3 localization would be the location of the client protein. Localization of the 14-3-3/client complex would be dependent upon not only the localization signals of the 14-3-3 but also on the localization signal of the client protein.

Most estimates of potential 14-3-3 interacting proteins in any cell, based on the presence of the canonical 14-3-3 recognition sequences, range from hundreds to thousands. If these interacting proteins actually occur and are distributed randomly among cell compartments (nucleus, cytoplasm, and plasma membrane, for example), the given 14-3-3 isoform should be broadly dispersed among cellular locations because of the many locations of its clients. Under such conditions of promiscuous client interaction, a specific subcellular localization of any given 14-3-3 would be very unlikely. However, there certainly are distinct 14-3-3 subcellular localizations that are tissue-specific and different among 14-3-3 isoforms in plants. Further, disrupting the client interactions can influence the localization of specific 14-3-3s. Thus any observable, limited, specific subcellular localization of a 14-3-3 supports the notion that the 14-3-3 is interacting with a specific subset of cellular proteins (see Figure 6).",

If the two isoforms were interacting with the same clients, the two isoforms would be present in the same subcellular locales. However, isoform-specific immunocytochemistry demonstrates that individual 14-3-3s can and do partition themselves in different locations within the cell. Figure 6 illustrates the localization of 14-3-3χ and 14-3-3ε in a young Arabidopsis root. Both χ and ε are robustly expressed in roots (see Figure 5). Yet the localization patterns for χ and ε are distinctly different across the cells of the root tip (Figure 6A). In the central cells marked with the C box in Figure 6, χ is largely nuclear, while ε is largely associated with the plasma membrane or cell wall. This single observation has dramatic implications for the notion of isoform-specific functionality. Because χ and ε are in two separate and distinct locations, they cannot be extensively heterodimerizing with each other. If expressed equally and randomly dimerizing, χ and ε would be present in a ratio of 1:2:1 of χ homodimers:χ/ε heterdomers:ε homodimers. Therefore, two-third of the red and green signals would be combined into a yellow heterodimer signal. This is clearly not the case. In fact the majority of signal in these cells is distinctly green or red. Because χ and ε are in separate subcellular locales, they cannot be interacting with the same clients or subsets of clients unless the intrinsic localization signals of the 14-3-3s are distinct and direct the localization of the complex. Moreover, the fact of specific and limited localization of these isoforms suggests that in these cells, χ and ε are interacting with few, potentially unique, client proteins.",

On the other hand, 14-3-3κ-GFP is almost exclusively nuclear (Figure 6E). 14-3-3λ-GFP is generally expressed at lower levels, but when it is found in guard cells, it is always localized to the edges that define the stomata (Figure 6F). This marked difference in the distribution of κ and λ was surprising given the similarity of the two isoforms, however, distinct functional roles for these two related isoforms has also been demonstrated with respect to Phot2-mediated processes, where it was shown that λ played a role in stomatal opening in response to blue light, but κ did not. The distribution of 14-3-3φ-GFP is seen throughout the cell and nucleus, but is especially prominent along the cytoskeleton (Figure 6G).

Given the wide expression profiles of most plant 14-3-3 genes, it is likely that almost every cell in the plant has a fairly complex population of different 14-3-3 isoforms and that many cells contain many 14-3-3 isoforms. Therefore, the existence of phenotype(s) associated with individual 14-3-3 insertion mutations is strong evidence that the particular isoform plays an important role that is not entirely complemented by other 14-3-3s present in a cell. Earlier, general studies showing that some 14-3-3 insertion mutations displayed no phenotype are now being supplanted by specific studies of well characterized insertion mutations that do display phenotypes. Furthermore, cell biology observations define another element of specificity. Within a particular cell, different 14-3-3s can be found in distinct subcellular locations, demonstrating clearly that the different 14-3-3s cannot be interacting with all of the same clients and serving the same cellular function. Among many, the example of 14-3-3λ and 14-3-3κ is quite compelling and complete.

This is a key element often missing in current 14-3-3 literature. With increasing TDNA mutations publically available, for example, contrasts in experiments should accompany statements of 14-3-3 roles, including data where no phenotype is observed in some mutation(s). Care should be taken to be specific in the description of isoforms in an experiment and conclusions drawn from one isoform should not be considered to be true for other isoforms until tested. The limits of reagents and databases should be taken into consideration. For example, the Affymetrix array does not list a probeset for 14-3-3φ, and the probeset for 14-3-3χ very likely hybridizes with both 14-3-3φ and χ, presenting a likely over estimate of 14-3-3χ expression. Similarly, proteomics peptide databases do not always properly distinguish among isoforms, and peptides can be identified being from a particular isoform when in fact that peptide can be from all members of an evolutionary group. And TDNA insertions can result in various levels of 14-3-3 expression at the protein level. Deeper understanding of the 14-3-3 families and their roles as individual isoforms will therefore require experiments that are comparative among isoforms and a refined approach that increases the ability to identify individual isoforms and isoform groups as experimental contrasts.",

            "text": "The theory of 14-3-3 specificity predicts that, when properly monitored and experimentally contrasted, certain 14-3-3 isoforms have a function that is not present in other isoforms – even if that isoform is present in the same cell. This theory does not preclude that there will be examples of overlapping function, but it does state that some functions will be clearly distinct among isoforms. Other systems of isoform families have embraced this notion. For instance, mammalian Akt protein kinases are highly conserved and function in the regulation of a diversity of cellular functions. Yet phenotypic studies with knockout mice have demonstrated that the three isoforms that comprise this family play distinct roles in the regulation of cellular growth, glucose homeostasis, and neuronal development. This reverse genetics approach establishes that the functions of each Akt isoform do not wholly overlap, and demonstrates that isoform-specific signaling contributes to the diversity of Akt activities in mice. In Drosophila, the demonstration that lines deficient in one or the other of their two 14-3-3 genes were not fully functional lead to the discovery that D14-3-3ε plays a specific role in pole cell migration, a specific function that could not be rescued by 14-3-3 Leo. Thus it is apparent that specificity in isoform families can be discovered and appreciated within an enabled and aware experimental context.",
