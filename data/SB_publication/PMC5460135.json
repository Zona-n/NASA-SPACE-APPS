However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, high aspect ratio vessel S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated ≥2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated ≥2-fold during simulated microgravity high aspect ratio vessel growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.",

These findings could help explain why astronauts are at a greater risk for dental diseases when in space. Kelly Rice and colleagues from the University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, cultured Streptococcus mutans bacteria under simulated microgravity and normal gravity conditions. The bacteria grown in microgravity were more susceptible to killing with hydrogen peroxide, tended to aggregate in more compact cellular structures, showed changes in their metabolite profile and expressed around 250 genes at levels that were either much higher or lower than normal gravity control cultures. These genes included many involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein production and stress responses. The observed changes collectively suggest that space flight and microgravity could alter the cavities-causing potential of S. mutans.",

            "text": " Streptococcus mutans is a primary causative agent of dental caries, demonstrated by its isolation from carious tooth lesions in humans, its ability to initiate caries in germ-free rodent models of infection, and the established link between high levels of this bacterium in the oral cavity and active caries. Although preventable by fluoridation of water and various dental procedures,, caries remains the most common chronic disease among children, and remains untreated in up to 30% of adults over 35 years-old. S. mutans transient bacteremias can also initiate endocarditis in at-risk patient groups. Successful colonization of the oral cavity and persistence in multi-species dental plaque by S. mutans is inherently dependent on both its ability to form biofilm and its rapid metabolism of carbohydrates by the glycolytic pathway. The low pH that results from accumulation of acidic metabolic end-products favors the growth of S. mutans and other acid-tolerant species relative to healthy plaque microflora, as well as the eventual demineralization of tooth enamel and the development of caries. Adherence of S. mutans to the tooth surface and subsequent biofilm development are mediated by several bacterial factors, including production of sucrose-dependent extracellular glucan polymers by glucosyltransferase enzymes, specific cell surface adhesins, the major autolysin AtlA, the quorum-sensing competence (com) system, and extracellular DNA.

            "text": "To protect the health of astronauts during space flight missions, it is critical to understand the effects of this environment on both host biology and the host microbiota. Simulated microgravity exposure has been shown to cause increased mandibular and alveolar bone loss and decreased saliva flow, significant predisposing host factors that could contribute to development of caries and/or periodontal disease. Traditionally, the approach to maintaining astronaut oral health during space flight missions has been routed in preventative dentistry, whereby astronauts are subjected to rigorous preflight dental screening and treatment. However, in the face of future long-term space flight missions, research and discovery of new methods for maintaining oral hygiene and dental health under a microgravity environment are required. Previous studies on the effects of spaceflight on the oral microbiota have primarily focused on culture-dependent methods of quantifying the numbers of oral bacteria in human subjects before and after spaceflight. Furthermore, astronauts have been shown to exhibit decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation in response to space flight. However, assessment of the physiology and virulence potential of oral pathogens such as S. mutans under controlled microgravity analog conditions has been relatively lacking. In this respect, rotating wall vessel bioreactors are a common technology used to grow bacteria under microgravity analog conditions in ground-based studies. When completely filled with media (lacking air bubbles or “head space”) and rotated on the axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector, these reactors maintain a low-shear environment (<1 dyn/cm2) whereby gravitational vectors are randomized over the surface of the cells or particles contained within the vessel. As such, this simulated environment models “weightlessness” by counteracting gravitational forces that would otherwise promote cellular sedimentation. The low-shear force experienced in this microgravity analog system boasts the additional advantage of mimicking the low-shear force of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by plaque bacteria in the oral cavity. In this study, high-aspect rotating vessels (HARVs) were therefore used to ascertain the effects of simulated microgravity on S. mutans gene expression, physiology, oxidative stress resistance, and competence, using both culture-dependent and “-omic” (metabolomics and RNA-seq) approaches.",

In this analysis, no statistically significant differences in CFU/ml at each time point were observed (Supplemental Fig. S1). An initial decrease in CFU/ml was observed in both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures between t = 0 (time of inoculation) and t = 2 h growth, which was likely a function of sucrose-dependent cell aggregation. Very small differences in cell viability patterns in early stationary phase (6–8 h growth) suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV culture may have entered stationary phase slightly sooner than the normal gravity HARV culture in this experiment. As well, the simulated microgravity culture persisted in stationary phase until approximately 12 h growth, followed by a somewhat rapid death phase, with a 1-log loss of viability between 12 and 24 h growth. In contrast, the viability of normal gravity culture underwent a more gradual decrease in cell viability between 12 and 24 h of growth.",

Therefore, these growth curves were also performed using an “end-point” approach, whereby simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures (n = 2 independent experiments per time point per growth condition) were grown undisturbed in replicate HARV vessels for t = 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 1). Using this end-point approach, no significant differences in CFU/ml were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV cultures at the assessed time points (Fig. 1), and the initial drop in CFU/ml observed early in the growth curves of the continuous cultures (Supplemental Fig. S1) was not observed in these end-point cultures. As well, both the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures underwent the same pattern of growth when monitored with this end-point approach: Log phase growth occurred between 0 and 6 h, and both cultures were in early stationary phase at 8 h growth, followed by entry into late stationary phase/death phase between 24 and 48 h growth. Interestingly, differences in macroscopic cell aggregation were consistently observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity HARV conditions when using the end-point growth analysis. Specifically, the simulated microgravity condition tended to form round/compact cellular structures, whereas the aggregates in the normal gravity growth condition tended to form less compact structures (Fig. 2).

Given that macroscopic differences in the self-aggregating clusters of S. mutans cells were consistently observed at the t = 8 h time point (Fig. 2), RNA-seq analysis was also performed on the t = 8 h samples. Principle component analysis (PCA) of metabolomics data generated from t = 4, 8, and 24 h HARV cultures (Supplemental Files S2 and S3) revealed a strong relationship between the time of growth (t = 4, 8, and 24 h) and metabolite profile for each of the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures (Fig. 3). However, a much weaker “time-treatment” relationship existed when comparing the metabolite profile between simulated microgravity vs. normal gravity cultures at each time point. Welch’s two sample t tests revealed 8, 14, and 10 statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in cellular metabolite production between cells grown under normal gravity and microgravity conditions at the 4, 8, and 24 h time points, respectively (Supplemental File S2). Likewise, 21, 21, and 23 statistically significant differences were observed between the corresponding culture supernatant samples at these time points (Supplemental File S3). Keeping in mind the caveat that the number of significant differences at each time point were close to that expected by random chance alone (5% error rate), the significant changes of cell-associated and supernatant metabolites of the 8 h HARV cultures are summarized in Table 1, and their potential relationship to the corresponding 8 h RNA-seq data are discussed below.

Compared to the metabolomics data, differential expression analysis of the 8 h RNA-seq data revealed a large number of statistically significant gene expression changes in normal gravity relative to simulated microgravity growth (Supplemental File S4). Specifically, 94 genes were up-regulated (log2 fold-change ≥1.0) and 153 genes were down-regulated (log2 fold-change ≤−1.0) in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity cultures. These patterns in gene expression were confirmed by qPCR for a subset of genes (Supplemental Table S1). Functional classification (Fig. 4) revealed that expression of a large number of genes associated with transposon sequences, as well as several genes encoding predicted phage proteins, were down-regulated in normal gravity cultures relative to simulated microgravity growth. A second trend of interest was the significant down-regulated expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including various phosphotransferase (PTS) systems, the carbon catabolite protein regulator ccpA, and the redox sensitive transcriptional regulator rex, in the 8 h normal gravity cultures relative to the simulated microgravity cultures (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). Increased expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs and other aspects of protein translation was also observed in the normal gravity cultures compared to simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of a large number of genes encoding transcriptional regulators was decreased in the normal gravity cultures (Fig. 4).

This analysis revealed the presence of four significant (enrichment scores ≥1.3) functional annotation clusters in the down-regulated normal gravity genes, which included genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and transport (cluster I), transcriptional regulators (clusters II and III), and carbohydrate transporters/other membrane proteins (cluster IV). As well, functional annotation clusters involved in arginine metabolism (cluster V) and nucleoside/tRNA metabolism (cluster VI) were significantly enriched (enrichment scores ≥1.3) in the up-regulated normal gravity genes. To identify metabolic pathways potentially altered under the simulated microgravity growth condition, all statistically-significant changes in 8 h growth gene expression from the RNA-seq differential expression analysis with a minimum log2 fold-change of at least ±0.6 were also analyzed using the bioinformatics program Metacyc.. The top metabolic pathways identified by this analysis were mixed acid fermentation (seven genes), arginine biosynthesis (six genes), and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis (five genes) (Supplemental Fig. S3). Specifically, genes involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to 2-oxoglutarate (a TCA cycle intermediate), arginine biosynthesis, and dCDP/dTMP biosynthesis were upregulated in the normal gravity HARV cultures, whereas genes involved in ethanol and acetate fermentation were down-regulated in normal gravity HARV cultures. Interestingly, when comparing these metabolic pathways to statistically-significant changes in cellular metabolites at 8 h growth (Table 1), several matched to the corresponding metabolic pathway changes (Supplemental Fig. S3) identified in the RNA-seq data by Metacyc, including 2-oxogluarate (alpha-ketoglutarate; mixed acid fermentation), pyruvate (mixed acid fermentation), argininosuccinate (arginine biosynthesis), uridine monophosphate and uracil (pyrmidine deoxynucleotide de novo biosynthesis).

In the Skylab missions conducted in the 1970s, the effects of space flight and diet on the oral cavity and oral microbiota of astronauts were documented using culture-dependent methods. These studies demonstrated that increased counts of specific oral bacteria (i.e. Bacteriodes, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Neisseria, S. sanguinus, and S. mutans) were recovered from the astronauts in response to space flight. Furthermore, the astronauts in these studies exhibited decreased salivary lysozyme and increased dental calculus and gingival inflammation. More recently, the effect of simulated microgravity on the physiology and biofilm structure of S. mutans was also assessed using a superconducting magnet capable of generating a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which mimics the space-like gravity environment by achieving stable levitation of diamagnetic materials such as biological cells and tissues. The results of this study suggested that growth of S. mutans under simulated microgravity enhanced its acid tolerance, altered its biofilm architecture, and increased its proportion within dual-species biofilms co-cultured with S. sanguinis, an H2O2-producing early colonizer of dental plaque biofilm. Collectively, these previous studies suggest that both space flight and the microgravity analog environment have the ability to alter the cariogenic potential of S. mutans.",

            "text": "In our current work, HARVs rotated on an axis perpendicular to the Earth’s gravitational vector were used to simulate a low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) growth environment. This ground-based model of microgravity has been used to study the response of a variety of microorganisms to “weightlessness” that would be encountered during space flight [reviewed in]. However, it is important to keep in mind that the S. mutans LSMMG-associated metabolic and physiological changes (i.e. alterations in cell aggregation, transcriptome, and sensitivity to oxidative stress) presented here could represent the bacteria’s response to either simulated microgravity and/or low-fluid shear (<1 dyn/cm2) specific environmental signals, the latter of which may be relevant to the fluid shear of saliva flow (<0.8 dyn/cm2) experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity. Therefore, the data obtained in this study have the potential to shed light on S. mutans physiology and virulence properties relevant to environmental signals experienced in the host, and will hopefully provide a springboard for planning future space flight studies of oral bacteria. It is also important to note that all of the S. mutans experiments presented in this study were conducted in semi-defined culture medium containing 11 mM glucose and 10 mM sucrose, previously shown to promote in vitro S. mutans biofilm formation. The addition of sucrose, a host dietary sugar to which S. mutans is exposed to in the oral cavity, promotes production of extracellular glucan polymers by S. mutans, important biofilm matrix components that promote intracellular adhesion. In reality, the in vivo plaque biofilm environment of S. mutans is much more complex, including stress conditions such as interspecies competition for nutrients and space within the biofilm, as well as alternating periods of “feast and famine” with respect to dietary carbohydrate consumption. Therefore, the growth condition used in this study should be considered a simple representation of caries-promoting “feast” conditions experienced by S. mutans in the oral cavity. With these caveats in mind, the following discussion points represent interesting patterns/conclusions from the data obtained in this study:",

S. mutans displays an altered early stationary-phase metabolism under simulated microgravity conditions: As indicated in the “Results” section and Fig. 1, S. mutans “end-point” simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures appear to enter stationary phase at the same point in growth (6 h) compared to normal gravity cultures, and there were no apparent differences in CFU/ml of each culture at each time point. This being said, the 8 h (early stationary phase) metabolomics and RNA-seq data suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity metabolism at this point is altered relative to normal gravity growth. For example, simulated microgravity cultures experienced a ten-fold decrease in supernatant glucose levels (Table 1 and Supplemental File S3) at 8 h growth relative to the normal gravity cultures. Furthermore, expression of PTS system genes involved in transport of carbohydrates (glucose, mannitol, trehalose, mannose and cellobiose) was significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth, whereas expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, tRNAs, and other aspects of protein translation was decreased in the microgravity cultures at this time point (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4 ). Bioinformatics analysis also revealed patterns of decreased arginine metabolism and decreased pyrimidine biosynthesis (Supplemental Table S2 and Supplemental Fig. S3) in the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures. Finally, expression of genes encoding the central metabolic transcriptional regulators CcpA and Rex were also both upregulated (2.2-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively) at 8 h growth in the simulated microgravity cultures. CcpA has been shown to regulate S. mutans catabolite repression and the ability to utilize non-preferred carbohydrates, acid tolerance, acid production, and biofilm formation, whereas Rex regulates expression of S. mutans genes involved with carbohydrate fermentation, biofilm formation, and oxidative stress resistance in response to cellular redox. Interestingly, a role for Rex in the transcriptional response of Staphylococcus aureus to LSMMG was also previously implicated by the altered expression of a number of Rex-regulated genes under this growth condition. Although great care was taken in each experiment to vigorously vortex all samples prior to and during serial dilution plating, we cannot exclude the possibility that sucrose-dependent cell clumping may have masked more apparent growth differences between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity end-point HARV cultures in these studies.",

S. mutans late stationary-phase simulated microgravity cultures appear to be subject to increased stress: A striking phenotypic property observed in S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures was the greatly increased sensitivity of cells from late stationary phase (16 h) to H2O2 treatment (Fig. 5c) relative to cells from normal gravity cultures. However, no apparent differences in oxidative stress resistance were observed between the simulated microgravity and normal gravity cells harvested at earlier time points (log phase and early stationary phase, Fig. 5a, b, respectively). This result correlated with the LG-HMF S. mutans microgravity study by Cheng and co-workers, which found that mid-exponential phase S. mutans microgravity and normal gravity cells did not differ in their sensitivity to H2O2. In previous studies, late stationary-phase (20–24 h) cultures of S. typhimurium and P. aeruginosa were both shown to be more resistant to oxidative stress when grown in simulated microgravity, whereas S. typhimurium simulated microgravity cultures grown to an earlier phase of growth (10 h) displayed increased sensitivity to H2O2 treatment. Furthermore, the sensitivity of stationary phase simulated microgravity cultures of adherent-invasive E. coli to oxidative stress was shown to be strain-dependent. The susceptibility of S. aureus to oxidative stress when grown in LSMMG has also been previously investigated: compared to normal gravity growth, S. aureus cells isolated from simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased sensitivity to challenge with H2O2, which was demonstrated to be related to decreased carotenoid (yellow membrane pigment) production under this growth condition. These previously-published studies, in conjunction with the S. mutans results presented here, clearly demonstrate that the microgravity model used, growth phase at which oxidative stress is tested, and/or other inherent species and strain-dependent differences, make it difficult to discern broad conclusions regarding the effect of the LSMMG on oxidative stress resistance.",

            "text": "Although direct comparisons cannot be extrapolated due to time point differences between the 8 h RNA-seq data (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4) and 16 h oxidative stress data (Fig. 5c), it is interesting to note that the 8 h simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes previously-shown to be involved in the response to oxidative stress in S. mutans. These included lrgA, which encodes a predicted holin-like protein, dpr, encoding an iron-binding protein that reduces the intracellular free iron pool during oxidative stress, and rex. As well, S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased expression of genes encoding phosphotransacetylase (Pta; SMU_1043c) and two putative acetate kinase (Act) genes (ackA and SMU_1299c), involved in the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate to acetate, respectively. In S. mutans, aspects of the Pta-Ack pathway have been shown to influence the cellular response to oxidative stress resistance. These results suggest that the simulated microgravity HARV cultures may be experiencing an oxidative-like stress response in early stationary phase (8 h growth), and the altered expression of these oxidative-stress related genes and metabolic pathways is perhaps occurring in response to this stress. Further support for the idea that the S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures may be experiencing more inherent stress relative to the normal gravity cultures stems from the observation that TA system genes mazEF and relBE were significantly upregulated during simulated microgravity growth (Fig. 4 and Supplemental File S4). MazF and RelE have been shown in several bacteria to selectively inhibit translation by cleaving specific mRNA recognition sequences in response to nutritional stress [reviewed in]. These data collectively suggest that S. mutans simulated microgravity HARV cultures display characteristics associated with stationary phase cellular stress. However, it is not clear from this data whether these cultures are experiencing overlapping simultaneous stresses (such as oxidative and starvation stress), or if the sum of these phenotype and gene expression changes represent a stress response specific to LSMMG.",

S. mutans displays an altered cell aggregation phenotype under simulated microgravity conditions: Micro-organisms such as Micrococcus luteus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, and Candida albicans  have all displayed increased biofilm growth when grown in either ground-based simulated and/or space flight microgravity conditions. In some instances, this biofilm increase was paralleled by documented increases in expression of biofilm-promoting regulatory genes or adhesion factors. Given these observations in other micro-organisms, we predicted that S. mutans would also display an increase in biofilm formation when grown in HARV microgravity cultures. Although biofilms attached to a solid surface were not assessed in these studies, macroscopic differences in cell–cell aggregation were typically observed in simulated microgravity compared to normal gravity HARV cultures at stationary phase (8 h growth; Fig. 2), suggesting that cell–cell adhesion and/or biofilm-like properties of this bacterium were altered in response to simulated microgravity growth. Although cell aggregation was observed in both the normal gravity and simulated microgravity HARV cultures grown in biofilm-promoting media containing sucrose, the simulated microgravity cell aggregates were more compact and more difficult to disrupt relative to the aggregates formed during normal gravity growth. Follow-up studies will be required to better characterize the structural properties of these cell aggregates (i.e. production of sucrose-dependent exopolysaccharide) and whether they are actually similar to biofilms that form on hydroxyapatite in vitro and/or the tooth surface in vivo. However, it is noteworthy that altered cell aggregation and/or “attachment-independent” phenotypes have also been observed in other biofilm-forming microbes in both LSMMG and during spaceflight. ",

Furthermore, these studies may provide insight into the response of S. mutans to low-fluid shear encountered in the oral cavity. Our future research efforts will focus on assessing S. mutans biofilm formation during simulated microgravity growth using culture conditions more closely mimicking the oral cavity (i.e., artificial saliva media and periodic pulsing of sucrose addition), as well as growth of S. mutans as part of a mixed-species biofilm consortium.",

In brief, each RNA sample was subjected to an mRNA enrichment step and generation of a library of cDNA template molecules of known strand origin using the TruSeq Total mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, generating 2 × 100 bp read lengths for a total of 2 × 10 M reads per sample. Illumina CASAVA software was used to create genomic builds and count reads, whereas TopHat-2.0.8b and Cufflinks-2.0.1 were used to align reads to the S. mutans UA159 genome (Genbank accession # NC_004350.2). ﻿All RNA-seq data have been deposited to NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE90166.﻿",
