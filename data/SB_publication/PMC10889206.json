We investigated whether BMAT is required for immune reconstitution following injury. Male wild type (WBB6F1, WT) and BMAT-deficient WBB6F1/J-KitW/KitW-v/J (KitW/W-v) mice were lethally irradiated. Irradiation was followed by adoptive transfer of 1000 purified WT hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The extent of immune reconstitution in blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes in the irradiated mice was determined using HSCs from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mice. We also evaluated skeletal response to treatment. Detection of GFP-positive B and T cells in peripheral blood at 4 and 9 weeks following adoptive transfer and in bone marrow and lymph nodes following necropsy revealed excellent immune reconstitution in both WT and BMAT-deficient mice. Adipocytes were numerous in the distal femur of WT mice but absent or rare in KitW/W-v mice. Bone parameters, including length, mass, density, bone volume, microarchitecture, and turnover balance, exhibited few differences between WT and BMAT-deficient mice. The minimal differences suggest that BMAT is not required for reconstitution of the immune system following lethal radiation and is not a major contributor to the skeletal phenotypes of kit signaling-deficient mice.",

            "text": "Bone marrow fat is an important depot for short- and long-duration storage of triglycerides. By middle age, bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) in humans typically contributes 5–10% of total body adipose tissue. Fat depots generally act as dynamic energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although BMAT can be highly labile, in contrast to white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow adipocytes often increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during energy deprivation, implying that the bone marrow fat depot does not necessarily function as a traditional energy reservoir for peripheral tissues.",

We previously reviewed evidence that increased BMAT during fasting reflects an adaptive response to a negative energy balance. An increase in BMAT and the resulting reduction in hematopoietic compartment size during long-duration fasting potentially promotes survival by lowering the energy expenditure required to maintain the turnover of hematopoietic cells. In support, age-related increases in BMAT and decreases in hematopoiesis are reversed by cold temperature stress, blood loss, and infection, conditions with increased requirement for hematopoiesis.",

In addition to regulating hematopoietic cell compartment size, it is possible that lipolysis of triglycerides stored in BMAT provides an energy source for hematopoietic cells. In this regard, Li et al. concluded that BMAT is essential for recovery of the hematopoietic system and bone following exposure to an energy deficit, injury, or high-dose ionizing radiation.",

These include two mouse strains (KitSl/Sld and KitW/W-v having defects in expression of kit ligand and kit receptor, respectively), that do not accrue BMAT in their long bones or lumbar vertebrae. Using female KitW/W-v mice, we showed that the well-established increase in BMAT following ovariectomy had no effect on bone loss. In contrast, BMAT deficiency in male KitW/W-v mice was associated with enhanced bone loss during hindlimb unloading, suggesting BMAT had a protective action. However, KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mouse strains have bone marrow and skeletal abnormalities that could be due to BMAT-independent effects of kit signaling deficiency. To address this limitation, we have refined the BMAT-deficient mouse models by restoring kit signaling to select tissues, including bone.",

            "text": "KitW/W-v mice have a point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain that inactivates the kit receptor in one allele and a mutation in the other allele that prevents translocation of the enzyme from the cytoplasm to the cell surface. Consequently, activation of the kit receptor by a kit ligand is greatly reduced but sufficient to allow for survival. The kit ligand is produced in two forms, as membrane-bound and as soluble. The Sl mutation in KitSl/Sld mice deletes the entire Sl (kit ligand) gene whereas the Steel-Dickie (Sld) mutation, resulting from an intragenic 4-kb deletion, removes sequences encoding transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, limiting expression of the gene to produce only a soluble form of kit ligand.",

The differences between Kit signaling-deficient KitW/W-v and KitSl/Sld mice and WT controls reported in the literature contrast with the minimal differences at cancellous bone sites reported in this study following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs to normalize kit signaling.

In the present study, we confirmed that rescue of kit signaling in KitW/W-v mice following adoptive transfer of WT HSCs does not result in the accrual of BMAT in the femur. On the other hand, normalization of kit signaling equalized many of the divergent bone parameters typically observed between WT and KitW/W-v mice. This latter finding argues in favor of defective HSC differentiation as the primary cause for the skeletal abnormalities in kit signaling-deficient mice.

            "text": "There is strong in vitro evidence that adipocytes support the long-term survival of hematopoietic lineage cells via kit signaling and a recent study concluded that lipolysis from BMAT is required to fuel bone cells and the marrow niche following energy deficits or injury. However, weight loss due to a chronic energy deficit has highly variable effects on BMAT levels in humans as well as experimental animals. Decreased weight due to involuntary caloric restriction often, but not always, leads to an increase in BMAT. In contrast, weight loss resulting from increased hypothalamic leptin levels results in no change or decreased BMAT. Additionally, the effects of injury induced by exposure to ionizing radiation on bone marrow adiposity are highly variable, ranging from no change to large increases. This variability in response to irradiation may be due to radiation dose, skeletal site evaluated, or timing of measurement. The latter is likely important because high doses of ionizing radiation result in a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density followed by gradual recovery. Specifically, following a whole-body dose of 137Cs (6 Gy), bone marrow cell density declined by 77% after 1 day and 86% after 3 days. However, by 2 weeks post irradiation, recovery was well underway. Importantly, the effect of radiation on cells was not uniform; while total marrow cell numbers declined drastically post irradiation, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter increased. Furthermore, neither bone marrow collapse nor early-stage recovery (2 weeks) was accompanied by increased BMAT. In contrast, we observed increased BMAT following a longer duration (8 week) recovery post lethal irradiation. Taken together, these findings suggest BMAT levels are a marker of recovery and argue against the hypothesis that energy stored in BMAT is critical to support bone marrow recovery following radiation-induced injury.",

Despite the absence of BMAT, the reconstitution of lymphocyte cell populations in the present study with only 1000 donor GFP-expressing cells was similar in WT and BMAT-deficient KitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice are mast cell-deficient, and we detected mast cells on bone surfaces in these mice following the adoptive transfer of WT HSCs, further supporting the successful restoration of normal hematopoietic cell differentiation. It is important to note that mesenchymal stem cells are radioresistant and, consequently, bone marrow cells expressing kit ligand are available to support hematopoiesis following irradiation.

Four µm thick sections were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and fixed to slides with a dried precoated 1% gelatin solution. Unstained slides were used for measurements of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, slides were stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA).",

Osteoclast perimeter was determined as a percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated cells with an acid phosphatase-positive (stained red) cytoplasm. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to a layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with bone. Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing.",
