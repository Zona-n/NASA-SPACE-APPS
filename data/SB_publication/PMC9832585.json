Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.",

There has been a strong track record of interactions between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - organizations that have been tasked with understanding mechanisms of radiation-induced biological damage and exploring pathways for the development of drugs to address radiation injuries. Past synergies have included co-sponsoring scientific meetings, co-funding research, and involvement through inter-agency grant/contract review teams and working groups. Several publications have resulted from these prior cooperative efforts. In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was established between NIH and NASA1 to formalize interactions with each organization establishing areas of cooperation, including the “development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space.” NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also signed an interagency agreement in 2018 to share innovative ideas for addressing science and technology challenges and to coordinate and collaborate on research that could improve human health on Earth and in space.2 Finally, since 2017 the NIAID/NASA Medical Countermeasures Working Group, with representation from NCI and other parts of HHS, has endeavored to rapidly and continually share information concerning research advances, to accelerate activities for all agencies.",

For example, NCI’s interest in radiation stems from the use of localized, high-dose, gamma, x-ray, or proton radiotherapy in cancer treatments. Since incidental damage to surrounding normal tissues can limit the amount of radiation therapy delivered to a tumor, developing approaches using short-term administration of radioprotectants that are not tumor-protective is essential. Additionally, since the time of radiation exposure is known during radiotherapy, it is possible to administer radioprotectors before irradiation.",

The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as possible immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. These outcomes also represent concerns for late effects of irradiation similar following a course of radiotherapy or after unanticipated low-dose exposures during a radiation incident. Characterization and mitigation of these risks require a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) high charge and energy (HZE) exposures and validation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in a relevant space environment. Although exposure levels are much lower than those used in radiotherapy, the duration of exposure is far longer. The intent of using mitigators is to prevent and/or reduce late effects thought to be associated with chronic, low doses of radiation. Thus, it is necessary to have products that are safe when dosed continuously because the time during a spaceflight when a harmful exposure may occur can be difficult to predict.",

To that end, the authors have attempted to identify radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and radiotherapies in their respective portfolios, to address NASA’s concerns in the care of astronauts exposed to radiation in long-duration space travel. It should be noted that the focus of the present work is on drugs with potential use to mitigate damage resulting from chronic, long-term exposures. Therefore, a discussion of approaches to minimize acute radiation syndrome (ARS) risks to astronauts from solar particle radiation is not considered in depth. A separate review addressing this area has been released by the NASA Human Research Program. Furthermore, gaps in each mission space are identified herein, and the need for shared approaches across these organizations to address them.",

Three key radiation-associated risks have also been outlined: 1) carcinogenesis; 2) cardiovascular disease and other degenerative tissue effects; and 3) acute (in-flight) and late central nervous system effects (e.g., changes in cognition, motor function, behavior, or neurological disorders). These risks also align well with those of NIAID and NCI. The primary challenges for NASA are to understand the severity of these risks in a space-relevant environment, evaluate MCMs that may provide radioprotection or mitigation, and identify biomarkers to indicate if/when an MCM may need to be administered during a mission. It is also imperative to determine any proposed MCM’s dosage, delivery, storage, and shelf-life since many space missions will have limited payload and refrigeration capacity. Therefore, selecting critical-need pharmaceuticals and identifying biomarkers to determine the timing of intervention and avoid treatment-related toxicities will be paramount. Continued interactions with NIH programs exploring therapeutics for normal tissue injuries will provide new approaches to be considered for astronaut health in a radiation environment.",

Several of these topics represent areas of overlap with NCI and NASA (e.g., minimization of normal tissue injuries, and biomarker identification). Another area of focus for NIAID, and a shared interest of NASA and NCI are the delayed effects of acute radiation exposure, including lung complications. NIAID has funded intramural studies at NCI on long-term health outcomes resulting from chronic, lower dose irradiation, since people could spend significant time in a lower dose, fallout environment after a nuclear incident. These findings can be used to anticipate potential outcomes following chronic exposures of NASA space flight personnel, and possible late effects in radiotherapy patients.

Since many patients suffer from adverse treatment effects, which could be acute, intermediate, or late, the RRP has supported predictive biomarker development, along with radioprotectors and mitigators to reduce treatment-related toxicities and improve patient outcomes. Cancer survivorship will expand with improvements in treatment, with one estimate suggesting >26 million cancer survivors by 2040. Establishment of tracking in these populations will provide an opportunity to study late radiation impacts, including second cancers and cardiovascular disease.

As defined by the NIH-FDA Biomarker Working Group in the joint document, BEST (Biomarkers, EndpointS, and other Tools) Resource,4 biomarkers are indicators of normal biological and pathogenic processes or responses to an exposure or intervention, including therapeutics. Biomarkers can be molecular, histologic, radiographic, or physiologic characteristics and do not necessarily assess how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Molecular patterns, gene expression profiles, and miRNA signatures have been explored for possible use in radiation dose reconstruction, disease prognosis, prediction of radiation sensitivity, and use in medical triage. In addition, study of biomarkers to determine if and when MCMs should be administered during a radiation emergency also inform on exposures during a spaceflight mission, and may reduce the need to take prophylactic MCMs and allow appropriate medical intervention. Biomarkers could also help determine individual sensitivity from radiation exposure and guide both determination of fitness for radiation exposure (e.g., during therapy or space flight), and precise delivery of MCMs for each victim, radiotherapy patient or space crew member. To this end, NASA, NCI and NIAID have worked together to explore different models for radiation-induced injuries, such as hematopoietic, cutaneous, lung, and late carcinogenic endpoints.",

For example, cancer risks in the A-bomb lifespan study cohort continue to rise throughout life; however, clearly defining carcinogenic risks from low-dose irradiation has been challenging A literature review published by NCI researchers within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics considered studies with mean radiation doses less than 100 mGy and found an excess relative risk of greater than 1.0 for most solid cancers and leukemia. This is consistent with the recent million-person study of U.S. radiation workers and atomic veterans that suggests leukemia and lung cancer risks are lower from chronic than acute exposures, and that low-level radiation exposures are associated with circulatory diseases. NIAID has supported epidemiology work carried out by NCI researchers on health effects in Marshall Islanders exposed to the fallout following the Castle Bravo nuclear test, individuals exposed during Nevada Atomic Testing, and the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site, and exposed populations living near Chernobyl. These studies have contributed to a better understanding of how persistent, low-dose exposures can be harmful. Because it is difficult to assess the long-term impact of space radiation on flight personnel, these studies assessing late effects resulting from exposure to other forms of radiation provide insight into what could be experienced by astronauts after returning from long duration space missions. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory has been expanded through development of a galactic cosmic rays (GCR) facility designed to provide a mixed spectrum of ion beams to simulate the space radiation environment. NSRL provides researchers the ability to conduct high-LET, mixed field radiation studies on the ground, to better understand space radiation effects on biology. understand space radiation effects and perform long-terms animal studies under controlled conditions. While NSRL can provide access to high-LET mixed field exposures, the dose-rate expected in space is significantly lower than the facility can provide, hence, the ideal exposure scenario will be conducted on future Artemis missions designed to take astronauts to the lunar surface, Gateway, and beyond.",

However, exposure to stressors such as radiation can trigger an imbalance in free radical generation and their removal, leading to DNA damage, with the potential to induce early and late effects. It has been established that radiation exposure in all its forms leads to an immediate and chronic state of oxidative stress. The interaction of radiation with water molecules within the body leads to ROS generation, which, although short-lived, can wreak cellular havoc. Similarly, a chronic state of radiation-induced oxidative stress can lead to altered homeostasis, which can continue for many hours to months beyond initial exposure.

For example, in a human gastrointestinal (GI) cancer model, mice exposed to 28Si-ions and a diet supplemented with aspirin reported a significant reduction in a potent pro-inflammatory molecule but not a reduction in GI tumorigenesis. Another study assessed the ability of aspirin to protect mice exposed to a mixed field of neutrons and photons and a single or fractionated simulated GCR exposure. While data suggested that radiation-induced changes in systolic cardiac function and mitochondrial respiration were mitigated, aspirin did not benefit in preserving behavioral or cognitive performance.

Similarly, the role of senescent cells in radiation-associated aging of hematopoietic stem cells has led to the study of senolytic drugs as potential MCMs for ARS. While senescence is an essential tumor-suppressive phenomenon, senescent cells share hallmark features with cancer cells, including developing resistance to therapy, evasion of immune surveillance, and genomic instability. Thus, shared vulnerabilities of senescent cells with cancer cells could be exploited to develop novel approaches to prevent and mitigate carcinogenesis. A summary of senotherapeutics, including drug classes and developmental stage, mechanisms of action, critical knowledge gaps, pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities in their development as anticancer agents is available, and NIH has identified several broad areas as a blueprint in senescence research.

Other studies found that lovastatin could interfere with the development of lung complications after large doses of irradiation, and mitigate radiation-induced damage to the salivary gland in murine models. Simvastatin is undergoing clinical trial testing in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases, as a means of neuroprotection (NCT02104193).

Further, NASA has investigated use of minocycline as a prophylactic MCM due to its antibiotic, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. A second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been used clinically for decades, minocycline is considered a safe drug in humans. Work performed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) showed that ciprofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, improved survival and diminished symptoms in irradiated mice. It also improved neutrophil counts and function. In addition, ciprofloxacin enhanced recovery from hemorrhagic radiation proctitis in radiotherapy patients. Therefore, ciprofloxacin, with its ability to comprehensively modulate inflammation, immune signaling, and wound healing, has potential to mitigate radiation injuries arising from space-based exposures. Although this MCM could offer cross-risk protection for radiation-induced effects and the immune system to mitigate infection, it has been reported to increase intracranial hypertension, which would not be acceptable for the crew since this complication is a risk outlined in the Human Research Roadmap.

The level of FDA approval required for the NASA crew is determined by the NASA Office of Chief Health and Medical Officer. If an MCM shows promise as a radioprotector or a mitigator, it goes through the NASA Transition to Operations Review Process (TORP) to obtain approval for administration to crew for the demonstrated indication.11 Similar to, and in many ways patterned on FDA procedures, the TORP is designed to assess effectiveness and operational readiness of human health, human performance, and medical research and technology products and deliverables. These reviews require 1) a detailed description of the deliverable, its intended use, and a description of how it addresses a NASA-identified critical risk, medical, health, performance issues, or application; 2) data demonstrating efficacy or utility; 3) data demonstrating operational validation; 4) an implementation plan of how it is to be used or applied, 5) an analysis of mission resources necessary for implementation; and 6) a summary of developmental processes and milestones achieved. Similar to FDA Animal Rule approval, the NASA pathway requires extensive evidence in animal models, clinical safety data in humans and takes cues from the development of other radio-therapeutics, and is also based on traditional clinical approval processes used for NCI approaches.",

Fortunately, careful coordination between funding agencies and scientists in the field has enabled the advancement of many approaches that could be useful for both NIH and NASA needs. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Although exposures may be limited due to shorter flight times, people in the general population will still be exposed to space radiation during these flights. As there are diverse tissue-specific cancer risk rankings across sex and race, including sex-specific organ risks, all of these factors will need to be considered as more people take these flights. Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies’ mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights. Similarly, advances made by NASA and their funded investigators can help NIH in their efforts to address radiotherapy complications and protection of civilians from other unintended radiation exposures.",

Research supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) provided much of the early findings on identifying cellular pathways involved in radiation injuries, due to the need to push the boundaries to kill tumor cells while minimizing damage to intervening normal tissues. By protecting normal tissue surrounding the tumors, physicians can deliver a higher radiation dose to tumors and reduce adverse effects related to the treatment. Initially relying on this critical NCI research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), first tasked with developing radiation medical countermeasures in 2004, has provided bridge funding to move basic research toward advanced development and translation. The goal of the NIAID program is to fund approaches that can one day be employed to protect civilian populations during a radiological or nuclear incident. In addition, with the reality of long-term space flights and the possibility of radiation exposures to both acute, high-intensity, and chronic lower-dose levels, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has identified requirements to discover and develop radioprotectors and mitigators to protect their astronauts during space missions. In sustained partnership with sister agencies, these three organizations must continue to leverage funding and findings in their overlapping research areas to accelerate biomarker identification and product development to help safeguard these different and yet undeniably similar human populations – cancer patients, public citizens, and astronauts.",

There has been a strong track record of interactions between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), including the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - organizations that have been tasked with understanding mechanisms of radiation-induced biological damage and exploring pathways for the development of drugs to address radiation injuries. Past synergies have included co-sponsoring scientific meetings, co-funding research, and involvement through inter-agency grant/contract review teams and working groups. Several publications have resulted from these prior cooperative efforts. In 2007, a memorandum of understanding was established between NIH and NASA1 to formalize interactions with each organization establishing areas of cooperation, including the “development of biomedical research approaches and clinical technologies for use on Earth and in space.” NASA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also signed an interagency agreement in 2018 to share innovative ideas for addressing science and technology challenges and to coordinate and collaborate on research that could improve human health on Earth and in space.2 Finally, since 2017 the NIAID/NASA Medical Countermeasures Working Group, with representation from NCI and other parts of HHS, has endeavored to rapidly and continually share information concerning research advances, to accelerate activities for all agencies.",

For example, NCI’s interest in radiation stems from the use of localized, high-dose, gamma, x-ray, or proton radiotherapy in cancer treatments. Since incidental damage to surrounding normal tissues can limit the amount of radiation therapy delivered to a tumor, developing approaches using short-term administration of radioprotectants that are not tumor-protective is essential. Additionally, since the time of radiation exposure is known during radiotherapy, it is possible to administer radioprotectors before irradiation.",

The primary risks of concern include carcinogenesis, central nervous system (CNS) effects resulting in potential in-mission cognitive or behavioral impairment and/or late neurological disorders, degenerative tissue effects including circulatory and heart disease, as well as possible immune system decrements impacting multiple aspects of crew health. These outcomes also represent concerns for late effects of irradiation similar following a course of radiotherapy or after unanticipated low-dose exposures during a radiation incident. Characterization and mitigation of these risks require a significant reduction in the large biological uncertainties of chronic (low-dose rate) high charge and energy (HZE) exposures and validation of medical countermeasures (MCMs) in a relevant space environment. Although exposure levels are much lower than those used in radiotherapy, the duration of exposure is far longer. The intent of using mitigators is to prevent and/or reduce late effects thought to be associated with chronic, low doses of radiation. Thus, it is necessary to have products that are safe when dosed continuously because the time during a spaceflight when a harmful exposure may occur can be difficult to predict.",

Because it is impossible to predict when these exposures will occur, use of prophylactic (pre-exposure products is not feasible; therefore, drugs that can mitigate (given post-irradiation but before symptoms manifest) or treat (given after clinically detectable injury) are of greatest interest. Like the NCI, high doses of radiation are of concern; however, the exposures are anticipated to be nearly total-body.

To that end, the authors have attempted to identify radioprotectors, radiomitigators, and radiotherapies in their respective portfolios, to address NASA’s concerns in the care of astronauts exposed to radiation in long-duration space travel. It should be noted that the focus of the present work is on drugs with potential use to mitigate damage resulting from chronic, long-term exposures. Therefore, a discussion of approaches to minimize acute radiation syndrome (ARS) risks to astronauts from solar particle radiation is not considered in depth. A separate review addressing this area has been released by the NASA Human Research Program. Furthermore, gaps in each mission space are identified herein, and the need for shared approaches across these organizations to address them.",

Three key radiation-associated risks have also been outlined: 1) carcinogenesis; 2) cardiovascular disease and other degenerative tissue effects; and 3) acute (in-flight) and late central nervous system effects (e.g., changes in cognition, motor function, behavior, or neurological disorders). These risks also align well with those of NIAID and NCI. The primary challenges for NASA are to understand the severity of these risks in a space-relevant environment, evaluate MCMs that may provide radioprotection or mitigation, and identify biomarkers to indicate if/when an MCM may need to be administered during a mission. It is also imperative to determine any proposed MCM’s dosage, delivery, storage, and shelf-life since many space missions will have limited payload and refrigeration capacity. Therefore, selecting critical-need pharmaceuticals and identifying biomarkers to determine the timing of intervention and avoid treatment-related toxicities will be paramount. Continued interactions with NIH programs exploring therapeutics for normal tissue injuries will provide new approaches to be considered for astronaut health in a radiation environment.",

Molecular patterns, gene expression profiles, and miRNA signatures have been explored for possible use in radiation dose reconstruction, disease prognosis, prediction of radiation sensitivity, and use in medical triage. In addition, study of biomarkers to determine if and when MCMs should be administered during a radiation emergency also inform on exposures during a spaceflight mission, and may reduce the need to take prophylactic MCMs and allow appropriate medical intervention. Biomarkers could also help determine individual sensitivity from radiation exposure and guide both determination of fitness for radiation exposure (e.g., during therapy or space flight), and precise delivery of MCMs for each victim, radiotherapy patient or space crew member.

For example, cancer risks in the A-bomb lifespan study cohort continue to rise throughout life; however, clearly defining carcinogenic risks from low-dose irradiation has been challenging A literature review published by NCI researchers within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics considered studies with mean radiation doses less than 100 mGy and found an excess relative risk of greater than 1.0 for most solid cancers and leukemia. This is consistent with the recent million-person study of U.S. radiation workers and atomic veterans that suggests leukemia and lung cancer risks are lower from chronic than acute exposures, and that low-level radiation exposures are associated with circulatory diseases. NIAID has supported epidemiology work carried out by NCI researchers on health effects in Marshall Islanders exposed to the fallout following the Castle Bravo nuclear test, individuals exposed during Nevada Atomic Testing, and the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site, and exposed populations living near Chernobyl. These studies have contributed to a better understanding of how persistent, low-dose exposures can be harmful. Because it is difficult to assess the long-term impact of space radiation on flight personnel, these studies assessing late effects resulting from exposure to other forms of radiation provide insight into what could be experienced by astronauts after returning from long duration space missions. The NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory has been expanded through development of a galactic cosmic rays (GCR) facility designed to provide a mixed spectrum of ion beams to simulate the space radiation environment. NSRL provides researchers the ability to conduct high-LET, mixed field radiation studies on the ground, to better understand space radiation effects on biology. understand space radiation effects and perform long-terms animal studies under controlled conditions. While NSRL can provide access to high-LET mixed field exposures, the dose-rate expected in space is significantly lower than the facility can provide, hence, the ideal exposure scenario will be conducted on future Artemis missions designed to take astronauts to the lunar surface, Gateway, and beyond.",

The interaction of radiation with water molecules within the body leads to ROS generation, which, although short-lived, can wreak cellular havoc. Similarly, a chronic state of radiation-induced oxidative stress can lead to altered homeostasis, which can continue for many hours to months beyond initial exposure. This oxidant injury is non-specific, with all intracellular elements (e.g., proteins, lipids, carbohydrates) subject to the damage.",

Dietary supplementation with Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors derived from soybeans, L-selenomethionine, or a combination of selected antioxidant agents has shown promise to prevent the decrease in antioxidants in the plasma of mice exposed to proton or HZE particle radiation. Adding nutritional foods, such as blueberries, to crew diets may provide added benefits to help reduce ROS and mitigate radiation-induced CNS effects, as reported in animal studies using space-relevant radiation exposures. In one study, feeding dried plums to mice mitigated radiation-induced loss of bone and demonstrated potential as a radiomitigator for protons and HZE particle radiation.

Another study assessed the ability of aspirin to protect mice exposed to a mixed field of neutrons and photons and a single or fractionated simulated GCR exposure. While data suggested that radiation-induced changes in systolic cardiac function and mitochondrial respiration were mitigated, aspirin did not benefit in preserving behavioral or cognitive performance.

Senescent cells display specific molecular, biochemical, and morphological features, and cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy induce senescence in both normal and cancer cells. Because of an increased understanding of multiple roles in cancer, cellular senescence is a vital target in the fight against cancer. Similarly, the role of senescent cells in radiation-associated aging of hematopoietic stem cells has led to the study of senolytic drugs as potential MCMs for ARS. While senescence is an essential tumor-suppressive phenomenon, senescent cells share hallmark features with cancer cells, including developing resistance to therapy, evasion of immune surveillance, and genomic instability. Thus, shared vulnerabilities of senescent cells with cancer cells could be exploited to develop novel approaches to prevent and mitigate carcinogenesis. A summary of senotherapeutics, including drug classes and developmental stage, mechanisms of action, critical knowledge gaps, pitfalls, challenges, and opportunities in their development as anticancer agents is available, and NIH has identified several broad areas as a blueprint in senescence research. In the context of radiation, the effects of dose, dose rate, radiation type, and the response kinetics of cellular senescence have not been fully understood.",

They offer cross-risk mitigation due to their pleiotropic effects that target neuroprotection, antioxidant modulation, and effects on anti-inflammatory pathways. In studies where atorvastatin was delivered chronically, there was minimal radiation mitigation; however, when combined with an ACE inhibitor (ramipril), the two drugs mitigated radiation-induced disruption of neurogenic signaling. Other studies found that lovastatin could interfere with the development of lung complications after large doses of irradiation, and mitigate radiation-induced damage to the salivary gland in murine models. Simvastatin is undergoing clinical trial testing in patients receiving radiation therapy for brain metastases, as a means of neuroprotection (NCT02104193). Available human data on statins suggests a radioprotective mechanism in reducing GI toxicity; however, a Danish study looking at the risk of statin use reported an increase in ovarian mucinous tumors associated with their use. In addition, there is an established link between adverse side effects and statin use, which could interfere with the ability of NASA personnel to carry out flight tasks.10 Nevertheless, given the benefits and proven long-term use of statins, NASA could consider this MCM when planning studies to evaluate radioprotectors and mitigators.",

They have demonstrated efficacy in attenuating ARS, with antimicrobials such as tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones showing promise as radiation mitigators. Antibiotics such as minocycline are also in clinical trials as neuroprotective treatments for patients undergoing metastatic brain tumor radiotherapy. Further, NASA has investigated use of minocycline as a prophylactic MCM due to its antibiotic, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. A second-generation, semi-synthetic tetracycline that has been used clinically for decades, minocycline is considered a safe drug in humans. Work performed by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) showed that ciprofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, improved survival and diminished symptoms in irradiated mice. It also improved neutrophil counts and function. In addition, ciprofloxacin enhanced recovery from hemorrhagic radiation proctitis in radiotherapy patients. Therefore, ciprofloxacin, with its ability to comprehensively modulate inflammation, immune signaling, and wound healing, has potential to mitigate radiation injuries arising from space-based exposures. Although this MCM could offer cross-risk protection for radiation-induced effects and the immune system to mitigate infection, it has been reported to increase intracranial hypertension, which would not be acceptable for the crew since this complication is a risk outlined in the Human Research Roadmap. NASA should explore discussions with Human Health and Countermeasure (HHC) experts regarding this issue and investigate doses associated with intracranial hypertension.",

Despite this different process, there is information to be gained by NASA through understanding the standard, NCI approach for therapies and the NIAID use of the FDA Animal Rule (21 CFR 314.600–650 for drugs; 21 CFR 601.90–95 for biologics), which was heavily influenced by the traditional clinical approval pathways used by NCI, and covers MCMs for which “human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible”.

These reviews require 1) a detailed description of the deliverable, its intended use, and a description of how it addresses a NASA-identified critical risk, medical, health, performance issues, or application; 2) data demonstrating efficacy or utility; 3) data demonstrating operational validation; 4) an implementation plan of how it is to be used or applied, 5) an analysis of mission resources necessary for implementation; and 6) a summary of developmental processes and milestones achieved. Similar to FDA Animal Rule approval, the NASA pathway requires extensive evidence in animal models, clinical safety data in humans and takes cues from the development of other radio-therapeutics, and is also based on traditional clinical approval processes used for NCI approaches.",

Fortunately, careful coordination between funding agencies and scientists in the field has enabled the advancement of many approaches that could be useful for both NIH and NASA needs. Looking to the future, commercial space tourism is already a reality for sub-orbital flights and low-earth orbits, with private astronaut missions to the International Space Station currently underway, and moon trips expected during the next few decades. Although exposures may be limited due to shorter flight times, people in the general population will still be exposed to space radiation during these flights. As there are diverse tissue-specific cancer risk rankings across sex and race, including sex-specific organ risks, all of these factors will need to be considered as more people take these flights. Continued collaboration between organizations tasked with developing approaches to address radiation-induced injuries will ensure that products with the greatest promise are studied across all agencies’ mission-specific requirements and that human health will be well-addressed by NASA for their future long-term space flights. Similarly, advances made by NASA and their funded investigators can help NIH in their efforts to address radiotherapy complications and protection of civilians from other unintended radiation exposures.",
