The purpose of this review is to describe current understanding of microgravity and radiation impacts on the mammalian skeleton and associated vasculature at the level of the whole organism. Recent experiments from spaceflight and ground-based models have provided fresh insights into how these environmental stresses influence mechanisms that are related to redox signaling, oxidative stress, and tissue dysfunction. Emerging mechanistic knowledge on cellular defenses to radiation and other environmental stressors, including microgravity, are useful for both screening and developing interventions against spaceflight-induced deficits in bone and vascular function.",

Microgravity leads to a cephalad fluid shift and profound reductions in mechanical loading of bone and muscle. Spaceflight causes perturbations in calcium homeostasis and site-specific reductions in bone mass (osteopenia), and thus may pose long-term risks for skeletal health and tissue repair. In rodent models of weightlessness such as hindlimb unloading (HU), the onset of osteopenia correlates with reductions in skeletal perfusion, vascular density (rarefication), and vasodilation responses similar to that observed in aging. These are serious risks for long-duration, exploration-class missions when astronauts will face the challenges of increased exposure to space radiation and abrupt transitions between different gravitational states upon return to Earth.",

            "text": "Spaceflight and the return to Earth may lead to oxidative damage in blood and various tissues as a result of excessive reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in both humans and animals. Collectively, a number of studies indicate that various tissues undergo altered redox status during and/or after spaceflight. Urinary excretion of the oxidative damage markers, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured in-flight (88 to 186 days in orbit) and post-flight (up to 14 days) in Mir mission crew. The isoprostane, 8-iso-PGF2α, is a marker for oxidative damage to membrane lipids and is produced by the peroxidation of arachidonic acid in membrane phospholipids while 8-OHdG is an oxidized derivative of the nucleoside, deoxyguanosine, and is therefore used to assess oxidative damage to DNA. 8-OHdG excretion was unchanged during spaceflight and increased postflight. No changes in 8-OHdG levels were observed in Earth-based individuals that underwent bed rest although isoprostane was increased in the ensuing recovery period. Changes in isoprostane production were attributed to decreased generation of oxygen radicals from the electron transport chain due to reduced caloric intake in-flight, whereas the post-flight increases in the excretion of oxidative damage markers may be partly caused by a combination of increased metabolic activity following flight and the loss of some antioxidant defenses during flight. The downregulation of antioxidant defenses as a potential mechanism for the increased levels of oxidative damage post-flight is supported by the observation that hair follicle samples from International Space Station (ISS) crew members at post-flight display decreased expression of endogenous antioxidant genes, including Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), the regulator of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2 a.k.a.

In rats, short-duration spaceflight (6 days) increases cardiac gene expression of mitochondrial redox-related enzymes, suggesting a possible stress response and/or change in energy metabolism. Although short duration spaceflight (7 days) does not alter heart mass in rats, differences between flight and ground controls were observed in the vasculature of mice. Spaceflight induces similar effects in the liver of both rats and mice, which includes elevated expression levels of antioxidant genes and markers of oxidative damage. Male rats flown in STS-63 for eight days showed reduced total glutathione (GSH) content and activities of CuZnSOD (SOD1), catalase, GSH reductase, and GSH sulfur-transferase in liver. In ocular tissue, astronauts are susceptible to optic disc edema, globe flattening, and choroidal fold formation. The mechanisms are unknown, although mice flown in STS-135 also showed ocular tissue damage as well as alterations in several critical genes involved in regulating vascular endothelial cell response to oxidative stress and apoptosis.",

O2− can be generated by exposure of cells to ionizing irradiation and as a by-product of metabolism, primarily from mitochondria. O2− is an upstream component of many oxidative pathways and can be rapidly converted into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by members of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) family of antioxidants. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and other peroxidases such as peroxiredoxin then convert H2O2 into H2O. H2O2 can react with endogenous Fe2+ or other transition metals via a fenton mechanism to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical (OH•) which is one of the most damaging free radical species produced by exposure to ionizing radiation.",

The embryonic skeleton undergoes endochondral ossification (reviewed in) where cartilage, an avascular tissue, is gradually converted into bone, one of the most vascularized tissues in vertebrates. This process occurs through a series of complex and coordinated signals that induce terminal differentiation of chondrocytes and their subsequent death. The extracellular matrix produced by the chondrocytes is then mineralized and partly degraded by chondroclasts and preosteoclasts, thus promoting the invasion of blood vessels. Following vascular invasion, osteogenic progenitors are recruited to the site, where they form mineralized bone. A similar mechanism occurs during postnatal growth of the long bones, fracture repair and bone remodeling, although smaller in scale than what occurs during development. There is evidence that re-vascularization in response to bone injury is impaired in spaceflight. Rats that underwent osteotomy and then exposed to microgravity display reduced angiogenesis at the site of injury.

A majority of astronauts experience orthostatic intolerance upon return from long-duration flight (129–190 days) which is attributed to impairments in raising peripheral resistance. Muscle vasculature plays an integral role in elevating peripheral resistance and, therefore, has been the subject of a number of studies using spaceflight models. In rodents, both spaceflight and hindlimb unloading impair vasoconstriction of gastrocnemius resistance arteries. In addition, resistance arteries of mouse gastrocnemius and rat soleus both display defects in endothelium-dependent vasodilation. In rats, the soleus resistance arteries exhibit diminished expression levels of eNOS and SOD1, although the gastrocnemius resistance arteries do not show such alterations. The basis for the site-specific differences in redox status of vascular resistance arteries is not fully understood. However, there is speculation that this is partly due to region-specific differences in perfusion and/or differences in metabolic rates of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers and the relative abundance of these fiber types in the two muscle sites.",

Under normal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered to the cytosol via binding to its inhibitor, KEAP1, and is therefore subject to proteosomal degradation. During conditions of excess ROS, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1 and undergoes translocation into the nucleus.

Similarly, ex vivo osteoclast cultures from NRF2 KOs mature faster than those from wild-type animals, although in vivo osteoclast counts are unchanged. In contrast, NRF2 deletion in male rodents leads to higher bone mass, mineral apposition rate and osteoblast number compared to wild-type controls. These sex-dependent differences were corroborated in a more rigorous study comparing male and female NRF2 KOs. NRF2 deficiency in females results in reduced femoral and spinal bone mineral density, while loss of NRF2 in males leads to an improvement in the said bone structural parameters compared to sex-matched controls.

            "text": "Within a period of three days to a month, relatively low doses of radiation (≤2 Gy) lead to progressive loss of cancellous bone, as shown by our group and others, which is preceeded by a rapid increase in expression levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and TNFα and pro-osteoclastogenic signals RANKL and MCP1 as well as the oxidative defense gene, NRF2. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that diets or drugs capable of preventing early increases in these molecular signals can mitigate cancellous bone loss caused by both low LET and high LET radiation. The hypothesis was tested by evaluating a number of candidate interventions including: (1) an antioxidant diet cocktail (AOX) composed of N-acetyl cysteine, ascorbic acid, l-selenomethionine, dihydrolipoic acid and vitamin E which in combination has been shown to protect a variety of tissues from ionizing radiation; (2) dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), which possesses antioxidant properties; (3) the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Ibuprofen; and (4) Dried Plum (DP, 25% by weight), previously reported to inhibit osteoclast activity and protect from age-related bone loss. Findings from this study indicate that high levels of pro-resorptive, pro-inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related genes in bone marrow strongly correlate with cancellous bone loss. DP diet completely prevents radiation-induced increases in these molecular signals and the ensuing cancellous bone loss which appears to strengthen the rationale for using antioxidants to mitigate radiation-induced bone loss. However, seemingly paradoxical is that the other two antioxidant-based interventions, DHLA and AOX, failed to protect from bone loss induced by radiation. These findings do not nullify the feasibility of using antioxidants as a countermeasure, yet highlight very important considerations in countermeasure design for radiation-induced bone loss. Firstly, an effective strategy to mitigate radiation-induced bone loss must at least include components that prevent the early rise in expression of pro-resorptive, pro-inflammatory, and oxidative stress-related genes. This knowledge is gained from the observation that treatments which fail to mitigate the changes in all these three molecular signals (such as AOX and Ibuprofen) ultimately were unsuccessful in preventing radiation-induced bone loss. Secondly, there are additional, equally important signaling molecules likely to mediate radiation-induced bone loss. This is a lesson learned from the finding that DHLA, which appeared nearly as effective as DP in preventing radiation-induced increases in expression of these markers, did not protect skeletal microarchitecture. Lastly, an assessment of the efficacy of an intervention on multiple organ systems must be incorporated in countermeasure development efforts as antioxidants appear to confer various levels of protection in different tissues.",

            "text": "Studies overwhelmingly demonstrate a link between oxidative damage and tissue dysfunction that ensues from exposure to spaceflight factors (Figure 1). One of the outstanding questions that needs to be addressed is whether oxidative damage mediates or results from progressive tissue degeneration in the course of spaceflight. More studies using genetic models for altered redox status will contribute to resolving this question. Future interplanetary travel will increase the duration of exposure of humans to spaceflight. Therefore, additional comprehensive investigations involving extended timepoints that simulate the duration of long-term missions and the ensuing recovery must be conducted to better estimate health risks to crew. Furthermore, the latent effects of spaceflight on the cardiovascular system and on stem and progenitor cells of the bone marrow must be examined for their potential to exacerbate the effects of aging. The use of antioxidant-based countermeasures must be guided by the understanding that low levels of ROS signaling are important for normal cellular function. Therefore, future studies must also assess the potential of any antioxidant-based countermeasure to perturb these essential signaling events and their consequences on the functional integrity of tissues. Research progress on the aformentioned areas will help in the development of effective approaches for maintaining crew health during and after interplanetary missions.",

            "text": "Hypothetical model on how spaceflight leads to deficits in tissue function and structural integrity. Exposure of tissues to elements of the spaceflight environment such as microgravity and radiation (and potentially other unknown factors) leads to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (NOS), increased levels of pro-inflammatory signals, and downregulation of endogenous antioxidant defenses. This leads to excess ROS/NOS due to an imbalance between endogenous antioxidant protein levels and ROS/NOS production. Excess ROS/NOS leads to oxidative damage of proteins, lipids and DNA which in turn result in deficits in tissue function and structural integrity. Other non-redox signaling processes may also contribute to these deficits. Some exogenous antioxidants found in the diet may block the increases in ROS/NOS levels and inflammatory signals, thereby preventing oxidative damage. It remains to be elucidated whether inflammation causes ROS production and/or vice versa in the context of spaceflight, and whether oxidative damage mediates or results from progressive tissue degeneration as a consequence of spaceflight. T-bar arrow: inhibitory effect; dotted line arrow: cause and effect needs further elucidation. Gray arrows depict the contribution of non-redox related processes in spaceflight-induced deficits in tissue structure and function.",
