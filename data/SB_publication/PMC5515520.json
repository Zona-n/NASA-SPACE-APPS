            "text": "Our primary aim was to determine whether gravity has a direct role in establishing the auxin-mediated gravity-sensing system in primary roots. Major plant architectures have long been thought to be guided by gravity, including the directional growth of the primary root via auxin gradients that are then disturbed when roots deviate from the vertical as a gravity sensor. However, experiments on the International Space Station (ISS) now allow physical clarity with regard to any assumptions regarding the role of gravity in establishing fundamental root auxin distributions. We examined the spaceflight green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reporter gene expression in roots of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana: pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, pSCR::SCR–GFP to monitor auxin and pARR5::GFP to monitor cytokinin. Plants on the ISS were imaged live with the Light Microscopy Module (LMM), and compared with control plants imaged on the ground. Preserved spaceflight and ground control plants were examined post flight with confocal microscopy. Plants on orbit, growing in the absence of any physical reference to the terrestrial gravity vector, displayed typically “vertical” distribution of auxin in the primary root. This confirms that the establishment of the auxin-gradient system, the primary guide for gravity signaling in the root, is gravity independent. The cytokinin distribution in the root tip differs between spaceflight and the ground controls, suggesting spaceflight-induced features of root growth may be cytokinin related. The distribution of auxin in the gravity-sensing portion of the root is not dependent on gravity. Spaceflight appears benign to auxin and its role in the development of the primary root tip, whereas spaceflight may influence cytokinin-associated processes.",

            "text": "Since the times of the Darwins’ treatise on the power of movement in plants and the experiments of Cholodny and Went gravity has been established as central to many patterns of plant development. Gravity-dependent changes in root growth direction are keyed by changes in the auxin distribution within the root tip. During gravistimulation, starch-containing amyloplasts migrate to the downward side of the root columella cells, initiating migration of PIN proteins that then cause asymmetric redistribution of auxin toward the lower side of the root, which in turn causes curvature in the elongation zone to reestablish the root into a vertical orientation. This series of signaling events acts upon a well-characterized distribution of auxin that arises from a flow of auxin from the aerial portions of the plant through the central stele toward the root tip with an accumulation of auxin in the columella cells, which is then relieved by a flow back toward the aerial portions of the plant through the outer root cell layers. The movement and differential accumulation of auxin within specific root tip cells is known as the ‘reverse fountain’ model (Figure 1a). It is this auxin accumulation and flow that forms the primary basis of the root’s ability to respond to gravity. Implicit in model’s name is the notion that gravity establishes at least part of the pattern of distribution, just as drops from a water fountain fall after the propelling force is overcome by gravity. Most references to these gravity-driven responses compare “vertical” to “gravistimulated”, as if vertical is the ground state. The term vertical, defined as an orientation perpendicular to the plane of the horizon, inexorably creates an implicit relationship in which the fundamental auxin reverse fountain is established and oriented along the Earth’s gravity vector.",

            "text": "We wished to know whether gravity has a direct physiologic role in establishing the auxin reverse fountain signaling system in primary roots. One of the major values of work on the ISS is the ability to remove unit gravity from growth conditions. This allows a comparison with earthbound experiments with, for example, agravitropic mutants that imply that gravity sensing can be decoupled from the auxin flow. We used Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) lines expressing gravity signaling fluorescent reporter genes to examine the distribution of auxin and cytokinin in the primary roots of plants grown in two experiments on the International Space Station (ISS). We used the auxin artificial AuxRE promoter construct (pDR5r::GFP) as a gene expression level reporter of auxin levels throughout the root tip, especially in the central columella cells (C), and a Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis fusion (pTAA1::TAA1–GFP) to monitor auxin production in the Quiescent Center cells (QC). We used a Scarecrow fusion (pSCR::SCR–GFP), to monitor the scarecrow transcription factor, which has a regulatory role in auxin biosynthesis, to monitor auxin-related signals in the endodermal layer and QC. We similarly monitored free-cytokinin levels in root tips using the Arabidopsis Response Regulator promoter (pARR5::GFP) reporter, which is similarly distributed as the GUS reporter with the same promoter (pARR5::GUS).",

Auxin is synthesized in the QC cells, cells that are part of the stem cell niche (SCN) in the root apical meristem and that give rise to the gravity-sensing columella cells of the root tip (Figure 1a). The importance of this source of auxin to the gravity-sensing mechanism in roots is revealed by the fact excised root tips, without the auxin source of the reverse fountain, exhibit a response to gravity. We used the pTAA1::TAA1–GFP native promoter protein fusion reporter to monitor the amount of the auxin in these essential QC cells. TAA1 encodes an aminotransferase that regulates auxin biosynthesis within the QC cells, and contributes to gravitropic signaling. The TAA1::TAA1–GFP in 5-day and 8-day-old plants on orbit showed a distribution of GFP expression that was indistinguishable from similarly grown ground control plants (Figure 5a,b,e,f), and is consistent with what is typically expected in vertically grown plants.

SCR is essential to stem cell activity in the root apical meristem, the organization of the root cap and QC, as well as the production of auxin as it contributes to the reverse fountain flow. In the QC, SCR negatively regulates genes associated with auxin biosynthesis and mediates phytohormone cross-talk among the actively growing root zones. There was no discernable difference in the nuclear localization pattern of SCR::SCR–GFP between the root endodermis and QC of the plants grown on the ISS and the comparable ground controls (Figure 5c,d,g,h). This suggests that the upstream regulatory circuits for critical auxin synthesis steps are intact in spaceflight. The spaceflight distribution of SCR::SCR–GFP, together with the expression of TAA1::TAA1–GFP and DR5::GFP, strongly suggests that the entire auxin signaling pathway is fully developed in the absence of gravity.",

Cytokinins are counterpoints to auxin, including in the cross-talk among the root zones that plays a role in gravity responses. We examined the distribution cytokinin using ARR5::GFP, as the ARR5 gene is induced in the presence of free cytokinin. Plants on orbit showed a more restricted distribution of ARR5::GFP compared to ground controls (Figure 5i–l). In the flight plants, the expression of ARR5::GFP appeared limited to the columella and lateral root cap, whereas in the ground control plants ARR5::GFP expression extended shoot-ward from the root tip through the stele. The primary source for cytokinin production in the root tip is the columella cells. In a vertical orientation on the Earth, ARR5 expression is highest in the columella, but also extends shoot-ward through the stele, a pattern that can expand in response to gravistimulation. On the Earth, cytokinins also have roles in root curving, coiling and waving, and can influence features of the actin filament organization, which in turn affects root growth patterns. Plants grown on the ISS exhibit altered waving and skewing morphologies, as well as differences in the patterns of cell division and elongation. It is possible that cytokinin plays a larger role in these altered root growth strategies than does auxin, in the absence of gravity experienced during spaceflight. In addition, the repressed distribution of cytokinin as revealed by ARR expression in the spaceflight grown roots may also reflect a cytokinin influence in overall reduction in growth rate and development.",

In this particular case, our data show that auxin distributions of the primary root are not gravity dependent, even though these distributions are key to gravity responses. It is therefore likely that the role of gravity is minimal compared with the inherent developmental cues guided by auxin to define the architecture of the root tip. Indeed, these experiments that essentially remove the forces of gravity, join with previous studies that used genetics to uncouple gravitropism from auxin distribution (for example, refs.) to complete the notion that auxin gradients in the primary root are fundamentally developmental. Those developmental auxin gradients were coopted then to be sensitive to gravity responses and it seems logical then that the auxin signaling system in roots was present in plants as a developmental system before evolving additional roles in gravity responses. The role of auxin in structures other than the root tip bears investigation, as auxin-regulated genes are seen to change in expression during spaceflight, when examining the root as a whole, and root architecture is also influenced by spaceflight. The value of the present study is in having cell-specific reporters to begin the challenge of finding where in the root potential spaceflight auxin-regulated changes do occur. The data presented here suggest that those auxin-related changes do not occur in the major gravity-sensing cells of the primary root tip, as the distribution of DR5::GFP TAA::GFP and SCR::GFP are not affected by spaceflight at least to the level of sensitivity afforded by these reporters.",

The term “vertical” carries a direct association with the gravity vector. Without the ability to remove gravity from the plant environment, there was no reason to eliminate the term from the vernacular or the force from the concept. Our results show that the reverse fountain is neither reverse nor a fountain, as these terms imply that gravity is involved in the reversal of liquid flow. Rather, the auxin flow of the primary root tip is fundamentally no different from the auxin flow systems that guide other parts of plant primary development, except that it has been further engaged in the gravity response.",

In both the CASIS and APEX experiments, the astronaut on duty photographed the seedling-containing Petri plate before loading into the LMM; either by holding in front of the video feed camera (Figure 3b, red arrow), or with a standard SLR camera (Figure 2g–i). The plate was then loaded onto the LMM Petri support base and affixed to the microscope stage (Figure 3c, red arrow). Comparable operations were conducted with the ground control plates (Figure 2d–f). The SLR photographs were used to create root maps to guide the telemetric maneuvers to locate regions of interest on the Petri plates. The image in Figure 3d illustrates how the photograph of the seedlings on the plate was overlaid with the coordinate map for the LMM microscope stage. All operations of the stage in x, y and z were conducted telemetrically by maneuvering the motorized stage through upload of numerical coordinates. The numbers along the periphery of the field of view in Figure 3d define the x and y coordinates. The stage could also be moved in the z direction for focus, and also for the collection of different focal planes. LMM images are collected with a Q-Imaging Retiga 1300 CCD camera (Burnaby, BC, Canada) with a resolution of 1,280×1,024 and 2×2 binning. The white-light images from the LMM were captured using the beam splitter option on the LMM and LMM GIU. GFP fluorescence was visualized using the CHROMA FITC Filter Set: Exciter wavelength 480, Dichroic wavelength 505, and Emitter wavelength 535. The 10× objective (numerical aperture 0.3) was used in CARA, and the 20× objective (numerical aperture 0.4) was used in APEX03-2; these are both “dry” objectives; necessary as the plants were viewed through the lid of the Petri plate. The management and administration of the LMM operations was conducted by the personnel of GRC, particularly through the efforts of teams from ZIN Technologies. The authors oversaw the data collection and drove sample and region of interest selection in real time operations.",

            "text": "In the APEX03-2 experiment, a four-day-old imaging plate containing pDR5r::GFP, pTAA1::TAA1–GFP and pSCR::SCR–GFP was harvested to RNAlater (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA), into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs). KFTs are spaceflight hardware providing three levels of liquid containment for fixing biological samples in space. After collection, the loaded KFTs were stowed at −80° C in the MELFI freezer on the ISS; ground controls were also collected to KFTs, but were stowed in a standard −80 °C freezer. The samples were kept frozen until the samples were returned to the authors’ laboratory. The preserved plants were then imaged on the ground with a Leica TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Mannheim, Germany) in the Cytometry Core at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. The roots were prepared by rinsing in distilled water for 2 min, and then either mounted directly in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) or counterstained with a 0.1% solution of Calcofluor White for 5 min. Calcofluor White staining was followed by a 5 min wash in distilled water and then mounting in Vectashield for imaging. The imaging parameters for confocal microcopy were kept identical between spaceflight and ground control samples within each genotype, although these parameters could vary among genotypes. For instance: pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, spaceflight and ground, was imaged with the following parameters: exposure 62, pinhole 69, zoom of 1, step size 2.98, line average 2, FC gain of 700 and offset at −3.0. pDR5r::GFP imaging parameters were identical to those used for pTAA1::TAA1–GFP, although the gain was increased for all pDR5r::GFP roots (for both spaceflight and ground) to 760. The 40× oil objective was used throughout, and the 488 laser was kept at 38%. Keeping the imaging parameters constant between spaceflight and ground control samples enabled clear comparisons of the same relative location within the spaceflight and ground roots.",
