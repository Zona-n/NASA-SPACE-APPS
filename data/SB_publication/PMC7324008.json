Here we sought to determine how simulated microgravity (sim-μG) impacts both energy and lipid metabolism in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells in the central nervous system. We report increased mitochondrial respiration and increased glycolysis 24 hours after exposure to sim-μG. Moreover, examination of the secretome after three days exposure of OLs to sim-μG confirmed increased the Krebs cycle, flux in sim-μG. The secretome study also revealed a significant increase in the synthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids such as, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-GPC (5.67), lysolipids like 1-oleoyl-GPE (4.48) were also increased by microgravity. Although longer chain lipids were not observed in this study, it is possible that at longer time points OLs would have continued moving forward toward the synthesis of lipids that constitute myelin. For centuries, basic developmental biology research has been the pillar to an array of discoveries that have led to clinical applications; we believe that studies using microgravity will open new avenues to our understanding of the brain in health and disease, in particular, to the discovery of new molecules and mechanisms impossible to unveil while in 1G.",

The absence of gravity presents a unique opportunity to gain new insights into basic neural development and function. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) that synthesize and maintain myelin (rev. Baumann and Pham Ding 2000). OLs form compact segments of myelin membrane that coils around the axon and allows for the saltatory conduction of electric impulses, also known as a “neural transmission”.",

OL can myelinate up to 50 different axons at a time and thus, the lack of mature OLs or myelin can lead to severe life-long disabilities like cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis (MS) and other conditions. Once myelination is completed, OLs have synthesized ~40% of the total lipids in the human brain. The abundance of myelin; accounts for ~30% of the dry weight of the human brain. Studies have shown that the overall ratio of proteins to lipids is approximately, 1 to 186 in myelin. The enrichment of lipids in myelin is basically due to myelin basic protein (MBP) which extrudes most proteins from the compacted myelin sheath. Cholesterol, galactosylceramide and ethanolamine plasmalogen are the most significant lipids in myelin accounting for 65% of the total lipid dry weight.",

Studer et al., 2011). We have pioneered the study of simulated microgravity on neural cells, in particular OLs. The first steps included adapting common cell culture hardware in order to be used in conjunction with the simulated microgravity (sim-μG) producing robot, “the 3D-clinostat” (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries). Once suitable conditions were established, we used this innovative culture system to study the impact of sim-μG on OLs. We first examined the impact of sim-μG on oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) development. We subjected rodent and human OLPs to short exposures (24 – 72 hours) to sim-μG and revealed that OLPs displayed an enhanced and sustained proliferation with a concomitant shortening of the cell cycle in sim-μG by utilizing BrdU and time-lapse microscopy. Exposure to sim-μG also increased the migratory properties of the OLPs.",

Normal cells use oxidative phosphorylation in the presence of oxygen to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a cellular fuel. Fatty acids (FAs) are a critical source of energy for mitochondrial oxidation and cellular ATP generation. OLs possess a broad plasticity that can be extensively modulated by external stimuli. Here we sought to determine the impact of sim-μG on A) energy metabolism of post-mitotic human (Hu) HuOLs after exposure to weightlessness; B) to assess lipidomic changes in the secretome of OLs produced while exposed to weightlessness. Our results indicate that mitochondrial function is enhanced in OLs by sim-μG vs. OLs maintained in 1G. Moreover, elevated energy demand in OLs while in sim-μG led to an increased use of glycolysis to support energetics.",

Cells were kept 24h in standard culture conditions (37°C, 4.5% CO2). The following day, wells were filled with fresh OSM at 30°C. The plates to be kept in 1G were covered and placed in the incubator. The plates to be placed in sim-μG in the 3D-clinostat were covered with Milli-wrap (Millipore Corp. Bradford, MA. USA) and incubated 24h in the clinostat at 37°C, 4.5% CO2 overnight. The following day, some of the supernatant was removed from the well plates. We used an XF24 Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) to measure oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) (Seahorse Wave, RRID:SCR_014526). OCR and ECAR reflect rates of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, respectively. Measurements were performed with the cells in unbuffered DMEM assay medium supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine and 25 mM glucose. Measures were recorded before (basal reading) and after the sequential injections of oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone/myxothiazol. Maximal OCR was the response to FCCP, whereas maximal ECAR was the response to oligomycin. OCR was normalized to cellular protein concentration determined with the Protein Assay reagent (Bio-Rad) in all experiments.",

Then OLPs were harvested and processed to ascertain the expression of molecular biomarkers for genes proper to the OL lineage and some for NSCs. The main goal was to characterize how the markers would be expressed in terms of lineage specificity relevant to the difference in gravity. The biomarkers of interest included those belonging from early to mid-stage undifferentiated neuronal-glial cells that are known to localize within cortical-striatal regions such as nestin and Pax-6. The expression of markers for early OLPs that would indicate commitment such as Sox2, Olig2, PDGFRa and transferrin (Tf) were also examined. The primers used are shown in table 1. We found the presence of all the markers examined in all cultures at day 1 or day 5 suggesting that some cells remain uncommitted still 5 days after being in OSM. Nonetheless, there are numerous early OL markers also present. We found that absolutely all progenitor markers have a higher level of expression when cells have been in 0G and this increase is time dependent. In contrast, in cells maintained in 1G full time most of these markers tended to decrease (Fig. 4). Simulated microgravity did not alter the expression of the markers studied. Nonetheless, human OLP specification is a long process when compared to rodent OLP. Thus, some progenitors still expressed Pax-6, Sox-2 and nestin (stem cell markers) while co-expressing OLP specific markers Olig2, PDGFRα and transferrin (TF) regardless of whether they were in 1G or 0G (Fig. 4).",

Lipids can also be synthesized from citrate, so, some of the glucose input into the TCA cycle could be drawn into fatty acid production.

In contrast in OLs exposed to 0G it was detected in 100%, which could suggest biosynthetic shifts toward increased sphingolipid production.

We revealed the enhancement of two metabolic patterns, energetics and lipid metabolism. After 24h sim-μG, OLs exhibited higher respiratory activity as well as greater respiratory and glycolytic reserve capacity compared with OLs maintained in 1G, suggesting a high energy demand by these cells. From the study of secreted metabolites study (72h in sim-μG), the high levels of glucose and pyruvate utilization, as they entered the Krebs cycle, corroborated the high energy demand elicited by sim-μG in these cells. Altogether, these results indicate that cells maintained in microgravity exhibit enhanced energy production. Lipids can also be synthesized from citrate; so, some of the glucose input into the TCA could be drawn into fatty acid production. In addition, malonate which is produced from hydrolysis of malonyl-CoA was also elevated in 0G vs. 1G OLs. Alpha-ketoglutarate increases could reflect increased glutamine use to support energetics, which could be needed if some citrate was being siphoned into fatty acid biosynthesis.",

Most cell types use glucose, but OLs use ketone bodies as precursors for cholesterol synthesis. Moreover, enzymes that convert acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate into acetoacetyl-CoA are highly enriched in OLs. Because an enormous amount of lipids needs to be synthesized and transferred to the myelin membrane, cholesterol may use more than one route of delivery. A direct transfer of cholesterol from the ER to the plasma membrane exists and may serve as a short cut for the transfer of lipids from their site of synthesis to the cell surface of OLs. Once cholesterol is in the myelin sheath, its turnover slows down resulting in a half-live of months. Cholesterol provides stability to myelin by regulating its fluidity and permeability (rev.). The increase in cholesterol found in the secretome of OLs after 3 days in sim-0G indicates that they were producing the lipids necessary for membranes and perhaps some in preparation for the myelinogenic process, just like they do in vivo.",

The increased ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) and carnitine in the secretome could be due to changes in fatty acid oxidation, to support increased energetics. The main question is: why is there a huge energy demand in respect to cells maintained in 1G? “Would the reason be that OLs are progressing on preparation for the establishment of the premyelinating stage?

            "text": "Besides its role in general synthesis of cell and organelle membranes, cholesterol plays several key roles during myelinogenesis, it is a structural lipid but it is not inert. It has dynamic functions such as modulation of translation. It has been shown that during myelinogenesis, the rate of cholesterol synthesis depends on the speed of myelin synthesis. Knock out mouse models, such as Niemann–Pick disease type C protein (NPC1), have shown that cholesterol levels in OLs and neurons are important for proper myelination. Oligodendrocyte-specific squalene synthase mutant mice resulted in the absence of cholesterol, leading to a downregulation of mRNAs for major myelin proteins (Saher et al., 2005). Thus, cholesterol synthesis and presence appears to be coupled to the metabolism of other myelin components, perhaps determining the maturity of the cell. In addition, it is believed that cholesterol levels determine myelin assembly by regulating energy production and supporting protein translation via mTOR signaling. Recent experiments performed in Zebrafish have shown that high cholesterol levels are required for myelin growth and compaction. Some direct interactions between certain myelin proteins containing cholesterol recognition amino-acid consensus (CRAC) motifs and cholesterol have been documented.",

            "text": "It has been reported that as myelin is being formed from 20 to 40 days in the rat brain, FAs and aldehyde patterns change. In a function of time palmitoleic acid, unsaturated C18 aldehydes, oleic acid and monosaturated FAs (C20) display higher values relative to such saturated moieties as palmitic acid, saturated C18 aldehyde, stearic acid and C22 saturated FAs. With age the percentage of long-chain FAs longer than C18 saturated or unsaturated increases in the normal rat brain. The present study for purpose of the secretome analysis was performed after three days in microgravity. A future time course study would allow us to respond if microgravity would elicit the same pattern observed during normal in vivo myelin formation as previously reported. Nonetheless, it is clear that microgravity positively impacted lipid synthesis by OLs by triggering their production faster than in 1G OLs as shown in 1G cultures. This phenomenon although in an indirect manner attests for the presence of the lipid-related enzymes that should have been present in OLs in order to form these lipids. Recently, live-imaging analysis of myelination in zebrafish has shown that OLs (at least in the zebrafish), make new myelin within a period of just five hours. We do not know how long a human OL would take to make myelin in sim-0G but, what is clear is that the early abundant production of lipids including some myelin lipids, appears to be more efficient in simulated microgravity than in 1G.",

            "text": "We have previously reported that during and after exposure to sim-μG, OLPs proliferated more than control cells kept in 1G. We also showed that these cells expressed early markers, while a decreased number of cells expressed mature OL markers, such as MBP or CC1. Thus, maturation of these cells appeared to be delayed in a transient manner but, not impaired by exposure to 0G. Our current data shows that these apparently immature OLs kept busy producing an enormous amount of lipids in a more efficient manner. Taken together our previous report on a delayed expression of mature myelin markers and the current data, it is clear that OLs addressed the synthesis of enzymes timely and efficiently to be able to produce certain lipidic components of myelin. This phenomenon might consequently delay the expression of mature protein markers such as MBP which is needed later, when the myelin sheath would be formed. It is conceivable that Human OLs secreted newly formed lipids into the culture medium as a survival mechanism and perhaps due to their smaller cell body size and, because of the absence of axons to progress towards a myelinating stage. Moreover, it is also possible that OLs in sim-μG require of more time to produce longer chain myelin-related lipids, after all, 1G OLs did not produce any of the sphingo-lipids in the same period of time. Additionally, in our hands for an optimal OL development, OLs in culture when in 1G, require of GDM (glial chemically defined medium; and) to support the optimal development of immature OL and to reach the mature myelinating stage they require OLDEM (OL defined medium) the OL medium formulation designed to support the production of myelin enzymes and myelin membrane by cultured OLs. We have previously shown that rat OLs maintained in sim-μG re-capitulate the developmental stages for OL. More experiments are needed to elucidate this and many other questions that come to mind. Finally, the Seahorse experiments and metabolomics revealed significantly higher mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in immature OLs indicating a switch of source of energy.",

The present is the first study totally innovative to address the effects of microgravity on OL metabolomics. This is a nascent field of research.

Following dissection and using STM the cell suspension was mechanically dissociated and pelleted. Cells were suspended in STMc medium. The cell suspension was sieved through a 70μm mesh and plated on anti-PSA-NCAM antibody–coated dishes. Cells were allowed to adhere for 5 min prior to removing them from the safety cabinet. NSCs were propagated directly on this matrix of PSA-NCAM antibody. To preserve self-renewal and stemness 50% of the medium was removed and replenished with the same volume of STMc every other day until confluent. When confluent, NSCs were harvested by shaking the flask, pelleted and seeded on PdL coated flasks with OSM. This medium instructs them towards the OL fate choice, while allowing them to proliferate. For both 1G and 0G cultures the incubator was set at 36.8°C and 4.5% CO2 as usual. For 1G and 0G cultures the full volume of culture medium was pre-equilibrated overnight in the CO2 incubator. To use the 3D-clinostat, the flasks or cell containers need to be full and without even a small bubble, in order to prevent demise of the cells. While this study was performed using 2D culture oligo spheres (3D cultures) would also work. After OSM has been equilibrated flasks were filled, the bubble removed and the cultures placed in the 3D-clinostat. The cells that would remain in 1G were placed in the bottom of the same incubator and using the same flasks, coating and containing the same volume of medium. Cultures were recovered after 72h for analysis.",

N-acetylaspartate (and aspartate) is a precursor to the neuropeptide NAAG, as well as being important for transfer of 2-carbon units for myelin biosynthesis. It may be of interest to assess myelination in co-culture (or in animals exposed to 0G). Random Forest classification using named metabolites in media of Blank compared to 1G and 0G OLPs gave a predictive accuracy of 100%. Random chance would be expected to yield a predictive accuracy of 33% n = 5. RFA was performed as previously described (Mitchell MW, Open Journal of Statistics, 2011).",

            "text": "Myelin is essential for our daily activities. Abnormality in oligodendrocytes (OLs), the myelin forming cells, produces severe central nervous system pathologies during development and in neurodegenerative disorders. In most myelin disorders OL progenitors (OLPs) are present but fail to mature. OLPs exposure to simulated microgravity (0G) results in a large need for energy which appears to be required for extensive lipid secretion. While further studies are needed, enhanced production of membrane lipids suggests that OLPs may progress towards next developmental stages where more extensive cell processes are formed. Moreover, OLPs in 1G did not secrete most of these lipids. Could priming OLPs in 0G enhance membrane formation after grafting?",
