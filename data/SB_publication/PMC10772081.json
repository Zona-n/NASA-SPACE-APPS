The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 significantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal, ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health.",

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in a helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike (S) proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through the S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to allow for viral membrane fusion. Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts.

These include major shifts in metabolic and biochemical pathways, including the oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The immune system is also involved in these adaptations, with a study showing upregulation of Type I interferon (IFN) gene signaling pathways leading to changes with cellular responses to IFN and triggering changes with associated cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. These stimuli lead to cellular adaptations including endoplasmic reticulum stress, upregulated unfolded protein response and downregulation of pathways including spliceosome-mediated RNA processing, mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition, and impairment in the biogenesis and assembly of the electron transport chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to decreased mitochondrial function, increased glycolysis, and shunting towards the pentose 5 phosphate pathway, resulting in changes in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics that lead to pathophysiological outcomes.",

For example, the TCA cycle is the main cellular source of energy and critical for aerobic respiration; serum levels of the TCA metabolites (citrate, fumarate, malate, and aconitate) were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients as compared with controls, with choline specifically observed to be decreased in patients with severe COVID-19. Serum metabolites that were increased in these patients included deoxy-thymidine, deoxyuridine, adenine, cystine, and homocysteine. These data provide context as to how specific biochemical and physiological pathways, e.g., the TCA cycle, shift as a result of COVID-19 infection and lead to pathogenesis. For example, elevated homocysteine is associated with endothelial damage. These shifts in metabolites reflect a systemic shift during acute COVID-19 infection, and warrant study of subsequent specific organ adaptations (e.g., bone as a major source of citrate, which is released into the plasma during bone resorption, with soft tissues not generally providing a significant source of citrate into blood plasma).",

Excess energy is stored in the form of lipids, with lipids also used as an immediate energy source or for later use. Lipids also serve as second messengers, activating protein and immune pathways. Indeed, it has been reported SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lipids levels to change and lipid metabolism to alter, with one study using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches observing specific circulating lipids associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including increases in triglycerides and free fatty acids (e.g., arachidonic acid and oleic acid). These lipids also correlated with disease severity. A specific class of lipids are lipid mediators (LMs), which are bioactive lipids produced locally in response to extracellular stimuli and are involved in immune regulation. Studies have investigated their role in relation to COVID-19 severity as well. One report involving 19 healthy patients, 18 COVID-19 patients who did not need ICU admission (mild), and 20 patients that needed ICU admission (severe) showed an increase of free poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and diminished amounts of PUFA-containing plasmalogens in patients with COVID-19 that also correlated with disease severity. Another study performing metabolomics and lipidomics measurements on patients (49 subjects, 33 were COVID-19–positive subjects and 16 COVID-19–negative subjects) showed alterations in fatty acid metabolism that were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. More specifically, short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines were significantly diminished in all patients with COVID-19, while all Non-Esterified Fatty Acids (except nonanoic acid) were increased in all COVID-19 patients.",

Moreover, the balance of biochemical components, whether the machinery (e.g., TCA proteins), fuel sources (e.g., lipids), or messenger molecules (e.g., metabolites) appear to shift towards a physiological catabolic state that may be further exacerbated by a patient’s underlying conditions and demographics. Metabolic biofactors are also intrinsically tied with the recovery and response to viral infection, with immune-regulating lipids, pro-inflammatory lipids, and lipid mediators plausibly modulating the immune response during COVID-19, as one example. The immune system’s physiology is also reliant on its metabolic function, whether from a development, proliferation, activation, or memory perspective. Immunity is shaped and guided by humoral factors, which we address in the next section, as to the SARS-CoV-2 viral influence on these factors and the effects on the body.",

One example is bradykinin, a peptide that is involved with physiological effects, including dilation of arterioles through release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and EDHF, constriction of veins by prostaglandin F2, as well as various biochemical effects including upregulation of intracellular Ca2+, regulation of cAMP/cGMP, arachidonic acid release, promotion of VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and activation of TGF-B, JAK/STAT pathways. Additionally, bradykinin is degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enhanced by angiotensin produced by ACE2. Bradykinin, angiotensin, ACE, and ACE2, are all part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which serves a role within the endocrine system in regulation of renal, cardiac, and vascular physiology, and in turn, systemic physiology. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell through receptors such as ACE2 and NRP-1, in a process requiring the transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) protein; thus, SARS-CoV-2 directly interacts with the RAS system and influences its activity. Indeed, gene analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from COVID-19 patients showed a critical imbalance of RAS-related factors, including decreased expression of ACE, while increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, and bradykinin, which were suggestive of elevated bradykinin levels systemically that lead to the cardiovascular symptoms seen with patients. Another study of the bradykinin cascade of COVID-19 patients correlated changes in this pathway with disease severity, showing accumulated bradykinin levels were related with patient disease severity, as well as with levels of inflammation, coagulation, and lymphopenia.",

For example, the ACE2 receptor is expressed in endocrine glands, including the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenals, pancreas, thyroid glands, ovaries, and testes. Studies have shown reduced thyroid (e.g., subacute thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis), adrenal (e.g., hypocortisolism, hyponatremia), hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (e.g., HPA dysfunction, hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism), and pancreatic islet function (e.g., hyperglycemia, pancreatic injury based from elevated amylase and lipase), as well as damage to the testes and changes with menstrual cycle being described in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection has also been suggested to affect glycemic control, with an international registry having been organized to investigate the interaction between diabetes and COVID-19. Moreover, clinical studies show more severe outcomes in patients with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension; however, there is a lack of data in humans on ACE2 expression in pathological conditions with endocrine tissues, an area which needs future investigation. Various mouse studies have enabled us to investigate organ-specific adaptations, including examining the effects of ACE2 deletion in endocrine organs and observing the beneficial effects of ACE2 gene therapy. The details of these studies are outside the scope of this review, but are elaborated in ref.. As with bradykinin, the remodeling of endocrine factors results in changes with the factors that endocrine organs produce and secrete, though this is an area warrants more investigation. Indeed, these include the non-coding transcriptome, genes which are not involved with protein synthesis, but are transcribed and often secreted into the circulation, in turn providing information on the genetic state of their originating cells, but also controlling and regulating biological adaptations due to the ability of the non-coding RNAs to interact with other macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. We elaborate on the changes with the non-coding RNA transcriptome seen in COVID-19 patients in the next section.",

The exosomes produced from specific cells will communicate their cellular phenotypic state, with each exosome sharing the identity of its source cell. In turn, organ-specific adaptations from SARS-CoV-2 infection may be able to be delineated through measurement of exosomes. One study explored this by investigating how SARS-CoV-2 is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, with SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins contained within neuron- and astrocyte-derived exosomes quantified in post COVID-19 infection. Indeed, these exosomes contained SARS-CoV-2 N and S1 proteins and varied depending on the context of the disease severity and timeline of COVID-19. This study is one example of the utility exosomes may provide for complex, multi-organ conditions like COVID-19, in studying and determining physiological alterations resulting from the disease condition.",

Considering the possible involvement of dysregulated miRNAs upon infection on the systemic manifestations of COVID-19, multiple research groups profiled circulating miRNA levels in SARS-CoV-2 patients. One study of a stratified cohort of COVID-19 patients showed a molecular signature composed of three blood-circulating miRNAs (hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p and hsa-miR-195-5p), independently classified COVID-19 cases, distinguishing them from other viral infections such as H1N1 influenza and healthy controls.",

Mitochondrial analysis showed miR-2392 targets were OXPHOS, mitochondrial translation, and mitochondrial metabolism related transcripts. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 elevates miRNAs, such as miR-2392, which can result in affecting biochemical pathways (e.g., downregulation of OXPHOS), and treatment with anti-miR-2393 therapeutics potentially blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters and hACE2-A549 cells.",

Functionally, lncRNAs can regulate the dynamics of the genomic output from chromatin to the cytoplasm, mainly by acting as molecular scaffolds of biological complexes that establish interactions with proteins, DNA, and other RNA molecules. Early transcriptomic studies using cell models show SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a transcriptional pattern that produces several differentially expressed lncRNAs. Through co-expression network analysis, another study identified four differentially expressed lncRNAs correlating with genes involved in various immune-related pathways, suggesting that the aberrant expression of these four lncRNAs can be associated with SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storms and antiviral responses. A different study using nasopharyngeal swabs from infected patients characterized an lncRNA, LASI, that is antisense to the ICAM-1 gene and had an expression profile strongly correlating with SARS-CoV-2 viral loads. LASI’s mechanism of action was shown to be through its interaction with the viral genome and subsequent knock-down of viral replication processes, which also resulted in the presence of inflammation markers. In another study, a pattern of lncRNAs (NRIR, BISPR, and MIR155HG) was observed from nasopharyngeal COVID-19 patient samples that correlated with viral loads. Interestingly, NRIR and BISPR lncRNAs were also upregulated in the blood of COVID-19 patients as reported in the COVIDOME project, suggesting possible involvement in the systemic manifestations of the viral infection.",

A large autopsy study investigating multiple organs (heart, lung, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes) showed that the cellular and functional gene signatures from each organ’s major cell types (e.g., cardiomyocytes in the heart) decrease as a function of the viral load. More specifically in the heart (n = 41 from patient autopsy samples), despite no histological change, many heart functional markers (e.g., TNNI3, TNNT2, MYBPC3, PLN, and HAND1) showed decreased levels resulting from COVID-19 infection. Another study showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the myocardial heart tissue from autopsy cases, suggested to be tied to myocardial injury. Indeed, these cellular adaptations extend into the vascular system (e.g., arteries, veins, etc.), with histopathological evidence from autopsy studies showing direct viral infection of endothelial cells and micro- and macrovascular thrombosis occurring in both the arterial and venous circulations. An autopsy study investigating COVID-19 in three patients showed SARS-CoV-2 viral components present in the endothelial cells from different autopsied organs, including the kidney, lung, heart, and liver were each infected with SARS-CoV-2. Inflammation of the endothelium was also observed, along with recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the site of damage. In vitro studies also support SARS-CoV-2 being able to directly infect cardiovascular cells as seen from experiments showing viral infection of engineered human blood vessel organoids. Severe COVID-19 has also been associated with endothelial specific changes and effects such as elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and increased presence of von Willebrand Factor. Endotheliitis from COVID-19 can occur, leading to a loss of cell–cell junctions, loss of endothelial cells, exposure of the basement membrane, abnormal cytokine release, abnormal reactive oxygen species release, and intussusceptive angiogenesis.

The two arms of the immune system communicate, interact, and support each other in responding to injury, aided by humoral, circulating factors such as cytokines and chemokines, that provide information and context to immune cells as to how, where, and what to respond to, as well as the magnitude of the response. In turn, there are various feedback loops that provide guidance and direction to the immune system, both innate and adaptive, with SARS-CoV-2 activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems.",

Additionally, the loss of ACE2 and DABK in the lungs of patients encourages neutrophil infiltration and inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 has also been suggested to dysregulate type 1 interferon signaling, which contributes to immune evasion early in infection. Consistent with this finding, bulk analysis of whole blood cell transcriptomes of severe COVID-19 patients compared with non-critically ill COVID-19 patients showed upregulation of Interferon alpha as the primary contributor to severe COVID-19. Activated monocytes and macrophages also migrate to the lungs (chemotaxis), further exacerbating lung inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis. Several studies have reported disordered structure of the infected lung, along with extensive immune infiltration. For example, the lung alveoli in COVID-19 patients develop additional hyaluronan, forming a coating that can reduce oxygen exchange, as well as leading to pulmonary edema. Another study of COVID-19 patients showed chronic lung impairment accompanied by persistent respiratory immune alterations, showing specific memory T and B cells enriched at the site of infection. With the significant neutrophil, macrophage, T and B cell infiltration and activation observed, and localized hyperinflammatory states of these immune cells around alveolar epithelial cells, this develops into more lung damage and loss of compartmental identity. When a timeline and pattern of the cytokine storm in tracheal aspirate samples was organized and reported, divergences in the systemic versus airway cytokine production during COVID-19 were observed. Indeed, a study assessing lung function of critical COVID-19 patients showed 55% of them experienced persistent impairment three months after ICU discharge, including declines in patient lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. This suggests respiratory failure is another significant factor involved with patient mortality with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an investigation of single-nuclei RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient lung samples identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, with the data showing COVID-19 patient lungs were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated macrophages, though with impaired T-cell responses and suggestions of impaired lung regeneration, based on alveolar type 1 cell phenotypes.",

There are case by case variations; for example, an influx of T cells and myeloid cells occurs into the myocardium. In response to this event, COVID-19’s pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) are activated, as well as cytokines released by alveolar macrophages. These pathways are thought to contribute to the dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 and the subsequent dysfunction of T cells. Changes also occur within the heart, as seen with gene expression analysis of cardiac tissue for TNF-ɑ, interferon-γ, chemokine ligand 5, interleukin-6, interleukin-8 (CXCL8), and interleukin-18. Severe COVID-19 is also associated with elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and the presence of von Willebrand Factor (vWF). Indeed, COVID-19 induces a complex pattern of cytokine release as part of an overall dysregulated immune response that, in severe cases, injures the parenchyma of vital organs and leads to viremia and sepsis.",

In one study of COVID-19 patients, a notable increase in multiple serum cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6 and IL-10) was seen, while another study showed high plasma levels of IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, bFGF, GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF, TNF-α, and VEGF. A different study showed increased levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin, IL-6 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients. These results suggest an overproduction of cytokines in response to lung damage, or as a compensatory response to attempt to re-direct, accelerate, or shutdown the immune response. These cytokine fluctuations also coincide with systemic inflammation and myocardial injury; in 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in Hubei province, heart palpitations were noted as one of the presenting symptoms in 7.3% of patients. Moreover, there have been reports of complete heart blockage and atrial fibrillation in patients with COVID-19 infection. In patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (e.g., soluble IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) have been observed, with these cytokines disrupting endothelial cells antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory functions, leading to coagulation dysregulation, complement and platelet activation, and leukocyte recruitment in the microvasculature. While increased levels of circulating chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, regulatory cytokines, and growth factors were observed in severe COVID patients who died as compared to surviving patients, a more restricted and selective increase of cytokines such as IL-10 was observed in the airway samples with actual decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-5, and IL-2 as compared to uninfected controls. These results demonstrate that inflammation is also highly modulated in the airways as an attempt to decrease exacerbated inflammation. Figure 1 illustrates a snapshot of extracellular factors involved with immune adaptations during COVID-19 and the uniqueness of systemic versus airway inflammatory milieu.",

COVID-19 is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction, though the burden of infection outside the respiratory tract and time to viral clearance is not well understood.

While psychological and environmental factors are likely to be involved, long-term biochemical adaptations, including increased oxidative stress and muscle mitochondrial failure, may contribute to the chronic fatigue syndrome found in PASC patients. In addition, due to the activation of the fibrosis pathway from persistent virus-induced inflammation, the heart may subsequently undergo structural remodeling that may also explain the PASC symptoms.
