Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of spaceflight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended spaceflight. Mice were exposed to spaceflight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~3 h post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after spaceflight. Spaceflight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting a persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Spaceflight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the inflammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. Spaceflight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, spaceflight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress.",

Both spaceflight and head-down-tilt bed rest, a ground-based model for human spaceflight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy. A reduction in myocardial interstitial fluid may contribute to lower myocardial mass following microgravity exposure. In rodents, 14 days of spaceflight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy. In contrast, spaceflight for one week did not affect cardiac mass, although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU), a ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies, but not in others, thus further work in this area is needed.",

Goldstein et al. report that spaceflight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration (6 days) spaceflight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays a pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle. More recently, long duration spaceflight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation-related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dysfunction, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, spaceflight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display a gene expression profile consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel findings on how the heart responds to spaceflight at the tissue level.",

NOX1 belongs to the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in a highly regulated fashion. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide radicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased expression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in the vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction. Several recent studies using ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading causes cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by fractional shortening. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin (a NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac responses to simulated weightlessness. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that increased expression of Nox1 during spaceflight contributes to oxidative stress and myocardial abnormalities.",

PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase 2 (COX2), is the key, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both a dioxygenase and as a peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression can lead to inefficient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output, decreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that Ptgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and inflammatory heart diseases. In addition to inflammation, the prostaglandin pathway plays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, spaceflight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation to replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to a biomechanical mechanism for microgravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway. Inhibition of PTGS2 also impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading. Thus, regulation of the prostaglandin pathway by spaceflight via changes in Ptgs2 expression may contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth.",

Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of specific cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive regulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, inflammation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53 Signaling PCR array.

Increases in p21 levels in bone from mice in this spaceflight experiment spaceflight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21 levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart, though it is unlikely that such a small sub-population (1.3% of total) can account for our findings. More likely, the elevation in p21 caused by spaceflight may contribute to cardiomyopathies via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy and senescence. Interestingly, Myc, a mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes cardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the spaceflight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21 re-expression in p21-null mice. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21 elevation might interfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during post-natal development.",

Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression findings from this experiment include the fixed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (3+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in flight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the flight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely reflect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may reflect re-entry and re-adaptation to 1-gravity on Earth, however briefly.",
