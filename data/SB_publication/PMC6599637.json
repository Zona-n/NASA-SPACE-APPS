            "text": "Reduced weight bearing, and to a lesser extent radiation, during spaceflight have been shown as potential hazards to astronaut joint health. These hazards combined effect to the knee and hip joints are not well defined, particularly with low-dose exposure to radiation. In this study, we examined the individual and combined effects of varying low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing on the cartilage of the knee and hip joints. C57BL/6J mice (n = 80) were either tail suspended via hindlimb unloading (HLU) or remained full-weight bearing (ground). On day 6, each group was divided and irradiated with 0 Gy (sham), 0.1 Gy, 0.5 Gy or 1.0 Gy (n = 10/group), yielding eight groups: ground-sham; ground-0.1 Gy; ground-0.5 Gy; ground-1.0 Gy; HLU-sham; HLU-0.1 Gy; HLU-0.5 Gy; and HLU-1.0 Gy. On day 30, the hindlimbs, hip cartilage and serum were collected from the mice. Significant differences were identified statistically between treatment groups and the ground-sham control group, but no significant differences were observed between HLU and/or radiation groups. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CECT) demonstrated decrease in volume and thickness at the weight-bearing femoral-tibial cartilage-cartilage contact point in all treatment groups compared to ground-sham. Lower collagen was observed in all groups compared to ground-sham. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a biomarker for ongoing cartilage degradation, was increased in all of the irradiated groups compared to ground-sham, regardless of unloading. Mass spectrometry of the cartilage lining the femoral head and subsequent Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. Our findings demonstrate that both individually and combined, HLU and exposure to spaceflight-relevant radiation doses lead to cartilage degradation of the knee and hip with expression of an arthritic phenotype. Moreover, early administration of low-dose irradiation (0.1, 0.5 or 1.0 Gy) causes an active catabolic response in cartilage 24 days postirradiation. Further research is warranted with a focus on the prevention of cartilage degradation from long-term periods of reduced weight bearing and spaceflight-relevant low doses and qualities of radiation.",

            "text": "Astronauts must maintain their musculoskeletal health during spaceflight to ensure mission success. Joint loading on Earth is necessary to maintain structural integrity, proper function and homeostasis of cartilage and other tissues constituting load-bearing synovial joints. Thus, the reduced weight bearing experienced with spaceflight represents a substantial challenge to maintaining the health of synovial joints. Clinically relevant structural degradation of cartilage has been documented after periods of prescribed partial- or nonweight-bearing. Radiation, a frequently undetermined threat present during spaceflight, also affects joint health and induces an arthritic phenotype, observed at higher doses in clinical applications, and at lower doses in preclinical studies. Chronic knee damage has been observed in rats after acute exposure to 1 Gy X rays, which is relevant to spaceflight scenarios (e.g., solar flare). To our knowledge, the combined effects of low-dose exposure (< 1 Gy) and reduced weight bearing have not been studied together.",

Of particular interest were the effects of low-dose radiation on cartilage as a single and combined challenge with reduced weight bearing (hindlimb unloading; HLU) via tail suspension, as we hypothesized a priori that HLU would result in cartilage degradation. It has been unclear if low-dose radiation (0.1 and 0.5 Gy) is damaging, as a single challenge or part of a combined challenge.",

Animals were irradiated with two parallel, opposed beams for each irradiation, each providing one half the dose (0.05, 0.25 or 0.5 Gy, respectively). Uniform water-equivalent material (5 cm, Solid-Water®; Gammex RMI/Sun Nuclear Corp., Middleton, WI) was placed on each side of the box perpendicular to the photon beam paths to establish electronic equilibrium and obtain dose homogeneity. All necessary dosimetry was validated throughout the irradiation box with a Farmer ionization chamber as well as optically stimulated luminescent dosimeters (OSLDs).

The cartilage degradation observed in mice in this study is consistent with previously published studies, thus further validating our model. Moreover, our results demonstrate that low-dose radiation (<1 Gy) presents an additional challenge in combination with HLU to musculoskeletal tissues.

The catabolic effects of radiation exposure on the skeleton appear to be a primary cause of this arthritis with several reported studies demonstrating changes in cartilage with single fractions of ~ 1–2 Gy, both in vivo and in vitro.

            "text": "Surprisingly, the extent of cartilage degradation observed 24 days postirradiation at low doses of <1 Gy, e.g., 0.1 Gy, was evident across all ground and HLU groups. In these mice, a catabolic response was most clearly characterized by thinning of cartilage, loss of volume, and decreased collagen and generally increased levels of the collagen type II-degrading enzyme MMP-13 content measured histologically. Pathway analysis was consistent with an arthritic phenotype, characterized by reduced normal matrix protein constituents (e.g., ColXα1, aggrecan core, chondroadherin; Figs. 5 and 6) and increased S100A9 at radiation doses of 0.1 and 1.0 Gy, with high variance in the 0.5 Gy irradiated group, perhaps due to limited samples and pooling. Interestingly, these responses manifest to the greatest degree within the joint at the anatomic location of greatest weight bearing, the tibial-femoral cartilage-cartilage contact point (Figs. 1 and 2). While reduced volume, increased MMP-13 presence and less collagen are disadvantageous to articular cartilage, OARSI scoring did not yet indicate erosion of the surface, although this response could manifest later due to the indolent nature of arthritis progression. In agreement with previously published studies, radiation induced a catabolic response in both HLU and ground animals, as indicated by elevated circulating sCOMP in radiation groups (regardless of HLU) at the 30-day end point (Fig. 4). This was not observed in the HLU-sham group despite these animals exhibiting thinned, degraded cartilage; thus damage from the HLU challenge may have occurred earlier than the 30-day post-HLU end-point. Additionally, at day 30 the following osteoarthritic responses were noted: 1. Increased S100A6 concentration with combined HLU and radiation, suggestive of elevated oxidative stress within cartilage; and 2. Decreased CPNY2 concentration with all treatments, suggestive of increased apoptosis of chondrocytes vs. necrotic death. Increased oxidative stress has been previously shown to promote apoptosis of chondrocytes and an osteoarthritic phenotype. Thus, we have demonstrated that cartilage is sensitive to radiation injury at low doses. While this study utilized acute exposure to low-linear energy transfer (LET) X rays versus the primarily charged particle, high-energy and charge (HZE) radiation characteristic of the spaceflight environment, this preliminary evidence suggests that radiation present in the spaceflight environment may negatively affect the joint health of astronauts during periods of reduced weight bearing.",

A similar lack of complete recovery occurs in rodents exposed to radiation during HLU. Thus, reduced weight bearing and low-dose radiation simulating a spaceflight environment, both individually and combined, elevates the risk of joint damage in mice, and should be further studied.",

As samples were pooled across individuals and then statistics were performed on n = 3 pooled samples per group, we refrained from interpreting the radiation dose effects in terms of altered osteoarthritic pathways; however, it should be noted that these observations exist. Also, our brief follow-up period of 30 days (time to euthanasia) may not allow for evaluation of late-appearing degenerative changes. Future studies will be performed to determine if long-term follow-up is required. Moreover, the radiation applied here was low-LET X rays, rather than HZE or proton exposures characteristic of spaceflight scenarios, and administered by acute versus protracted exposure. Since our analysis detected that low dose, low- LET X-ray irradiation induces cartilage damage, future investigations should apply mixed beam charged particle radiation (or protons) that more accurately represent the spaceflight environment.",
