            "text": "Ionizing radiation present in extraterrestrial environment is an important factor that affects plants grown in spaceflight. Pearson correlation-based gene regulatory network inferencing from transcriptional responses of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana L. grown in real and simulated spaceflight conditions acquired by GeneLab, followed by topological and spectral analysis of the networks is performed. Gene regulatory subnetworks are extracted for DNA damage response processes. Analysis of radiation-induced ATR/ATM protein–protein interactions in Arabidopsis reveals interaction profile similarities under low radiation doses suggesting novel mechanisms of DNA damage response involving non-radiation-induced genes regulating other stress responses in spaceflight. The Jaccard similarity index shows that the genes AT2G31320, AT4G21070, AT2G46610, and AT3G27060 perform similar functions under low doses of radiation. The incremental association Markov blanket method reveals non-radiation-induced genes linking DNA damage response to root growth and plant development. Eighteen radiation-induced genes and sixteen non-radiation-induced gene players have been identified from the ATR/ATM protein interaction complexes involved in heat, salt, water, osmotic stress responses, and plant organogenesis. Network analysis and logistic regression ranking detected AT3G27060, AT1G07500, AT5G66140, and AT3G21280 as key gene players involved in DNA repair processes. High atomic weight, high energy, and gamma photon radiation result in higher intensity of DNA damage response in the plant resulting in elevated values for several network measures such as spectral gap and girth. Nineteen flavonoid and carotenoid pigment activations involved in pigment biosynthesis processes are identified in low radiation dose total light spaceflight environment but are not found to have significant regulations under very high radiation dose environment.

            "text": "Space is an environment that may have harmful effects on living organisms due to its hostile characteristics such as low oxygen, microgravity, lower pressure, and radiation. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles. Radiation is of two types: non-ionizing and Ionizing Radiation (IR). The radiation experienced in low Earth orbit is primarily low Linear Energy Transfer (LET) present in the International Space Station (ISS). Organisms in space are exposed to radiation, which affects the health of humans and the anatomy and growth of plants and animals. Space missions have to deal with IR in current spacecraft and future long-term deep-space missions. Plants are affected by radiation resulting in damage to cellular components and damage to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). Exposure to radiation causes DNA lesions in plant cells such as single-stranded breaks, Double Strand Breaks (DSB), mismatches, and modified bases. This leads to DNA Damage Response (DDR) that includes signal transduction, triggering either DNA repair, cell survival, or cell death. ",

It has a rapid life cycle of about six weeks from germination to mature plants. It can be easily cultivated in restricted space, has a small genome, a large number of mutant lines, extensive genetic maps, and genomic resources. Hence, it has been chosen as a model organism for spaceflight studies by research communities. Similar to observations made on terrestrial plant stressors, spaceflight missions have made extensive observations and collected transcriptional gene regulatory datasets of Arabidopsis. Plants have evolved genes that participate in DNA repair pathways that help the plant to survive the effects of radiation. Exposure to IR in Arabidopsis has shown a decrease in DNA methylation with no effect on morphology or root growth or seed germination. Ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutate (ATM) are Arabidopsis homologs of the human ATR and ATM genes, which are activated by DNA single and double-stranded breaks in eukaryotes. ATM-dependent transcriptional changes in Arabidopsis due to IR and its influence on root growth are discussed in. Two mutants of Arabidopsis defective in the ATR and ATM protein kinases have shown hypersensitivity to radiation resulting in the upregulation of hundreds of genes, while both ATR and ATM mutants responded with transcriptional changes to DNA damage due to radiation. The effect of acute radiation on Arabidopsis growth and its impact on protein-coding genes is presented in. ",

In this paper, we are analyzing the effects of low LET radiation on Arabidopsis found in low Earth orbit experienced by current spaceflight missions STS-129 and SpaceX. As long term spaceflight missions beyond the shielding effects of Earth’s atmosphere and magnetic field are contemplated, we also analyze the effects of two different types of IR on Arabidopsis: gamma photons, which have low rates of linear energy transfer (LET), and relativistic Fe nuclei (here termed HZE), a high LET form of IR. The regulation of the Carotenoid Biosynthesis Process (CBP) at the transcriptional level is important for the production of plant hormones, photosynthesis, and dispensing of seeds.

The hypothesis of this research is: if subnetworks of radiation-induced biological processes are extracted, then hub genes and target (authority) genes including non-radiation induced genes can be identified, because network analysis detects and ranks hub genes and authority genes. Furthermore, topological and algebraic spectral network analysis enables the comparison of the subnetworks for different doses of radiation, revealing similarities and differences in the regulation of these processes.

We have applied Pearson correlation network analysis to identify key gene players for cell wall biosynthesis, and root growth in Arabidopsis in spaceflight using the gene expression values from GLDS-7 and GLDS-120 datasets. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used as the measure of correlation (between −1 to 1) and gene pairs are considered co-expressed if their p-value is less than or equal to the corrected threshold p-value. The t-test is used to establish if the correlation coefficient is significantly different from zero, and, hence there is evidence of an association between the two variables. The genes are treated as nodes and the relation between them is an edge. Therefore, the genes with the highest degree are related to a higher number of target or authority genes. Those genes that have the highest degree or intramodule (within graph) connectivity are treated as hub genes to construct the gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Vertices (u,v) are the edges (arcs), respectively. A graph is weighted if each edge e is assigned a real-valued weight w.

Joint conditional probabilities are represented by a graph in a Bayesian network, the nodes (genes) are connected by the Markov property which states that a node is conditionally independent of its nondescendants, given its parents. Applying the faithfulness condition, the IAMB of any node (gene) in a BN is the set of parents, children, and spouses (the other parents of their common children) of the gene. We determine the direct causes of a gene’s upregulation, the effects on a gene or a protein due to the upregulation of the gene, as well as the upregulation of the causes of the activation of the gene. In our case, each gene is a variable with a series of expression values. The Markov blanket of a gene X is the smallest set MB(X) containing all genes carrying information about X that cannot be obtained from any other gene. The MB(X) of a node (gene) X includes its parents, children, and spouses which are the strongly relevant genes to gene X; that is, of genes that support and are associated with the target gene (X). Association measures and conditional independent tests are applied to identify the strongly relevant genes. Hence, MB(T) is a causal structure learning algorithm useful for the discovery of regulatory interactions among genes from gene expression data.",

GSEA is used to extract subnetworks of significant DDR processes with a majority of higher activations of radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes. Radiation-induced ATR/ATM hub genes are identified in the subnetworks. In these subnetworks, genes that have strong correlations with radiation-induced ATR/ATM genes are detected. The genes significantly altered due to other spaceflight parameters that are not correlated with ATR/ATM genes are not detected. Network measurements listed in Section 2D are computed and used to analyze the subnetworks. Certain non-radiation-induced genes that interact with the radiation-induced hub genes are detected in the DDR processes subnetworks. The associated processes and molecular functions of the key non-radiation induced genes that interact with the ATR/ATM radiation-induced hub genes are identified. Flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis processes are identified from the Pearson GRNs and MB causal relational networks and their corresponding subnetworks are extracted. The carotenoid and flavonoid hub genes are detected in the subnetworks.

In a causal graph, for any node (gene) X, its parents and children are the immediate nodes (genes) that are strongly relevant in its activation. The higher activation of a parent gene will lead to the activation of the child gene, as well. The activation of the parent gene is the cause, and the activation of the child gene is the effect. The MB(AT1G27940) has six children genes, and the MB(AT3G60420) has two parent genes, which indicates that this gene has a causal relationship with these two other genes.

            "text": "Radiation data for GLDS studies in the ISS are provided in. Previous studies of Arabidopsis in spaceflight missions have focused on non-radiation stress responses that are due to microgravity, although radiation is an important stressor in spaceflight. The effect of ionizing radiation has been presented using traditional fold change analysis methods in. The novelty of our approach is the performance of computational modular subnetwork analysis of biological processes involving a majority of radiation-induced genes. Our modular analysis approach provides a better insight into the complex gene interaction profiles between radiation-induced and non-radiation-induced genes in DDR processes. We have also determined gene associations using the Bayesian Markov blanket method which identifies key genes based on the relevance of gene associations. This method is attractive because of its ability to describe complex stochastic processes with noisy observations. We have used IAMB innovatively in identifying causal relations between ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes and non-radiation-induced genes. We have innovatively used the Jaccard similarity index to show the similarity of neighborhood interactions of ATR/ATM genes in the subnetworks for DDR processes. This index is not biased by low-level, noise-derived, variability in expression. We have also shown how topological network measures of degree distribution are useful for the extraction of subnetwork modules from larger GRNs. The subnetworks sampled from the original GRNs also have a scale-free topology with a degree distribution that follows an exponential power law. Centrality measures are useful for distinguishing protein complexes. It has been shown that the subgraph centrality has better discriminatory power than other centrality measures such as Eigenvector, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Subgraph centrality has been used here to distinguish the hub genes involved in the DDR processes. The network measures of diameter, connected components, and density have important biological implications as they can predict gene regulatory interaction landscape intrinsic to the organism. The density is the lowest for the LRD2 dataset indicating the sparseness of the subnetworks. The network measures for the subnetworks reveal quantitatively different emerging properties for Arabidopsis grown in different radiation dose environments. The number of connected components and diameter of the subnetworks for the DDR processes show large variability for low and very high radiation doses. The spectral gap has large values in the very high radiation dose subnetworks than in low radiation dose subnetworks indicating sparseness and high connectivity of the networks. Many biological systems are modular which results from the sparseness in the GRNs. The novel algebraic analysis using spectral gap computations informs us about the diffusion, mixing, and expansion properties of important genes in different radiation dose environments. Through spectral analysis, we have shown that very high doses of radiation, results in large complex biomolecular networks with higher values of the spectral gap. Several machine learning methods such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest regression, naïve Bayes classifier, stochastic gradient boosting, and artificial neural networks have been applied to gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes. The advantage of logistic regression is that it allows the evaluation of multiple explanatory variables. It is easy to implement, interpret, and train. It is better than linear regression which produces continuous output, while logistic regression produces discrete output. This method has ranked the ATR/ATM hub genes of low radiation dose subnetworks, and 50 ATR/ATM genes as the top gene players responding to DNA damage and/or ionizing radiation in spaceflight. ",

The MB causal relational subnetworks show the ATR/ATM genes related with genes that regulate root development, and plant growth, indicating that increased radiation tolerance by genetic activations may have a side effect on the plant growth. This fact has to be considered while genetically engineering plants for DNA repair response which may have undesired side-effects such as reduced yield. Further experiments are necessary to study the effect of long-term exposure of plants to space radiation and the best mechanisms to overcome the harmful effects of radiation. The overexpression of several genes and their side effects may be averted by suitable enclosures that can shield the plant from spaceflight radiation. ",

There is a significant difference in the regulation of these processes in a low radiation dose environment where ATR/ATM radiation-induced genes interact with many downstream genes, whereas in the very high HZE and γR radiation dose environment, the DDR processes are regulated chiefly by ATR/ATM genes.",
