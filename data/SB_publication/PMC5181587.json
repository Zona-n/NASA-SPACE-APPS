            "text": "Gravitropism in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the sedimentation of amyloplasts in the endodermis, and a complex interplay between the vacuole and F-actin. Gravity response is inhibited in zigzag-1 (zig-1), a mutant allele of VTI11, which encodes a SNARE protein involved in vacuole fusion. zig-1 seedlings have fragmented vacuoles that fuse after treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and underscore a role of phosphoinositides in vacuole fusion. Using live-cell imaging with a vertical stage microscope, we determined that young endodermal cells below the apical hook that are smaller than 70 Î¼m in length are the graviperceptive cells in dark-grown hypocotyls. This result was confirmed by local wortmannin application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls, which enhanced shoot gravitropism in zig-1 mutants. Live-cell imaging of zig-1 hypocotyl endodermal cells indicated that amyloplasts are trapped between juxtaposed vacuoles and their movement is severely restricted. Wortmannin-induced fusion of vacuoles in zig-1 seedlings increased the formation of transvacuolar strands, enhanced amyloplast sedimentation and partially suppressed the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 seedlings. Hypergravity conditions at 10 g were not sufficient to displace amyloplasts in zig-1, suggesting the existence of a physical tether between the vacuole and amyloplasts. Our results overall suggest that vacuole membrane remodeling may be involved in regulating the association of vacuoles and amyloplasts during graviperception.",

            "text": "Plants have the capacity to sense and respond to the direction of gravity by precise modulation of growth patterns in roots and shoots. Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing. Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes. This is supported by evidence that (i) mutants lacking an endodermis display agravitropic shoots, (ii) starchless mutants or mutants that lack amyloplasts show reduced gravitropism, (iii) hypergravity restored gravitropic sensitivity in starch-deficient mutants, and (iv) there is significant movement (sedimentation) of amyloplasts following gravistimulation. The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin. The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases.",

            "text": "The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response. Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established. Mutants with vacuolar defects, including mutant alleles of SHOOT GRAVITROPISM6 (SGR6), VTI11/ZIGZAG-1 (ZIG-1)/SGR4, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS22 (SYP22)/SGR3 and KATAMARI2 (KAM2) were identified from screens for agravitropic shoots in Arabidopsis. A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case of zig-1 mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced. Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion. Two mutant alleles of VTI11, zig-1 and impaired traffic to tonoplast3 (itt3), have multiple vacuoles per cell. Treatment of itt3 and zig-1 with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism. This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein, and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling. The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown.",

            "text": "A tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane. Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time. TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments. It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception, but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs. However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences. Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly, kat2 mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles, but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified.",

Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls, reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells or have no effect in experiments with live cells. An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of the shoot gravitropism9 (sgr9) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin. SGR9 encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation. The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts.",

The fragmented vacuoles in endodermal cells of zig-1 hypocotyls restrict amyloplast movement, contributing to the agravitropic phenotype of this mutant. We show that application of Wm to zig-1 enhances their gravitropic response, restores amyloplast sedimentation and enhances the formation of TVSs.

The vacuole was visualized in WT and zig-1 using the pSCR::TIP1;1-GFP marker in order to determine the relationship between the vacuole and amyloplast in seedlings. As expected, a large central vacuole occupies most of the volume of WT endodermal cells and the tonoplast surrounds the sedimented amyloplasts (Fig. 1C). In contrast, zig-1 displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype in shoot endodermal cells, as previously described for other tissues. It is important to note that amyloplasts do not sediment in zig-1 mutants and appear to be trapped at the junction between two or more adjacent vacuoles (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, and similar to zig-1 inflorescences, the tonoplast does not tightly surround the amyloplasts in zig-1 hypocotyls. These results indicate that the vacuole phenotype of zig-1 impinges on the distribution of amyloplasts in hypocotyl endodermal cells and likely prevents their sedimentation.",

Sequential images were acquired at 10 s intervals for 3 min in the vertical stage (Fig. 2A).

In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts were found more widely distributed in the cell between 0 and 3 min, and they were severely limited in their movement as shown by their comparatively static tracks (Fig. 2C). Next, seedlings were rotated 90Â° and imaged immediately for the following 3 min (Fig. 2A).

Figure 4A shows the orientation of the seedlings throughout the experiment. No obvious differences in amyloplast dynamics were observed in WT seedlings 3â8 min after Wm application (Fig. 4B, 3â8 min) when compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2B). Additionally, amyloplast movements still appeared severely limited in zig-1 when seedlings were imaged within 8 min of Wm treatment (Fig. 4C, 3â8 min). After 90 min of Wm treatment, WT amyloplasts were still sedimented in the direction of gravity, but the amplitude of saltatory movements seemed reduced (Fig. 4B, 90â93 min). In contrast, 90 min of Wm treatment in zig-1 resulted in many amyloplasts being found at the bottom of the cell (Fig. 4C, 90â93 min), compared with the untreated zig-1 (Fig. 2C). Seedlings were then rotated 90Â° and they were again imaged for 3 min immediately after. Upon reorientation, WT amyloplasts sedimented to the new gravity-associated cell bottom within 3 min (Fig. 4B, rotation). Finally, several amyloplasts in Wm-treated zig-1 sedimented in the direction of gravity following reorientation and their tracks were more similar to WT (Fig. 4C, rotation).

However, Wm treatment for 90 min restricted amyloplast movement in WT to within 10 Î¼m of their initial position (Fig. 4D, 90â93 min). Again, most amyloplasts were able to translocate to the new gravity-associated bottom of the cell following the reorientation (Fig. 4D, rotation). In contrast, Wm treatment of zig-1 mutants had dramatic effects on amyloplast movement. Initially, zig-1 amyloplast movement was highly restricted to within 5 Î¼m of their starting position immediately after Wm application (Fig. 4E, 3â8 min) in a similar fashion to untreated seedlings (Fig. 2C). However, after 90 min their range of motion had increased to within 10 Î¼m, and sometimes up to 17 Î¼m from their original position (Fig. 4E, 90â93 min). After rotation, several amyloplasts were able to relocate to the bottom of the cell and move up to 30 Î¼m (Fig. 4E, rotation).

            "text": "We have shown above that statocytes in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl may be located just below the hook (Fig. 1). To confirm this, we took advantage of the effect of Wm on zig-1 vacuoles and amyloplast sedimentation (Fig. 4). Thus, we tested whether local Wm application to either the top or bottom of the hypocotyl was sufficient to restore gravity response in zig-1. A small dot of growth medium containing either 1% (v/v) DMSO (control) or 33 Î¼M Wm was placed over the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl. The plates were then rotated 90Â° from the original gravity vector and the angle of hypocotyl curvature (Î±) was measured after 20 h (Fig. 5A). Col-0 WT responded to the new gravity vector when DMSO (control) was placed at the top of the hypocotyls, while zig-1 displayed an agravitropic response, as expected (Fig. 5B). When medium containing Wm was placed at the top of Col-0 hypocotyls, it induced a slight delay in graviresponse as indicated by an increase in the seedlings with an angle between 0 and 30Â° and a decrease in those between 30 and 60Â°. However, local application of Wm to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls resulted in an enhanced response to gravity. zig-1 mutants treated with DMSO showed a strong agravitropic phenotype, with most seedlings in the â30 to 0Â° and 0 to 30Â° categories, while zig-1 mutants treated with Wm at the top showed an increase in the hypocotyls between 30 and 60Â° and a decrease in those between â30 and 0Â° (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that Wm application to the upper hypocotyl partially suppresses the agravitropic phenotype of zig-1 mutants. In contrast, application of Wm to the bottom of the hypocotyl did not have major effects on gravity response in zig-1 (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, only local Wm application to the top of zig-1 hypocotyls can enhance their gravitropic response.",

            "text": "The dramatic restriction on amyloplast movement in zig-1 prompted us to determine if fragmented vacuoles altered the morphology of organelles of the endomembrane system, which could impede their flow. To this end, VHA-a1-GFP, a marker for the trans-Golgi network (TGN), and mCherry-HDEL, a marker for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), were analysed in the zig-1 background. Organelle morphology was analysed in hypocotyl cortical cells given the weak fluorescence of these markers in the endodermis. VHA-a1-GFP labeled typical TGN structures in WT and the zig-1 background (Fig. 6AâD). Not surprisingly, TGN puncta were found both in the cell cortex and in the cytosol that surrounded fragmented vacuoles of zig-1 (Fig. 6C, D). Therefore, loss of VTI11 does not appear to have an effect on TGN morphology. The mCherry-HDEL marker showed the canonical ER network organization at the cell cortex and ER bodies in WT (Fig. 6E, F). The ER was found surrounding the small vacuoles of zig-1, similar to the other organelles, but two distinct abnormalities could be detected. First, the cortical organization of the ER was altered as there was enrichment of ER membranes in the cortical domains that abutted juxtaposed vacuoles (Fig. 6G). In addition, aggregates of ER were found in the cytosolic domains between juxtaposed vacuoles and these appear to have restrictions in their movement (Fig. 6H and Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). These aggregates of ER could result from accumulation of fusiform bodies at these sites, in addition to aggregated ER membranes, but these are difficult to differentiate at the resolution of a light microscope. These defects indicate that vacuole morphology is important for proper ER organization. To further test this possibility, we determined whether Wm treatment of zig-1 would restore the cortical ER organization by promoting vacuole fusion. There were no apparent changes to the ER network in WT hypocotyls after treatment with Wm (Fig. 6I, J), although membrane aggregates were sometimes observed. As expected, Wm treatment induced the fusion of vacuoles in zig-1, and the enrichment of ER membranes was no longer observed in the cortex after a 2 h washout (Fig. 6K, L). These results overall indicate that vacuole morphology defects in zig-1 do not alter the morphology of the TGN, but it does have a dramatic effect on the organization of the ER.",

Because amyloplasts appear trapped between fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 1) and are relatively static (Fig. 2), it was important to investigate if F-actin or microtubules were involved in restricting their movement. The cytoskeleton was visualized using the F-actin marker ABD2-GFP or microtubule (MT) marker TUA6-GFP in cortical and medial sections of epidermal cells (Fig. 7). F-actin cables were observed at the cortex in zig-1 (Fig. 7C) similar to the WT (Fig. 7A), except that the F-actin network surrounds the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 (Fig. 7C). We conclude that the fragmented vacuoles in zig-1 do not impede F-actin polymerization or cortical arrangement. Similarly, microtubules were detected in the cell cortex in WT (Fig. 7E) and zig-1 (Fig. 7G). However, dense MT arrays were also observed close to juxtaposing vacuoles (Fig. 7H).

No changes were observed in zig-1, with or without Lat-B, as most zig-1 hypocotyls were found in two categories, â30 to 0Â° and 0 to 30Â°, in both treatments (Fig. 8A). The ABD2-GFP marker was included in these experiments as a control to show the effectiveness of the Lat-B treatment (see Supplementary Fig. S3A). A possible role of MT in tethering of amyloplasts was also tested (Fig. 8B). There was a delay in the response of the oryzalin-treated seedlings, with an increase in the proportion of seedlings in the 0â30Â° category and a decrease in the 60â90Â° category. In the case of zig-1, both treatments resulted in very similar angle distributions, with almost all seedlings bending to an angle between â30 and 30Â°.

To confirm this, amyloplast sedimentation was visualized after inhibitor treatment in the endodermis of dark-grown hypocotyls (see Supplementary Fig. S3B). In this experiment, seedlings were incubated overnight in the presence of DMSO, 2 Î¼M Lat-B or 20 Î¼M oryzalin to depolymerize the cytoskeleton.

In contrast, zig-1 amyloplasts did not sediment in either of the chemical treatments as shown by their static localization before and after reorientation (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Since depolymerization of F-actin or MT does not enhance gravity response in zig-1, nor does it restore amyloplast sedimentation, these results overall indicate that actin filaments or microtubules are not contributing to the immobile nature of amyloplasts by serving as a physical tether connecting amyloplasts and tonoplast.

Previous studies have utilized cuttings from inflorescence stems. Our microscope set-up allowed us to image endodermis through the almost transparent cortex of etiolated hypocotyls using a fluorescence microscope. A very small amount of Immersol allowed us to use a water immersion objective on the vertical stage, which provided optimal resolution. This unique set-up allowed us to track amyloplast sedimentation in real time and in whole plants without the concerns of plant injury. The system is amenable for cell biology analysis, including treatment with chemical inhibitors, and long-term time-lapse experiments. Furthermore, this system can overcome the challenges of imaging using stem cuttings, which have been shown to affect the vacuole morphology of certain mutants. One caveat of our system is the need to illuminate the seedlings during image acquisition, which we have addressed with a green filter to minimize phototropic responses. Green light, however, has been shown to enhance hypocotyl growth and inhibit blue and red phototropic responses in dark-grown seedlings. Therefore, experiments in the vertical stage must be interpreted with caution as they may be influenced by effects of the green light on seedling growth.",

            "text": "A role for the vacuole in gravity perception or response is well documented. The VTI11 loss of function mutant sgr4/zig-1 was originally identified for its agravitropic phenotype in shoots, and it was later shown to display abnormal vacuole morphology and reduced vacuole fusion. We used zig-1 and a second allele, itt3, as tools to interrogate the role of vacuole dynamics on gravitropism in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. As expected, WT endodermal cells from hypocotyl statocytes show a large central vacuole and sedimented amyloplasts that appeared surrounded by tonoplast membrane. This organization is very similar to that found in inflorescence stems. In contrast, and consistent with other tissues, smaller unfused vacuoles were detected in endodermal statocytes from zig-1 mutants, where the amyloplasts were found distributed almost randomly throughout the cell. In these cells, amyloplasts appeared trapped at the junction of juxtaposing vacuoles, and this organization seems to prevent amyloplast movement in zig-1, both before and after gravistimulation, as depicted by time-lapse experiments. Surprisingly, conditions of hypergravity up to 10 g were not sufficient to force amyloplasts to sediment in these cells. It is unlikely that the fragmented vacuoles alone would be sufficient to prevent the movement of these organelles simply by creating physical obstacles to their movements along the cytosolic space. Therefore, we propose that a physical tether exists between the vacuole and amyloplasts that is of sufficient strength to resist a 10 g force. In fact in the case of zig-1, each amyloplast seems attached to multiple vacuoles, which perhaps generates a strong physical tethering structure to resist this hypergravity pull. In contrast, hypergravity is known to increase amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of other agravitropic mutants such as sgr2, sgr9, and pgm, but none of these mutants displays a fragmented vacuole phenotype. Amyloplast sedimentation has been shown to occur via transvacuolar strands, and therefore we asked whether the fragmented vacuole phenotype of zig-1 could impair TVS formation. In fact, zig-1 mutants formed very few TVS structures in epidermal cells when compared with the WT, which could contribute to the reduced sedimentation of amyloplasts inside their statocytes. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype of the sgr2 mutant, which displays fewer TVSs than WT and is agravitropic.",

We used this assay to test whether the vacuole morphology phenotype of zig-1 was necessary for their lack of amyloplast sedimentation and the role of vacuole morphology on this movement. As expected, Wm treatment increased amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1. The Wm-induced vacuole fusion may have this effect due to the following: (i) vacuole fusion could disrupt the putative tethers between amyloplasts and the vacuolar membrane proposed above and therefore increase mobility of these organelles; (ii) vacuole fusion could restore the ability to form TVSs, which could become conduits for amyloplast sedimentation; (iii) restoring the single vacuole phenotype could remove physical obstacles formed by the vacuoles themselves. We indeed confirmed that Wm-induced vacuole fusion increases the formation of TVSs in epidermal cells. However, TVSs alone are probably not sufficient because sgr2 mutants, which do not form TVSs in stems, were able to reposition amyloplasts along a hypergravity vector. Future research is needed to address the role of a putative tethering system to determine if all three possibilities play a role in this response. The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present.",

Visualization of endodermal cells in the medial region of the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings indicated that most cells did not show the expected sedimented amyloplasts, and instead these organelles were in constant motion from cytoplasmic streaming. Only the smaller cells in the upper hypocotyl of an average length of 70 Î¼m or less showed sedimented amyloplasts that were consistent with graviperception. To confirm this result, we took advantage of the phenotype of zig-1 and Wm treatment. This provided a unique opportunity to test whether amyloplast sedimentation in zig-1 at the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl was associated with restoration of gravitropism. Adding Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhanced gravitropism in these mutants, but the treatment at the bottom did not. Therefore, only Wm treatment at the top is sufficient to restore the gravity response. This effect is correlated with an increase in amyloplast sedimentation as shown by organelle tracking experiments. Altogether, these results indicate that the statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are localized to the young endodermal cells at the top of the hypocotyl. These results are consistent with the top ~4 cm region of the inflorescence stem being sufficient for graviresponse in mature plants and the finding that displacement of amyloplasts at the base of the inflorescence stem does not result in inflorescence bending.",

            "text": "A role for actin during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear. The inability of amyloplasts to sediment in zig-1 could be due to the fragmented vacuoles being obstacles for movement. However the fact that hypergravity is not sufficient to release them indicates that there may be physical tethers between the amyloplasts and the vacuole. We tested whether such tethers could be formed in part by cytoskeletal structures and, therefore, if they could be disrupted with inhibitors that depolymerize MT and actin microfilaments. However, neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatment was sufficient to overcome the block in sedimentation. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin B in wild-type inflorescences. However, these results are not consistent with experiments in flowering snapdragon shoots, in which depolymerization of actin microfilaments with Lat-B released amyloplasts. We conclude that the association between amyloplasts and the vacuole may occur either directly or indirectly but does not seem to involve the cytoskeleton. Contact sites between the vacuole and other organelles and association between those and amyloplasts may be responsible for the tethering that we have observed. Contact sites between plant subcellular organelles have been identified by electron microscopy or laser trapping, including between ER and plasma membrane (summarized in), ER and endosomes, and ER and Golgi. The vacuole has also been shown in tight association with the cytoskeleton and the ER, and the latter may provide an anchoring system that may be important to regulate amyloplast sedimentation. Future analysis by electron microscopy in shoot endodermal cells may provide further support for these contact sites. The dramatic effects on ER morphology in the zig-1 mutant indicates that ERâvacuole interactions are critical for organelle structure. Given that no major changes in organelle morphology or distribution were observed for the TGN, we conclude that the vacuole is unlikely to form physical attachments with these organelles as it does for amyloplasts.",
