The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant health and production. To that end, we developed a methodology to investigate the transcriptional activities of the microbiome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host–microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results show that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and could be an effective approach for the on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a potential method for on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.",

            "text": "Plants have complex and dynamic relationships with their microorganisms, which are influenced by various stresses and environmental factors, including spaceflight. The novel environments of spaceflight and microgravity analogs have been shown to alter the plant–microbe interactions at both the genetic and physiological levels, oftentimes resulting in increased susceptibility to diseases. For example, soybean seedlings grown in spaceflight are more susceptible to the colonization of fungal pathogen, Phytophthora sojae, when compared to ground controls. In addition, simulated microgravity experiments have demonstrated that clinorotation reduces the growth and development of the legume Medicargo truncatula and significantly affects its symbiotic relationship with the rhizobium Sinorhizobium meliloti and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus irregularis. Specifically, nodule size and number were reduced under clinorotation when compared to static controls. Moreover, in another simulated microgravity experiment performed on random positioning machines, the endophytic bacterial diversity in wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings behaves differently under simulated microgravity when compared to normal gravity controls. Specifically, some bacterial genera (e.g., Pseudomonas, Paenibacillus, and Bacillus) that can produce plant growth-promoting and antimicrobial substances, exhibit clear differences in relative abundance between microgravity and Earth gravity treatments. However, research on how microgravity impacts plant–microbe interactions is still in its infancy. It is, therefore, critical to develop efficient methods for investigating plant–microbe interactions to expand our current knowledge base for future space exploration. The dynamic nature of plant–microbial interactions requires regular monitoring of a crop’s microbiome and its metabolic activities to assess plant health. These measures together with other surveillance techniques (e.g., hyperspectral imaging) will ensure that successful cultivation of crops on long-duration missions in space can be accomplished.",

For example, edible leafy crops have been safely produced in the Veggie hardware on the International Space Station (ISS) and consumed by crew members. There have been, however, sporadic instances of contamination with opportunistic fungal pathogens. In a Veggie experiment (VEG-01C), Zinnia hybrida plants were infected by an opportunistic fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum. F. oxysporum is a ubiquitous group of soilborne fungi that are highly adaptable to different habitats and include non-pathogenic strains, plant pathogens, and even opportunistic human pathogens. Pathogenic strains of F. oxysporum can cause Fusarium wilt in nearly every agriculturally important crop. Some multi-host isolates in plants also have the potential to cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised mammals. Even though the fungal infection on the Zinnia plants was likely due to a malfunction of a fan in the Veggie hardware, it demonstrated the importance of characterizing the healthy basal microbiome of all plants cultivated in space.",

Metatranscriptomics has emerged as an effective methodology to characterize the plant microbiome and evaluate its transcriptional activity. Transcriptional surveys, among many others, enable the identification and assessment of the main drivers of changes in plant health. However, to date, metatranscriptomic studies of plant microbiomes have all utilized Illumina sequencing platforms, which are not feasible for spaceflight applications due to their large up-mass, weight, and footprint. The pocket-sized, USB-powered nanopore MinION, sequencing platform, which weighs <100 g and is capable of single-molecule sequencing of native full-length DNA and RNA molecules, has emerged as a viable sequence platform for spaceflight. In 2016, the nanopore-sequencing system was successfully used aboard the ISS for DNA analysis and compared to next-generation sequencing platforms, such as Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII. Although the nanopore system has been successfully used for DNA applications, its use for metatranscriptomic analyses is only now emerging and has not yet been used to analyze the metatranscriptome of microbial transcripts from plant–microbe total RNA samples.",

The nodes represent a KEGG Orthology (KO) gene and the lines (edges) represent the connection to similar expression patterns across the three samples. Shorter edges are indicative of closer connections, whereas longer edges show expression patterns that vary more between the samples. Transcripts that are found in only one sample were excluded. Both nodes and edges are color-coded to represent the KEGG level 3 pathways within the overarching KEGG level 2 signal transduction pathway. The gene network map generated showed two main clusters with high levels of connectivity. In cluster 1, genes associated with a diverse set of KEGG level 3 pathways were intertwined and observed to have some similarity in expression patterns across all three samples. The edges connecting each gene in cluster 1 were longer, which showed more variation in expression patterns between each sample. However, cluster 2 showed an enrichment of genes primarily associated with the MAPK signaling pathway that have remarkably similar expression patterns across all three samples as the edges between genes are shorter. This result suggests that the genes in the MAPK signaling pathway within the fungal community may exhibit a coordinated, co-expression pattern.",

As visualized in Fig. 1, there was an enrichment of the microbial RNA as the depletion of the host RNA resulted in an average loss of ~93% of the total RNA. However, it was evident that there were still residual plant RNA molecules in our library construction (Table 1). The remaining plant RNA was likely attributed to the use of a commercial plant RiboMinus kit that has not been thoroughly optimized for the lettuce species. For instance, although the lettuce 18S ribosomal sequence aligned well with the 18S probe, the incomplete lettuce 28S sequence on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database made it difficult to assess how well the kit would work on lettuce samples.",

Using the recovered host–microbial total RNA (7.33–23.56 µg), the Dynabeads poly(A) capture protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was performed to remove poly(A)-containing RNAs (e.g., plant mRNAs). Of note, plants and fungi both have poly(A)-containing mRNA. It is therefore likely that some of the fungal RNA were also removed during the enrichment process. The remaining poly(A)-depleted material (microbial mRNA/rRNA and plant rRNA) was then purified with the Zymo RNA clean and concentration kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The remaining RNAs were processed using the RiboMinus Plant Kit for the removal of plant rRNA as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The host-depleted RNA (1–10 μg) from each sample was then A-tailed using Poly(A) polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 25 min at 37 °C. The enriched microbial RNA (mRNA and rRNA) quantity was assessed with a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and quality was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). To assess the purity of RNA, A260/280 readings were also taken with the UV-1800 Shimadzu spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The samples were stored at −80 °C until library preparation.",

Apart from fungi, coding sequences assigned to viruses and other eukaryotes were excluded in the downstream analysis so as to focus on the microbial activity found associated with the lettuce leaf. In addition, transcripts derived from taxa assigned to Cyanobacteria, which represented a substantial number of reads (Supplementary Dataset 1), as well as transcripts associated with photosynthesis genes (Supplementary Dataset 2), were excluded to prevent the inclusion of possible misassigned chloroplast transcripts. Abundance of transcripts that had KEGG annotations were normalized using gene-length corrected transcripts per million method followed by Trimmed Mean of M-values method as implemented in EdgeR. KEGG-annotated association with their respective pathways were performed using the R package KEGGREST. Heatmaps were generated using the Broad Institute’s webtool Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus).
