Alpha Klotho is secreted predominantly in the kidneys, whereas FGF23 is secreted by osteocytes. FGF23 binds to αKlotho, and increases urine phosphorous excretion. Both are required, as seen in mice that demonstrate phosphate retention if either component is deficient. FGF23 also increases calcium reabsorption. Through these mechanisms, FGF23 eliminates excess phosphorus and increases plasma calcium, with subsequent decreased calcitriol synthesis and parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. In non-weight-bearing climates with known bone density loss, αKlotho and FGF23 may play a role in skeletal homeostasis.",

Use of the ARED as a single countermeasure largely maintains preflight skeletal health over a 6-month mission in orbit, but bone loss is observed by 1 year post-flight, indicating progressive atrophy despite a return to full weight-bearing and from astronauts also receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Additionally, a device as large and complex as ARED is likely not feasible on an exploration class mission due to limitations in mass and habitable space. These findings add concerns for the current ability to preserve bone health outside low earth orbit.",

Likewise, this study examined if deficits in circulating αKlotho after periods HU could be recovered after return to full-weight bearing, with/without performing exercise. Changes in α-Klotho after acute bouts of exercise are inconsistent when examining resistance vs aerobic exercise (ref. ), with long term exercise exhibiting elevated αKlotho in sedentary individuals (ref. ).
