In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in a precise manner due to the small size of the bones and difficult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed a precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to measure stiffness to prescribe force levels that produce the same specified level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups (n = 5–6 per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for a controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to 5-fold lower for the new method (F-ratio = 4.9; p < 0.01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality.",

That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass. Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments. In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured, typically stiffness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (e.g. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading. Biomechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in a precise manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance effects that are difficult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test specimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic-loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power, which in turn can lead to inconclusive findings regarding the role of bone quality.",

If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved, or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure. Thus, we developed a detailed method for this aspect of the specimen preparation (Fig. 1). Each vertebra was aligned inside a 3D-printed (Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jig with a metal pin (diameter range 0.91 to 0.99 mm; length of 38 mm) (Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in a diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under constant irrigation to remove only the endplates (Fig. 1B), preserving the maximum amount of bone tissue. A final cut through the posterior pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig (Fig. 1C).",

The fixed errors have implications for external validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within any given experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However, large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when sample sizes are <10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors associated with machine compliance, we used a computationally derived stiffness (KFEA) that was obtained from specimen-specific, micro-CT-based, linearly elastic, voxel-based finite element analysis. The models used 10-μm sized cube voxels, and assumed a nominal value of 10 GPa for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (see Appendix A for details). The specimen-specific cyclic forces (Fmin; Eq. 1 and Fmax; Eq. 2) were then calculated for each specimen using KFEA, the specimen height (H) as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain (εmin = 0.05% and εmax = 0.5%):",

The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens can be challenging, the upper platen comprised a spherically-seated platen on a lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to rotate and mate flush with the sample surface to achieve uniform contact (Fig. 3); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper platen are locked. We used a compressive pre-load of 1 N, and after the platen was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X, pH 7.4) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged. The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined Fmin, and then sinusoidal cycles of compression between Fmin and Fmax were applied at a frequency of 8 Hz until the specimen reached 10% strain, measured via the actuation of the testing device platens.",

Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted, and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creep strain, and damage strain (Fig. 4B). The total-strain curve was used to find the number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life (Nf) and strain to failure (εf) using the point of intersection between the curve and a 0.5% line offset parallel to a line of best fit for the secondary region. Third, we plotted stiffness per cycle (Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic stiffness of the specimen (Kelastic), stiffness at failure (Kf), and rate of stiffness degradation. Elastic stiffness was calculated as the average stiffness over ±500 cycles centered about the maximum value of stiffness (Kmax), which typically occurred after a few thousand cycles of loading; the stiffness at failure was defined as the stiffness measured at cycle Nf; and the rate of stiffness degradation (ΔK/ΔN) was calculated as the slope of a line that best fit the middle 50% of points in the range between Kmax and Kf.

Failure of bone in both static and fatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled. To apply a repeatable initial strain to each specimen, a consistent measurement of stiffness must first be obtained. Our new method utilized specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analyses to measure specimen stiffness and prescribe an individualized cyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces resulted in a consistent starting level of strain applied to all test specimens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our implementations of the two literature methods were unable to consistently apply the specified starting strain value, which produced more scatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended S-N-like relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this method would be particularly helpful for studies limited to a small sample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection in cyclic properties.",

While the fatigue life will depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as a more uniform outcome across many different cyclic loading experiments. Our strain-to-failure (mean ± SD) value of 3.20 ± 0.80%, from cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with cyclic compression results for other species: 3.36 ± 2.13% for human trabecular bone, 2.85% ± 0.66% for bovine trabecular bone, and 4.19 ± 1.52% for rat whole-bone vertebra. A similar value in cyclic compressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might be expected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the collagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain-to-failure of the bone, is similar amongst the species listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniform values for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied loads, or temperature. While the absolute value of strain to failure will be influenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agreement and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed fail at a narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across different specimens.",

We observed a reduced Kelastic and fatigue life for the KEXP method compared to the new method, even though the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and microarchitecture (Appendix B; Table 1). We attribute these inconsistent results to the rigid platen design used in the KEXP method testing. Even with rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly plano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be achieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to an area that comes into contact with the platen first, producing an effective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reduced stiffness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used in this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random assignment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimens differed across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of specimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis (Appendix B; Table 1) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be in tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals were of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial strain values of (εmax = 0.5%) used for our new method may be specific to this particular protocol, which assumed an effective tissue modulus of 10 GPa in the finite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen empirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, such that the resulting Fmax values were approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models, large or small (e.g. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to determine the value of εmax is suggested, particularly if it is suspected that the effective tissue modulus might differ from mouse vertebrae. We recommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about half of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the effective tissue elastic modulus reported here are specific to this experiment. Parameters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of different platens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation between tests, thus the effective tissue modulus should not be considered a true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platens directly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance effects. However, it is best to use the effective tissue modulus as a relative measurement to compare between untreated and treated specimens within an experiment, but not across studies (e.g. between mouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomechanical testing, the loading configuration does not mimic exact in vivo conditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via a rigid platen versus loading via intact disc and endplate is a clear limitation. Thus, while our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our protocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help elucidate changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or treatment.",

            "text": "The main application of our new method is to provide greater statistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment. A small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue testing present challenges for detecting statistically significant effects unless those effects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. found a 37.5% difference in steady-state creep rate and 15.7% difference in loss of stiffness with zoledronate treatment in an osteoporotic rat model, but could not report a detectable significance due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXP method was similar to their method, which produced standard deviations in fatigue life (reported as “time-to-failure”) up to the same magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that range up to 8-fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (e.g. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (e.g. spherically-seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. That said, our new method is a time intensive process for specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and finite element analysis. However, the extra effort improves the ability to detect small differences across treatment groups without using a large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (e.g. space flight experiments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future studies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment.",

All bone elements were assigned the same elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poisson's ratio of 0.3. These values are based on experimental testing of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae. A varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and thus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach. Each model was uniaxially compressed to 2% apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical models contained approximately 1.5 million elements and were solved using a highly scalable, implicit parallel finite-element framework Olympus running on a Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole-bone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational stiffness, KFEA (Eq. 4), by dividing by the input displacement.",

The computed cyclic loading force for KEXP group was retrospectively found to demonstrate the difference in standard deviation of cyclic loading force computed with the KEXP method compared to KFEA method (F-ratio = 10.9; p < 0.01). The structural parameters from specimens of the FMAX method are not compared to KEXP and FMAX method groups because of a difference in resolution of these micro-CT scans (20.7 μm).

Max Stress is calculated from the resulting maximum force found from monotonic testing of the L4 (i.e. σ = FL4/AL4). This maximum stress is a material property and assumed to be the same for the adjacent L5 bone. The cyclic loading force applied to the L5 was derived from this stress (i.e. Fapplied = 0.5(σ)(AL5)), labeled “50% of L5 Max Force” in the table. The range in applied force calculated led to a larger standard deviation in fatigue life when compared to the new method KFEA.",
