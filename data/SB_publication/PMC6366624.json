Sequencing methods usually rely on some form of amplification, often a massively multiplexed PCR prior to sequencing. To eliminate potential biases and create a data set that could be used for other studies, our lab compared unamplified sequencing results from the splenic heavy-chain repertoire in the mouse to those processed through two commercial applications. We also compared the use of mRNA vs total RNA, reverse transcriptase, and primer usage for cDNA synthesis and submission. The use of mRNA for cDNA synthesis resulted in higher read counts but reverse transcriptase and primer usage had no statistical effects on read count. Although most of the amplified data sets contained more antibody reads than the unamplified data set, we detected more unique V-gene segments in the unamplified data set. Although unique CDR3 detection was much lower in the unamplified data set, RNASeq detected 98% of the high frequency CDR3s. We have shown that unamplified profiling of the antibody repertoire is possible, detects more V-gene segments, and detects high frequency clones in the repertoire.",

            "text": "Antibodies are B cell proteins that play a vital role in adaptive immunity. These complex molecules, and their diverse specificities are defined at several levels. At the protein level, these molecules are heterodimers joined with disulfide bonds between heavy and light chains. At the genetic level, the antibody specificity is influenced by semi-randomly recombining a variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments that are encoded in the genome. This V-D-J, or in the case of the light chain, V-J rearrangement, also influences antibody specificity by random and semi-random base insertions or deletions during the recombination process. In the end, the collection of antibodies produced, the antibody repertoire, is a fingerprint of what antigens an organism has been exposed to and a measure of immunocompetence. Sequencing has become easier, cheaper, and faster in recent years. Antibody repertoires have been sequenced in numerous species, in response to vaccinations and infections, and have been employed in cancer detection; providing valuable feedback regarding the immune system’s response to challenges and for early cancer detection in patients.",

Concurrent with performing these analyses, we discovered that the required sample preparation for commercial sequencing also varied. Therefore, we found it necessary to examine the impact of sample preparation as part of our effort. This manuscript describes our results comparing a data set generated using unamplified total RNA (TRNA) to commercially amplified data sets. We examined the role of commercial amplification and cDNA generation methods as well as the impact of the starting material on sequence output.",

The raw sequencing results from Com1 and Com2 were also submitted to IMGT for analysis and subjected to the standard KSU bioinformatics pipeline. IMGT’s nomenclature and classifications were used throughout this paper. We assessed all functional V-gene segments as identified by IMGT.

We wanted to assess the comparability of amplified and non-amplified data from identical samples. In preparation to do this comparison, we found that different commercial amplification methodologies required different types of sample preparation. For example, sample submission for the Com1 data sets required a cDNA sample. The Com1 process amplified the resulting cDNA using proprietary primers and sequencing on the Illumina platform. After an initial submission showed a low correlation between the Com1 sequencing and the KSU data set (data not shown), we hypothesized that cDNA preparation plays a role in determining the amplified repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the role of starting material (mRNA or TRNA), reverse transcriptase (AMV vs MMLV), and primer templates (oligo-dT or random hexamer) on the sequenced B cell immunoglobulin repertoire.

The Com2 mRNA data set contained 99 detectable V-gene segments and the TRNA contained 100. Comparisons of V-gene segments in the Com1 data set to the KSU data set showed moderate R2 values; 0.4457 to 0.5841 (all p<0.0001) (Table 3). The Com2 data sets also showed moderate R2 of 0.6695 for mRNA and 0.6607 for TRNA (all p<0.0001). To determine why there were differences in V-gene detection, we compared the results from the most commonly detected V-gene segments in the KSU data sets to their frequencies in the Com1 and Com2 data sets. The protocol for Illumina sequencing uses mRNA selection, SuperScriptIII reverse transcriptase, and random hexamer primers. To best compare results, we used the Com1 mRNA-MMLV-Hex data set and the Com2 mRNA data set using the top 34 V-gene segments in the KSU data set. These V-gene segments comprise over one percent of the detected repertoire and are considered highly expressed.

To determine how extensive the discrepancy is between amplified and unamplified data, we assessed the read depth (number of reads generated) and resampling efficiency of CDR3 (number of unique CDR3s resampled between replicates) using technical replicates of samples sequenced with the various sequencing techniques.

This allowed us the ability to look at CDR3 sampling reproducibility and to determine if amplification provided any advantage in CDR3 reproducibility. For the KSU unamplified data set, two C57BL/6J mouse spleen RNA samples (#32 and #39) were sequenced independently two times each and the CDR3s sampled were compared. In the KSU data set, 32-1 shared 28% of its total unique reads with 32-2. (Figure 3). 32-2 shared 24% of its reads with 32-1 (Figure 3).

For the Com2 data, since there was such a strong correlation between the sequence output between mRNA and TRNA samples of C57BL/6J spleen samples (R2 = 0.9644), we considered these technical replicates. The mRNA data set shared 24% of its sequences with the TRNA data set while the TRNA data set shared 30% of its sequences with the mRNA data set. We also examined the resampling efficiency in the Com1 data set using the spleen mRNA-MMLV data sets that were reversed transcribed with two different primers, random hexamer and oligo-dT. Although this was not a perfect technical replicate, there was an R2 of almost 0.94 in V-gene segments detected (Figure 1). Therefore, we felt these served as “incipient” technical replicates. The random hexamer data set shared 20% of the detected CDR3s and the oligo dT data set shared 32% of its CDR3 sequences.

Additionally, transcripts from the germline which are not successfully rearranged can be detected. Therefore, avoiding bias is one of the main priorities for antibody repertoire sequencing. PCR errors are accumulated through the amplification process which can falsely inflate the repertoire or they can add suspected mutations that do not exist and they may not be distinguishable from low level mutations that actually do exist in the repertoire. PCR biases can be introduced because of primer binding properties, CG content, mispriming, non-specific binding, and errors during replication. A specific issue in targeting antibody gene segments is primer annealing efficiencies since the gene segments that make up the murine IgH locus are similar, though not identical. The biases inherent in the multiplex PCR can lead to false repertoire skewing, gene frequency inaccuracies, and a less comprehensive view of the repertoire. The development of these multiplex primers, is highly challenging. Work by Bashford-Rogers shows that there is little difference between RNA-capture, 5’RACE or PCR amplification in humans but others have shown that PCR does create biases and 5’ RACE helps reduce these.",

While reproducibility for technical replicates was moderate to high, there was a large range of total read numbers across methodologies. Given the increase in read results with mRNA samples compared to TRNA samples, the authors hypothesize that mRNA increases the availability of antibody specific transcripts, increasing the overall read counts. Additionally, the reverse transcriptase plays a role in sequence generation. AMV reverse transcriptase has an RNase H activity, where MMLV reverse transcriptase does not. This activity may cleave RNA transcripts prior to completion of amplification, resulting in shorter reads with inadequate length for amplification. The use of oligo-dT primers will begin reverse transcription from the most 3’ end of the transcript. The target of amplification is around 1.5 kilobases upstream of the poly-A tail, likely leading to shorter reads and failure to amplify the region of interest. Random hexamer primers maybe able to overcome this bias due to their random priming nature.",

The absence of these genes draws into question how one compares the various data sets with correlation coefficients that are below 0.7 when technical replicates of the same sequencing are greater than 0.99. Although Carlson et al. argues that amplification methodologies can capture the entire repertoire, there are concerns. Even when we only looked at the V-gene families detected at the highest frequency there were omissions. Of the 34 V-genes that we categorized as “high frequency” (>1% of the repertoire), Com1 found lower detection levels (defined as less than two-fold that found in the KSU data set) for five gene segments (V1-26, V1-18, V1-50, V4-1, and V2-6) and nine (V9-3, V4-1, V2-6, V1-, V5-17, V2-2, V8-8, V11-2, V14-2) for the Com2 data set.

The difficulty in developing a “universal” or even highly comprehensive primer set for the mouse is likely due to their highly varied leader sequences, V-gene segments, and framework regions. Primer design would have to rely on massively multiplexed reactions and/or degenerate primers. Additionally, the most commercially viable amplification methods would need to amplify across multiple common strains adding additional levels of complexity. Indeed, in our attempts to design “universal” primers, we found a minimum of 11 primer sets would be needed to detect V-genes associated for each isotype. Even then, there were still issues with matching PCR conditions and efficiency. Methods to overcome the biases detected in amplification have been developed, such as the use of 5’ RACE and using molecular barcodes or identifiers. However, these methods are expensive and have their own draw backs. Replication of the entire repertoire using 5’RACE would still require the use of multiple constant region primers, leading to the same multiplexing issues.

The use of oligo-dTs can result in enhancement of the 3’ end of transcripts. We do not think this is particularly problematic since Illumina sequence methodology aims to reduce bias in their library preparations by combining the random hexamer and oligo-dT capture. Additionally, while all libraries were sequenced on the Illumina platform, 3.19% of high-quality Illumina reads contain false base calls, which are impossible to differentiate using normal bioinformatics methods. Over representation of specific dineuclotides can also be detected in sequencing which are not related to primer usage. Therefore, although we hope to reduce bias and omission by doing RNASeq, we still have some technical issues that keep the data set from being a perfect reflection of the repertoire. Multiple technical replications help reduce the impact of this problem.",

CDR3 resampling was similar (20-32%) regardless of method. Additionally, when examining high frequency CDR3s, the unamplified data set only failed to detect a single unique CDR3 sequence, while the Com1 data set failed to detect four. Without using an amplification method with unique barcoding, such as that used in Shugay et al it is impossible to tell which unique CDR3s are, in fact, correctly identified new sequences and which involve miscalls, leading to false diversity. As our current paper does not focus on the actual diversity of the repertoire, and instead focuses on the differences among sample preparations and sequencing methods, we do not attempt to identify false call unique CDR3s as doing so may falsely reduce diversity. Instead, the we used strict read quality cutoffs to prevent low quality base calls from being included in analysis, and we point to our highly overlapping V-gene segment usage (R2 = 0.9995 among multiple sequencing replicates to assure us that we minimized artifacts. Additionally, all sequencing was performed on the Illumina platform, so false base call rates should be similar across methodologies which we were focused on in this study.",
