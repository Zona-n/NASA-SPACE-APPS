The C. elegans cuticular surface serves as a barrier and first point of contact with their microbial environments. In this study, we identify microbes from C. elegans natural habitats that associate with its cuticle, constituting a simple “skin microbiome.” We rear our animals on a modified CeMbio, mCeMbio, a consortium of ecologically relevant microbes. We first combine standard microbiological methods with an adapted micro skin-swabbing tool to describe the skin-resident bacteria on the C. elegans surface. Furthermore, we conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies to identify relative shifts in the proportion of mCeMbio bacteria upon surface-sterilization, implying distinct skin- and gut-microbiomes. We find that some strains of bacteria, including Enterobacter sp. JUb101, are primarily found on the nematode skin, while others like Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 are predominantly found in the animal’s gut. Finally, we show that this skin microbiome promotes host cuticle integrity in harsh environments. Together, we identify a skin microbiome for the well-studied nematode model and propose its value in conferring host fitness advantages in naturalized contexts.",

We demonstrate that members of a modified C. elegans model microbiome, mCeMbio, can adhere to the animal's cuticle and confer protection from noxious environments. We combine a novel micro-swab tool, the first 16S microbial sequencing data from relatively unperturbed C. elegans, and physiological assays to demonstrate microbially mediated protection of the skin.

Microbiomes play a significant role in shaping host physiology, adaptation, fitness, and even behavior. Organisms and their microbial inhabitants share their first interactions at the integument of the host. This enveloping layer, whether it be skin, membranes, or a cuticle, plays an essential role in host–microbe relationships and may act as a barrier to promote host survival. These essential roles coupled with dynamic microbial communities provide a valuable interface to study host–microbe interactions. Emerging studies specifically focus on the effects of single, pathogenic bacteria, which are often localized to the gut, on animal behavior and physiology. Although single-species studies allow a thorough investigation of host–microbe interactions, individual microbial species do not fully recapitulate entire communities of microbes. Moreover, a majority of these studies focus on pathogen invasion mechanisms of the skin or pathogen–commensal microbial interactions, whereas host–commensal dynamics at the skin surface remain impactful but understudied.",

Despite the subtle implication of surface-adherent bacteria, host–microbe interaction studies at the surface layer are often focused on pathogens. In the wild, C. elegans are found in rotting organic matter filled with microorganisms. Therefore, an interaction between external microbes and the worm’s integument—the cuticle—is inevitable and likely a dynamic process, Moreover, these nematodes rely on their cuticle health to protect against environmental stressors such as harmful toxins, desiccants, or pathogens. The function of the C. elegans cuticle and its many structures have been explored using mutants in the underlying genes. Animals with defective cuticle structures display a number of phenotypes including motor abnormalities, a higher susceptibility to chemically induced cuticle degradation, and protection from skin pathogens. Several modes of fungal and single-bacterial adherence and pathogenesis have been characterized, including Leucobacter strains known to externally invade C. elegans surfaces. However, interactions involving ecologically relevant commensals and, moreover, communities of microbes that represent wild C. elegans encounters remain underexplored.",

Together with their genetic tools and transparent bodies, C. elegans have recently gained attention in microbiome studies. In the laboratory setting, a single bacterium Escherichia coli (usually a single strain, OP50) serves as the animal’s food source and external environment and minimally colonizes the C. elegans intestine for most of its life. However, E. coli is not a substitute for a microbiome of C. elegans nor is it extensively associated with the nematode in the wild. A recent meta-analysis of the C. elegans intestinal microbiota produced a comprehensive analysis of the host’s natural gut inhabitants. This collaborative effort prompted the creation of the C. elegans microbiome (CeMbio), a model microbiome consisting of the 12 most abundant gut bacteria families naturally associated with C. elegans. Individual isolates from this consortium are known to affect growth, food choice behavior, and physiology, as well neural degradation through metabolite secretion. However, these studies only consider the influence and composition of CeMbio bacteria in the gut and have not examined their potential impact at other body sites, like the cuticle.",

The examination of nematode microbiomes in the absence of stringent surface bleach sterilization may provide worthwhile insights into the effects of a comprehensive, complex, and natural microbiome on cuticle physiology and host biology.",

We then conduct 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize a skin microbiome on animals reared on complex microbiomes similar to CeMbio, which we call modified CeMbio (mCeMbio, Table 1). Importantly, we find that the microbiome of non-sterilized C. elegans is microbially distinct from the microbiome of the C. elegans gut and the surrounding environment. We identify skin- and gut-dominant isolates of this microbial consortium that demonstrate distinct attachment strengths to the cuticle. Finally, we show that colonization with mCeMbio and with several mCeMbio isolates confers protection for the host against noxious stimuli.",

            "text": "We sought to directly identify the existence of a resident skin microbiome on the C. elegans cuticle. However, existing microbiological techniques on the nematode are designed to isolate the entirety of the animal’s microbiota rather than skin microbes. We postulated that the entire microbiota consists of gut-resident and surface-resident microbes and that these parts can be separated with varying intensities of surface-washing steps (Fig. 1A). For instance, surface-sterilization, hereafter referred to as “bleaching,” removes all skin bacteria and isolates gut-resident bacteria (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we hypothesize that animals with more skin-resident bacteria will demonstrate larger decreases in bacterial counts following bleaching. Using a colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, we assessed the existence of surface-adherent microbes on animals reared on OP50 or mCeMbio. First, we observe greater CFUs from animals reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50 (Fig. 1B). We also observe no significant difference between the number of CFUs from whole animal lysates that were serially washed or bleached after being reared on OP50 (<103 bacteria per worm, Fig. 1B). However, we observe a significant decrease in the number of CFUs from whole animals after bleaching (<104 bacteria per worm) compared to serially washed animals (>106 bacteria per worm). From these data, we find that animals reared on mCeMbio, but not OP50, harbor skin-resident bacteria. Moreover, to account for free-living bacteria that are not in contact with the skin, we analyzed the CFUs from supernatants after a series of washes. We observe that there are OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria present in the supernatant after washing three times, which might reflect transient gut or skin microbes that have been shed, and highlight the limited extent of these methods for identifying skin-resident microbes.",

This reusable glass tool is swabbed across the length of each animal (Fig. 1C). To eliminate non-adherent, free-living microbes and enrich for putative skin-resident microbes, we compare unwashed animals (“crawl”) to animals that have been washed once or three times. As a negative control, we include animals that have been bleached. Swabs from animals reared on OP50 indicate that OP50 grows from lawns and unwashed animals, but even washing once eliminates all skin-associated OP50 bacteria (Fig. 1D; Fig. S1A and C). Specifically, growth curves of OP50 from singly (1X) and triply (3X) washed animals are indistinguishable from the swabs from bleached animals (Fig. 1E). Swabs from animals reared on mCeMbio indicate that viable bacteria can be isolated from lawns and unwashed animals as well as animals that have been washed up to three times (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B and D). Growth curves of mCeMbio from animals washed up to three times had ~7 fold higher levels of bacteria compared to bleached animals (Fig. 1G). These findings suggest that there are significant populations of adherent mCeMbio bacteria on the C. elegans cuticle that are removed by standard bleach-based surface-sterilization protocols.",

We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing on bleached C. elegans, serially washed C. elegans, and their bacterial lawns. In two separate experiments, we discovered that the bacterial communities of bleached animals have a microbiota that is distinct from those of animals that have been serially washed. In bleached animals, we observed significantly higher levels of Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19 and Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71, while unbleached animals contain more Enterobacter sp. JUb101 and Sphingobacterium multivorum BIGb0170 (Fig. 2A through C). Despite significant differences between the relative abundance of bacteria across experiments 1 and 2 (Fig. S2A through C), we observe consistent differences in microbiota composition of bleached and serially washed animals, both of which are distinct from bacterial lawns (Fig. 2E and F). These data suggest that bacterial communities of bleached animals are significantly different than those of serially washed animals, as evidenced by Bray–Curtis distances (PERMANOVA, Fig. 2G and I). Furthermore, within-sample alpha diversity, expressed as the Shannon index, of each treatment group is similar, but mCeMbio bacterial lawns display greater diversity than bleached or serially washed C. elegans in experiment 2 (Fig. 2H and J). Our data suggest that the composition of the C. elegans skin microbiome is stable over time; we observe that only one bacterial species shows a significant change in abundance between 2 and 8-day-old washed (unbleached) animals, while the microbiome composition between 2 and 8-day-old bleached animals shows reduction in only two species (Fig. S2D and E). Collectively, we suggest that the microbiota of C. elegans with an intact skin microbiota is distinct from the microbiota of the C. elegans gut and further distinct from the environment on which the animals were raised. Specifically, we hypothesize that species more abundant in bleached animals (JUb19 and MYb71) are more gut-specific, whereas species more abundant in serially washed animals (JUb101 and BIGb0170) are more skin-specific.",

After 72 hours of growth, no discernable differences between swabs from animals that were unwashed (“crawl”), washed once, or washed thrice after exposure to CBX151 were observed (Fig. 3C; Fig. S3A and B). Similarly, swabs from animals reared on JUb101 grow regardless of the number of washes (Fig. 3D). After 72 hours of growth, swabs from JUb101-reared animals that have been washed once are not distinct from those of unwashed JUb101-reared animals, but are distinct from those of bleached animals (Fig. 3E; Fig. S3C and D).

We hypothesized that bacteria associated with the cuticle (JUb101, BIGb0170, and CBX151 as a known skin-adherent control) would protect animals from noxious environments more than gut-associated ones (JUb19 and MYb71). To test this, we performed a cuticle resistance assay by treating animals with a harsh (5%) bleach solution (Fig. 4A). In this assay, the time to burst is a readout of cuticle integrity and a potential indication of the protective roles that bacteria may have on worm physiology. We found that wild-type animals reared on CBX151 and mCeMbio community take significantly longer to burst compared to OP50 controls and therefore exhibit greater cuticle resistance (Fig. 4B). Animals were also reared on mCeMbio isolates individually, and we observed a range of impacts on cuticle integrity. Some bacterial species, including gut-resident Ochrobactrum MYb71, significantly promoted cuticle integrity with longer times to burst. Other bacteria, including the skin-associated JUb101 and gut-associated JUb19, did not alter animal burst times compared to OP50. Sphingomonas JUb134 was the only mCeMbio strain to significantly decrease host cuticle integrity, further supporting that most mCeMbio strains are nonpathogenic in this context. However, neither JUb101 nor JUb19 consistently change C. elegans cuticle burst time on their own (Fig. 4B). This suggests that interspecies interactions present in mCeMbio may promote cuticle protection or the N2 wildtype C. elegans strain lacks sensitivity in this assay and masks the subtle impact on the cuticle.",

            "text": "To test this, we assessed how these bacteria affect animals with disrupted cuticle structures, thereby sensitizing the assay. We tested animals with mutations in cuticle-related genes: bus-8, dpy-8, srf-3, and dpy-10 (Fig. S4A; Table S1). All genes are known to affect cuticle integrity. Bus-8 is predicted to encode a glycosyltransferase, enabling proper cuticle molts and leading to disordered epidermal morphogenesis in strong mutants. Dpy-8 and dpy-10 are collagen genes that, upon disruption, cause loss of cuticular annuli structures. Srf-3 encodes a nucleotide sugar transporter, and mutants have altered cuticle surface compositions that confer biofilm resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated bus-8 (e2698) mutants as more sensitive in the cuticle resistance assay, while dpy-10 mutants have been shown to be more stiff than wild-type animals and express the innate immune gene nlp-29 at high levels constitutively, while also being more permeable to a Hoescht staining protocol, suggesting a multifaceted role for dpy-10 in protection and permeability. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared bus-8 mutants are significantly shorter (time to burst = 25 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds), as previously observed in literature (Fig. 4C and D; Fig. S4A). Despite a disordered epidermal morphology and disrupted cuticle integrity in bus-8 animals, mCeMbio consistently promotes cuticle integrity (time to burst = 39 seconds) compared to OP50 (time to burst = 25 seconds) (Fig. 4D). To normalize across multiple experiments and variable times to burst, we evaluated the fold change in burst time compared to animals raised on OP50. We observed significant differences in the fold change in burst time of bus-8 animals raised on mCeMbio and JUb19 compared to animals raised on OP50, with mCeMbio providing 1.4-fold increases in burst time and JUb19 providing a 1.3-fold increase; JUb101 does not significantly increase the fold change in burst time but shows variability between experiments (Fig. S4B through D). Interestingly, the cuticle-adherent CBX151 caused either parental death or suppressed growth in bus-8 animals, preventing us from testing this condition consistently in this cuticle mutant background. Cuticle burst times of OP50-reared dpy-10 mutants are significantly longer (time to burst = 145 seconds) than of N2 animals (time to burst = 93 seconds) (Fig. 4C and E). Dpy-10 animals raised on CBX151 (time to burst = 457 seconds), mCeMbio (time to burst = 302 seconds), JUb19 (time to burst = 219 seconds), or JUb101 (time to burst = 291 seconds) display noticeably longer cuticle burst times compared to dpy-10 animals raised on OP50 (time to burst = 145 seconds) (Fig. 4E). This relationship is consistent with the fold change over OP50 observed for animals raised on CBX151 (3.9-fold), mCeMbio (2.3-fold), JUb19 (1.9-fold), and JUb101 (2.2-fold) (Fig. S4D). Given the consistency of increased cuticle integrity in both wild-type and cuticle mutants reared on mCeMbio compared to OP50, bacteria–bacteria interactions likely impact C. elegans bleach sensitivity. Moreover, dpy-10 mutants reared on JUb101 or JUb19 promote cuticle protection compared to OP50, unmasking a subtle yet consistent impact of these bacteria on the cuticle. Despite being a single species, CBX151 is also a consistent promoter of cuticle integrity, suggesting a role for adherence to cuticle structures still present on dpy-10 and bus-8 mutants.",

Consequently, the study of ecologically relevant bacterial communities is often traded for the simplicity of single species. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of ecologically relevant communities of bacteria and uncover a C. elegans skin-resident microbiome. We reared animals on a natural C. elegans microbiota, mCeMbio, and discovered that most of the mCeMbio bacteria can be removed by bleaching protocols, suggesting that these bacteria may reside on the cuticle surface (Fig. 1A and B). We observed that our surface-sterilized worm CFU counts match those in previous findings, whereas serially washed, unbleached worms have significantly more bacteria (Fig. 1B and 3A). We conjectured that there are abundant skin-resident bacteria, approximating counts from simplified arithmetic of [# unbleached CFU] – [# bleached CFU] – [# supernatant CFU] (Fig. 1A). To supplement this finding, we developed and implemented a novel micro-swab to isolate skin microbes from C. elegans cuticles. We measured the growth of swabbed OP50 and mCeMbio bacteria from C. elegans cuticles and observed distinct and repeatable patterns of relative growth between washing conditions (Fig. 1D through G); more washes are required to remove mCeMbio bacteria from the cuticle, implying that mCeMbio contains surface-adherent bacteria.",

Although our two independent sequencing experiments revealed different proportions of microbes (Fig. S2A and C), both experiments suggest that there are distinct communities in animals with intact microbiomes compared to those without surface microbes (Fig. 2C through J; Fig. S2B). Importantly, the microbiomes from animals with cuticle-adherent microbes are distinct from those of their bacterial lawns (Fig. 2G and I), indicating some level of selection on the surface of the cuticle. Although we cannot confirm whether the composition of the supernatant from washed animals, which is composed of loosely attached bacteria, is similar to or distinct from the environment or animal surface, we focused on the more strongly attached bacteria. We further confirmed the persistence of skin-resident microbes compared to more gut-resident microbes by measuring bacterial growth from skin swabs of animals reared on these species (Fig. 3D through G). We hypothesize that multiple species within mCeMbio may also associate with the C. elegans cuticle to varying degrees.",

We conducted a well-established cuticle fragility assay and observed the consistent role of mCeMbio and CBX151, a known cuticle-adherent bacterium, to promote cuticle integrity in the host, which varies across the individual bacterial species in mCeMbio (Fig. 4A and B).

Several species of bacteria found in association with C. elegans are known to, directly and indirectly, protect against pathogens in the worm intestine. Other protective benefits may be derived from diverse nutritional or metabolic mechanisms unique to the mCeMbio bacteria. This may provide an indirect mechanism by which gut-dominant bacteria, like MYb71, are able to protect the cuticle. Moreover, both known skin-resident bacteria and members of the mCeMbio consortium have been shown to prime the cuticle against other infections. This protection may even be attributed to the potential hydrogen peroxide-degrading capabilities of the mCeMbio consortium, which have been observed in strains of E. coli. Importantly, we sought to examine skin-enriched microbes and the mCeMbio consortium as a whole, which involves both bacteria–bacteria and host–bacteria interactions. This is highlighted by greater cuticle resistance in animals raised on the mCeMbio community (time to burst = 277 seconds) compared to all but one of the individual mCeMbio members, the gut-enriched strain Ochrobactrum MYb71 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that most single host–bacteria interactions may not fully recapitulate the extent of interactions in our system and demonstrates the importance of studying communities of ecologically relevant microbes.",

However, we have not confirmed that these mutant animals can be vessels for bacterial growth on their skin, given their disrupted state.

            "text": "Interestingly, the washed (unbleached) C. elegans with mutations in cuticle genes display 16S profiles different from those of the washed (unbleached) wild-type animals. These differences are most starkly observed in the decreased abundance of putative skin-adherent microbe, JUb101, and increased presence of JUb19 across nearly all of the sensitized cuticle mutant strains. We do not have data for bleached cuticle mutant strains; due to their sensitized nature, the standard bleaching protocol was too harsh for most of the animals. Therefore, we are unable to compare between washed and bleached conditions. However, we observe that mCeMbio is able to rescue the cuticle mutants, which suggests that even small populations of the strains are protective or that the protection comes from aforementioned indirect influences.",
