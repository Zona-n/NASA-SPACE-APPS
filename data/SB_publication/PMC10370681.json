Recent studies have demonstrated that the wild mouse gut microbiota promotes host fitness and improves disease resistance. Here we examine whether the wild mouse gut microbiota alters the immunopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Conventional BALB/c mice (LabC) and mice born to germ-free BALB/c mothers reconstituted with the wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) were used in our studies. WildR mice controlled initial TB infection better than LabC mice. The microbial gut communities of LabC mice and WildR mice had similar richness but significantly different composition prior to infection. TB reduced the gut community richness in both cohorts while differences in community composition remained indicating a general TB-induced dysbiosis. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in the BALB/c model that includes unstructured immune cell infiltrates with infected foamy macrophages invading alveolar spaces. Animals of both cohorts mounted robust T cell responses in lungs and spleen with lower absolute counts of CD4 and CD8 T cells in lungs of WildR mice during acute infection, corresponding with observed differences in pathogen load. In summary, LabC mice and WildR mice showed largely overlapping TB immunopathology and pathogen kinetics, with WildR mice controlling early acute infection better than LabC mice.",

            "text": "Laboratory mice have played a critical role in TB preclinical therapy development and studies of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) immunopathology. However, they do not always align closely with clinical observations. Most of the common mouse strains used in research have been inbred for many decades under specific pathogen-free conditions in a controlled environment without dietary variations that led to a loss in microbiota diversity and richness. Moreover, laboratory animals are not exposed to microbes that wild-living mice constantly encounter. Several studies have highlighted that exposure to microbes and pathogens, including mites and pinworms, and the presence of the wild mouse microbiota may improve the translational value of murine models and better reflect human immune responses. However, introduction of murine pathogens to research poses significant challenges for laboratory animal facilities and is often prohibitive because such pathogens are notoriously difficult to contain. Rosshart et al. have defined the wild mouse gut microbiota, which was significantly more diverse and various species were differentially represented as compared to conventional laboratory mice. Reconstitution of germ-free laboratory mice with the wild-mouse gut microbiota enabled their offspring, termed “WildR” by vertical transfer, to experience microbiota-mediated effects before and after birth. The gut microbiota of WildR mice was stable over several generations, promoted host fitness and improved disease resistance to influenza virus infection and mutagen/inflammation-induced colorectal tumorigenesis. A recent study showed that previous intestinal infections in WildR mice increase the gut microbiota’s resistance to subsequent infections by inhibiting pathogen respiration. Taken altogether, WildR mice have demonstrated translational value in several research fields owing to their wild mouse gut microbiota.",

            "text": "The onset and recurrence of active TB infection in humans are characterized by a decline in the diversity of the gut microbiota. Similarly, mice experience a rapid loss of fecal microbiota diversity upon Mtb infection. Depletion of the microbiome by broad-spectrum antibiotics rendered mice more susceptible to TB and restoring the gut microbiota by fecal transfer reduced the bacterial load of Mtb. Chemotherapy with first-line antimycobacterials led to dysbiosis that persisted beyond the end of drug treatment for at least 3 months in Mtb-infected mice and at least 1.2 years in TB patients. Taken altogether, the crosstalk through the gut-lung axis is bidirectional and impacts both Mtb in the lung and the microbial community of the gut. Because there are striking differences between the microbiota of laboratory mice and wild-living mice, we examine whether laboratory mice reconstituted with the wild-mouse gut microbiome may better resemble the hallmarks of clinical TB than conventional laboratory mice. We chose the BALB/c mouse as the host organism for our studies as this strain is widely used in TB preclinical development. Here we investigate the impact of the wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB infection in the BALB/c model using organ bacterial burden, lung histopathology, microbiome changes, cytokine profiles, and T cell responses as readouts.",

To study the impact of wild-mouse gut microbiota on TB, we simultaneously infected both cohorts in the same aerosol generator chamber by a low dose of aerosolized Mtb. Strict separation between the two animal groups was maintained during the infection process and throughout the experiment to prevent microbiome transfer. We verified delivery of the initial inoculum dose at 24 h post-infection and monitored the progress of TB thereafter by determining the pathogen load of organs at 14, 28 and 56 days. The study design is depicted in Fig 1A. The course of low dose Mtb infection in mice can be divided into the acute phase characterized by rapid Mtb growth (until ~4 weeks), and the chronic phase during which a high pathogen load in organs is maintained. The lungs of WildR mice at 1 day and 14 days post-infection had a significantly lower bacterial burden than LabC mice, and this difference dissipated thereafter (Fig 1B left). In contrast, animals of both cohorts had a similar pathogen load in the spleen at individual time points (Fig 1B right). This suggests that the gut microbiota may shape innate immunity leading to different degrees of TB control in WildR mice and LabC mice in the early time points following infection. Dissemination of TB to secondary organs such as the spleen was not affected by the gut microbiota.",

Laboratory mice have been bred under specific pathogen-free conditions for many generations which led to alteration of their gut microbiota, and consequently, changes in their immune responses relative to wild living mice. It has been reported that TB infection has a profound impact on the gut microbiota of humans and mice. To investigate whether the gut microbiota impacts the course of TB in the BALB/c model, we used animals born to germ-free mothers that were inoculated with the gut microbiota of wild-living mice, and age-matched conventional BALB/c mice. Fecal samples obtained from individual mice of both cohorts prior to and during TB infection were subjected to DNA isolation and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region.

In support of this, we assessed the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of samples collected during TB infection compared to pre-infection samples. Infection with TB significantly increased the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of microbial community relative to pre-infection samples within the first 14 days of infection and persisted through day 56 (Fig 2C).

Interestingly, Roseburia are butyrate-producing bacteria that are associated with beneficial health outcomes in mice and in humans. WildR mice were enriched for Odoribacter (Family Marinifilaceae), Helicobacter (Family Helicobacteraceae), and genera within the Rikenellaceae family.

Most cytokine and chemokine levels were much higher in the lungs than in the spleens (S1 Fig). We thus performed principal component analysis to explore if different gut microbiomes would affect cytokine expressions in response to TB infection (Fig 5). Cytokine profiles of mice from the same time points tend to cluster together regardless of their gut microbiome. This suggested that measured cytokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In summary, our data shows that the fecal microbiome impacts early T cell responses during acute infection which did not translate into changes in the cytokine profiles.",

Mice having the gut microbiota of their wild-living relatives have better host fitness, improved disease resistance and might model humans more closely. Here we tested whether introducing the wild mouse gut microbiota to the BALB/c host (WildR) would alter the representation and course of TB infection. Conventional BALB/c mice with the microbiome of continuously inbred animals (LabC) served as a reference. Consistent with previous reports, the compositions of the intestinal microbiomes of LabC and WildR mice had differently composed microbial gut communities (Fig 2D). The WildR mice were enrichen in Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota, whereas Bacillota and Actinobacteriodota were enriched in the LabC mice. Both LabC mice and WildR mice had microbiome taxa that are not common in specific pathogen free research environments and might be specific to our animal supplier’s facility. Helicobacter and Odoribacter were enriched in WildR mice. Colonization of the murine gut with Helicobacter hepaticus was associated with increased Mtb growth, elevated inflammation through CD4 and CD8 T cell activation and more sever pulmonary pathology. In contrast, Helicobacter pylori infection was associated with immunoprotection against TB in macaques and in humans. The presence of Helicobacter species (H. bilis, H. ganmani, H. hepaticus, H. mastomyrinus, H. rodentium, H. typhlonius) that are part of the WildR gut microbiota were beneficial or had no impact on TB infection in our studies. TB infection caused a major perturbation of the intestinal microbiome of both cohorts and induced a significant loss in community richness during the chronic infection stage (Fig 2A). Roseburia species, were more abundant in LabC mice than in WildR mice. The higher abundance of Roseburia might be beneficial for mice during chronic TB infections. Our data is consistent with previous reports indicating significant differences in the relative abundance of members of the Lachospiraceae family in response to TB infection.",

            "text": "LabC mice showed the typical biphasic course of pulmonary TB infection, including the acute phase until day 28 followed by the chronic phase. While in principle WildR mice phenocopied the pathogen kinetics of LabC mice, the number of bacilli detected in lungs was lower at 1- and 14-days post-infection (Fig 1B). The observed difference in lungs did not impact dissemination to the spleen (Fig 1C). Both cohorts share the same genetic background, were age-matched and were infected simultaneously in one infection chamber while maintaining strict separation between microbiomes. Therefore, a comparable Mtb dose was likely deposited in lungs of all study animals. The lower lung bacterial load we observed at 1- and 14-days in WildR cohort might indicate a better early innate immune control in these mice, which quickly faded at later study time points (Fig 1B). The axis of innate immunity and the microbiome is an area of ongoing research. Germ-free mice for instance have a profoundly altered innate immune system and the gut is a signal hub that integrates environmental inputs to affect immunity and the response to infection. The communication of the intestinal microbiota and innate immunity is bidirectional. In line with this, we find that Mtb triggers gut microbiota dysbiosis, and in turn the wild mouse microbiome may have impacted the early events of TB infection when innate immune responses dominate. Growing evidence suggests that TB susceptibility is impacted by the microbial community in the gut (reviewed in) and our results further support this key finding.",

The cytokine and chemokine profiles we measured in infected organs of LabC and WildR mice showed a large overlap (S1 Fig). A principal component analysis of data revealed a clear separation of animals by time points post-infection but not between microbiomes (Fig 5), demonstrating that cytokine and chemokine profiles during TB infection are independent of the gut microbiota. In a high-dose influenza A infection model using C57BL/6 mice, the wild mouse gut microbiota led to significant changes in cytokine profiles and was protective. Such high-dose pathogen models typically assess immunity in a short time window after inoculation which was not the focus of our experiments. The nature of the infectious agent, the vastly different inoculation dose, the mouse strain and the choice of experimental endpoints may have contributed to the lack of cytokine profile changes in our studies.",
