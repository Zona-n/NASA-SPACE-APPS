Moreover, in the case of peptide natural products (PNPs), it is possible to predict the corresponding putative structures based on the genes present in their biosynthetic gene clusters (Oman and van der Donk, 2010; Stachelhaus et al., 1999). However, the structure of PNPs usually differs from these predictions due to post-translational modifications applied by the enzymes in the biosynthetic gene cluster. For example, in the case of polytheonamides, the PNP has 49 residues, with 21 post-translational modifications, making it nearly impossible to predict the PNP structure solely based on the genomic data. Therefore, in addition to genome mining, metabolomics methods including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance are routinely used for determining the structure of the molecular product of biosynthetic gene cluster (Doroghazi et al., 2014).",

            "text": "This paper focuses on the integration of computational mass spectrometry and genome mining for discovering unknown Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs). RiPPs are a rapidly expanding group of natural products with applications in pharmaceutical and food industries. RiPPs are produced through the Post Ribosomal Peptide Synthesis (PRPS) pathway. Initially, RiPPs are synthesized as precursor peptides encoded by RiPP structural genes. The RiPP structural genes are often short, making their annotations difficult. The precursor peptide consists of a prefix leader peptide appended to a suffix core peptide. The leader peptide is important for the recognition by the RiPP post-translational modification enzymes and for exporting the RiPP out of the cell. The core peptide is post-translationally modified by the RiPP biosynthetic machinery, proteolytically cleaved from the leader peptide to yield the mature RiPP, and exported out of the cell by transporters. The precursor peptide and the enzymes responsible for its post-translational modifications (PTMs), proteolytic cleavage, and transportation are usually located within a contiguous biosynthetic gene cluster of the RiPP. The length of a microbial RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene cluster typically varies from 1,000 to 40,000 bp (average length 10,000 bp). Since RiPP-encoding biosynthetic gene clusters are much longer than the current length of short reads generated by next generation sequencing, DNA assembly is a critical part of any RiPP discovery approach based on short reads.",

The discoveries of coelichelin in Streptomyces coelicolor and orfamide in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 were the first examples of genome mining that were followed by discoveries of various bioactive RiPPs in microbial samples. Donia et al. discovered lactocillin, a thiopeptide antibiotic from the human vaginal isolates that showed activity against vaginal pathogens. Zhao et al. discovered eight novel lanthipeptides with antibiotic activity from a ruminant bacterium. Freeman et al. and Wilson et al. used metagenome mining of a sponge to assign a biosynthetic gene cluster to the known RiPP polytheonamide, with post-translational modifications distributed across 49 residues. Thus, large-scale metagenomics projects, such as Earth Microbiome Project, American Gut Project, and Human Microbiome Project, have the potential to contribute to RiPP discovery, provided that improved bioinformatics tools for the enhanced identification of novel RiPPs are available. However, discovery of lactocillin and other recently identified RiPPs were not achieved by an automated process, but rather used time-consuming manual analysis that required the isolation of microbes, and the purification of microbial metabolites. Our goal is to discover the RiPPs directly from the mass spectrometry and metagenomics information using a fully automated approach.",

Mohimani et al. introduced RiPPquest, the first automated approach to RiPP discovery by combining mass spectrometry and genome mining. This tool is based on Peptide-Spectrum Matches, which are generated by aligning predicted spectra of putative RiPPs annotated by genome mining. If a peptide-spectrum match between a candidate RiPP predicted from the assembled genome and a spectrum is statistically significant, then RiPPquest reports it as a putative annotation of the spectrum. RiPPquest resulted in the identification of the lanthipeptide ‘informatipeptin’, the first natural product discovered in a fully automatic fashion by a computer. However, RiPPquest has a number of limitations: (a) it is limited to lanthipeptides which constitutes only one of 19 classes of RiPPs, (b) it is designed for small genomes and small spectral datasets, making it rather slow in the case of large metagenomic datasets and the entire GNPS infrastructure, (c) it does not report the statistical significance of the identified RiPPs, a key requirement for any high-throughput peptide identification tool, and (d) it is limited to searches for a predefined set of post-translational modification (PTMs) and does not enable blind searches for unknown PTMs. Since RiPPquest, other tools have been developed that combine genomics with mass spectrometry based discovery. However, these tools are limited to the analysis of a single or few spectra from isolated genomes and cannot scale to search billions of spectra from GNPS against metagenomics datasets.",

This example illustrates that the motif-ORF mode may result in a four order of magnitude reduction in the number of ORF candidates as compared to the all-ORF mode. However, antiSMASH predictions are based on searching for a set of known motifs, therefore the motif-ORF mode misses some ORFs with novel RiPP motifs. BOA is based on identifying known proximal genes (“context genes”) that reside next to a RiPP, rather than by the RiPP sequence itself. Therefore, BOA has a capability to identify non-orthologous RiPP replacements if those RiPPs maintain homologous context genes. However, if the RiPPs do not have context genes, BOA may not detect those RiPPs. Also, since BOA is trained on bacteriocin context genes only, it is most suited for that type of RiPPs.",

Wewakazole was first reported by the co-authors of this paper (W.H.G.) from another Papua New Guinea collection of Lyngbya majuscula (revised to Moorea producens) obtained from Wewak Bay. Subsequently a related compound, wewakazole B was isolated from a Red Sea collection of this cyanobacterium. To validate the MetaMiner’s identification of wewakazole from strain PNG26APR06-4, reverse phase C18 column chromatography and preparative HPLC separations were successful in the isolation of 31.2 μg of this compound. The compound possessed the same molecular formula as wewakazole, C59H72N12O12, based on the molecular ion sodium adduct [M+Na]+ in the HR-ESI-MS (m/z 1163.5282, Figure S15). Its chemical identity was further confirmed utilizing 1H, HSQC and HMBC NMR data, which allowed for direct comparison with data previously reported for wewakazole (Supplementary Figure S16-S18). Moreover, the tandem mass spectrum and retention time of the isolated compound matched the data previously reported for wewakazole (Figures S19 and S20). Furthermore, the ECCD spectrum resembled that of wewakazole B, and the specific rotation showed the same sign as previously reported for wewakazole, excluding the possibility of an enantiomeric relationship of this isolate to that of wewakazole (Figure S21). Thus, the compound identified by MetaMiner was isolated and its identity was confirmed as wewakazole.",

MetaMiner identifications were validated by the isolation of the RiPP metabolite wewakezole and confirmation of its structure by orthogonal approaches, confirming that the MetaMiner prediction was correct. In contrast to the existing genome mining approaches that rely on known biosynthetic gene cluster motifs, MetaMiner in the all-ORF mode has the ability to discover unknown biosynthetic gene clusters (with previously unknown motifs) that encode novel RiPPs (e.g. Compound Bac-ISS-2196 and cyanobactin X) that are very different from all the currently known RiPPs and thus are not captured by the existing genome mining tools.
