We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.",

The emergence of roots with a gravitropic growth pattern is a critical evolution for land plants, enabling them to anchor in the soil and absorb water and nutrients. Root gravitropism features perception of gravity by the root cap and directional growth regulation mediated by auxin. In gravity-oriented roots, symmetrical distribution of auxin in root tips maintain symmetrical growth. When root growth deviates from the direction of gravity, the amyloplasts in the columella cells of the root cap rapidly sink to the plasma membrane at the bottom, triggering the activation of gravity response via LAZY proteins. Such response entails relocation of the auxin exporter PIN-FORMED (PIN) in the cells and redistribution of auxin, thus promoting asymmetric auxin flow and asymmetric cell growth to bend the root tip to the gravity direction. Mutations in auxin transporters and gravity-signaling-related proteins often lead to defective root gravitropism during vertical growth, such as root tips growing toward random directions, wavy roots, and enlarged root angles.",

            "text": "The gaseous plant hormone ethylene plays crucial roles in plant development, senescence, and stress resistance. Ethylene biosynthesis and signaling are induced by specific conditions or stresses, including flooding, drought, low temperatures, and pathogens. Ethylene signaling pathway starts with ethylene receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and ends with gene regulation in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events. When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/proteasome pathway.",

In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil. Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid. For example, excess ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis and promotes Auxin Response Factors (ARFs)-mediated transcriptional regulation to affect cell wall composition, thereby limiting the elongation of root cells. Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis. In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene. However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear.",

The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3-binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.",

We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d).

To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b).

            "text": "The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors. These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF1. We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. 4a, b). WT roots grown in water, submerged paddy soil, vermiculite or soil-vermiculite mixture showed similarly low levels of OsEIL1 (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicative of similar levels of ethylene in these media. In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm−3) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al. Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1KO/crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2KO/crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 14d, e), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. 4c, d), with the effect being greater in oseil1KO/crw1 than in oseil2KO/crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2.",

When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. 16c). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 16d). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis. When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 16e).",

            "text": "To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. 17a). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 17b), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 17b, c and Fig. 4e). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. 17d–f) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82KO/crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. 4f, g), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. 17g, h). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. 4h–j and Supplementary Fig. 18c). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. 4k, l). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. 4m). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water. The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82KO/crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.",

            "text": "In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 19a), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROS-responsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 19b). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots. The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways. To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H2DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. 5a). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. 20). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5b), which was likely induced by excess ROS and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 19e, f), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. 5b, c and Supplementary Fig. 19g, h). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. 5d, e). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.",

Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. 5f–h), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG) (Supplementary Fig. 21a). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. 21d), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. 21d).

These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. 3a), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm−3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al.). To test the strength of mechanical resistance required to rescue the crw1 phenotype, we grew the mutant and WT in agar-solidified medium varying in the hardness by adding different amounts of agar (0.3 – 1.2%, mass/volume). crw1 showed root coiling in 0.3% and 0.4% agar media (penetration resistance 1 - 6 Pa) just as in water or nutrient solution (Supplementary Fig. 2b), curvy roots in 0.6% agar (penetration resistance 19 Pa), and normal straight roots in 0.8 – 1.2% agar (penetration resistance 34 – 77 Pa) (Fig. 6a–c). Similar phenotypic responses to different concentrations of agar (0.4%, 0.8% and 1.2%) were observed when crw1 plants were grown on the surface of vertical agar plates tilted at a 10° angle to allow the root tips in contact with varying degrees of mechanical resistance (Supplementary Fig. 22).

To investigate whether Ca2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.6, a cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca2+]cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. 7a, b). Similarly, the [Ca2+]cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca2+]cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca2+]cyt.

Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. 7h, i). Addition of 100 μM LaCl3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca2+]cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. 7h, i). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl3 (Supplementary Fig. 28), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. 7j and Supplementary Fig. 29). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.",

We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30b, c). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. 30d). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. 30e), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in water-saturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. 30f), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1. In highly compacted soil, coiling-root accessions showed shorter root elongation than straight-root accessions, which is consistent with the phenotypes of crw1 and WT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 30g).",

Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments, its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. 8). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. 8).",

            "text": "The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins, and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN2. Mutations of critical genes in auxin transport (e.g. pin2, aux1, eir1), amyloplast synthesis and gravity signaling cause plant roots to display defective gravitropic behaviors during vertical growth. The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots. In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism. In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these ROS-related genes, resulting in an excessive accumulation of ROS in the root tip. Apart from OsERF82, it is possible that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also play a small role in the coiling root phenotype of crw1.",

Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H2O2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis. Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots.",

            "text": "Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion, we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in water-saturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al.. Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering three-dimensional impenetrable compactness, change direction to avoid a flat obstacle, or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope. A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces. In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations.",

            "text": "We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca2+signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca2+signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca2+signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth.",

Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. 3b). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. 31). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors.
