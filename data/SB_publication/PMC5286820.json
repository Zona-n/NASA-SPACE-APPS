            "text": "Plant roots have been long studied and yet investigations of root behavior, physiology, and biochemistry continue to be actively explored on every level. The work presented here seeks further insights into root growth strategies by focusing on two distinct growth patterns of root growth, skewing and waving. Skewing is when the steady-state growth direction of a root deviates from the direction of the gravity vector and waving is when the root undulates back and forth over time along its direction of growth. Skewing and waving have been described as gravity-enhanced touch responses, since these root patterns are notably present when a plant is grown on a tilted, impenetrable surface. Current models require that gravity pulls the root tip down onto the tilted surface, which increases the mechanical impedance to growth, and results in root skewing and root waving. However, recent spaceflight experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) on the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that certain ecotypes have roots that deviate from vertical growth (at a magnitude similar to skewing on the ground) and wave in the absence of gravity. These ecotypes that exhibit spaceflight skewing are also the ecotypes that exhibit terrestrial skewing when grown at an angle. The degree of skewing in spaceflight was consistent with previous terrestrial observations, but the waving pattern was different from what was typically observed on the ground. The causes of skewing – and subsequently, the genes involved – are currently unknown. The goal of this study is to discover which genes are associated with root skewing through transcription microarrays.",

Touch responses, or thigmotropism, involves many genes that interact with auxin and can subsequently alter growth patterns. Plants also determine their growth in relation to the gravity vector, resulting in a gravitropic set-point angle (GSA), which is most commonly associated with lateral organ growth relative to the primary organ. GSA is driven by auxin and TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB)-dependent signaling, in a process similar to gravitropism. Light can alter GSA for different plant systems, and light in general plays a role in root patterning and growth direction. Additional tropisms include halotropism, chemotropism, hydrotropism, all of which can alter root growth response (reviewed in).",

As a result, a wide variety of genes have been implicated as involved in these growth patterns. Hormone related pathways and processes are among the candidates, such as ethylene involvement in root waving and auxin and tryptophan biosynthesis in both skewing and waving. The cytoskeleton is also involved in skewing and waving, including WAVE-DAMPENED 2 (WVD2; At5g28646) and WVD2-LIKE 1 (WDL1; At3g04630) genes, which alter cell expansion through microtubule bundle organization. Many genes involved in molecular patterning, signaling, phosphorylation, and cell wall structure are also involved in root skewing and waving. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, cell expansion gene ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD3; At3g13870) with putative GTP-binding motif, CLAVATA-related genes, protein phosphatase/PP2A ENHANCED ETHYLENE RESPONSE 1 (RCN1; At1g25490), serine/threonine protein kinases WAG1 and WAG2 (At1g53700 and At3g14370, respectively), and KNOTTED-LIKE FROM ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 1 (KNAT1; At4g08150) are all associated with morphological change in root skewing or root waving. The SKU family of genes were identified through phenotypic changes in root behavior, with SKU5 (At4g12420) and related genes being involved with cell wall modification and root growth and SKU6 (At2g03680) and family being involved with cortical microtubule and directional cell expansion. While no single pathway has been identified in the literature as responsible for root skewing or for root waving, several different pathways have evidence for being involved.",

            "text": "Skewing and waving are functionally separable using genetics. The physiological separation of skewing from waving within a ecotype can be accomplished by using the environment, particularly the tilt angle of the growth plate, and can also occur in spaceflight. The degree to which growth plates are tilted is referred to as the Angle of the growth plate (Agp). Typically, plates are tilted backward such that plants are above the media surface, at Agp 45°. For many Arabidopsis ecotypes, growth at Agp 45° results in roots that both skew and wave. When growth plates are tilted forward, such that plants are below the media surface, at Agp 135°, Arabidopsis roots skew with reduced waving, similar to the pattern observed in spaceflight. Growth plates held vertically are Agp 90° and are considered as the controls for growth angle, as roots on vertical plates generally do not skew or wave.",

This overlap is illustrated by the Venn diagram in Fig. 4a. The majority of shared genes between the two data sets involved Agp 135° – the growth condition that elicited skewing with minimal waving – resulting in 11 genes, which were named the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC, Table 2; also indicated by “Y*” in Additional file 1: Table S2). Several of the HPSGC have been verified with qRT-PCR, showing similar trends to the transcriptomic microarray data [see Additional file 3]. The HPSGC are involved in a variety of cellular processes.

The genes with altered transcription identified in this comparison of Agp 135° to Agp 90° represent the pool of genes likely involved in root skewing and not waving, since they were altered in a condition that induces root skewing independent of the classical root waving patterns. WS roots also skew when grown at Agp 45°; however, the occurrence of waving at Agp 45° complicates the relationship between skewing and transcriptome at Agp 45°. It is important to note that only roots were used for the microarrays, and that lateral roots appeared to be similar across all treatments.

The transcription of these genes was altered in the same way at both growth angles, and since skewing occurred at both growth angles (Fig. 2), it can be assumed that these genes very likely play some role in the skewing morphology (Additional file 2: Table S3). A couple of the genes identified include MODIFIER OF SNC1 2 (MOS2; At1g33520; where SNC1 is SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1, CONSTITUTIVE and NPR1-1 is NONEXPRESSER OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED 1; At4g16890 and At1g64280, respectively) and BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 10 (BEL10; At1g19700, where BEL1 is a homeodomain transcription factor controlling ovule patterning; At5g41410). MOS2 is a DNA-binding gene that plays a role in the immune response pathway and in microRNA (miRNA) maturation. miRNAs are heavily involved in gene regulation. Since Col-0 roots have higher transcript levels of MOS2 at both Agp 45° and 135° than WS, it is possible that miRNAs are involved early in the signaling pathway leading toward root growth parallel with gravity. The lower levels of MOS2 in WS roots could be limiting the rate of signal transduction, changing the entire pathway, and ultimately changing root directionality and introducing root skewing. BEL10 was upregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots grown at Agp 45° or 135° (Additional file 2: Table S3). BEL10 is a transcription factor that interacts with PLP, a blue light receptor also involved in response to salt or dehydration stresses. Higher or lower intracellular levels of phosphate could alter the ability of this gene to interact downstream in phosphate signaling pathways. Additionally, inorganic phosphate depravation can influence seemingly redundant signal peptides to subsequently alter root growth, which may, in turn, alter overall root directionality and impact skewing.",

Since WS roots skewed at this growth angle and did not wave differently from roots grown at Agp 90°, the genes identified in this category were considered likely to be associated with skewing. Some of the genes in this category include RESPONSIVE TO ABA 18 (RAB18; At5g66400) and PINOID BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1; At5g54490; Additional file 2: Table S3). RAB18 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. This dehydrin-related protein is reduced after exogenous 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) application, meaning it responds directly to ethylene in addition to abscisic acid (ABA). PBP1 was downregulated in Col-0 roots compared to WS roots at Agp 135°. Since this PINOID-binding protein is upregulated by auxin, the different PBP1 levels between Col-0 and WS could indicate different auxin levels between the two ecotypes.

The list of 92 genes based on growth angle of WS (Fig. 4b; left heat map labeled “Physiology”) was compared to the list of 128 genes identified between Col-0 and WS (Fig. 4b; right heat map labeled “Genotype”), producing 16 genes that appear in both lists (Fig. 4a and b; Y* in both Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3). The majority of these 16 genes are found involving Agp 135°, shown in bold text and dark lines. Agp 135° was the growth condition that elicited root skewing with minimal waving in WS, so to have the majority of overlapping genes identified by both the physiological and genotypic comparisons represented in this Agp provides more support for their involvement in root skewing. These 11 genes are noted as the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC).",

These different signaling and environmental sensing pathways, such as salt, sugar, and darkness responses, are linked by their individual gene members. For example, ASN1, SWEET11, and HKT1 are involved in sucrose response, sugar transport, and salt signaling, respectively. These three genes, which are not co-expressed or co-localized with one another, are all co-expressed with a common gene (SWEET12; Fig. 5), which further complicates the roles of each gene involved. Other HPSGC are involved with more downstream processes. DIN2 and SIS are involved in two different environmental sensing and cell signaling processes, are co-localized with one another, and are both co-localized with ACTIN DEPOLYMERIZING FACTOR 9 (ADF9; At4g34970) and PLANT INVERTASE/PECTIN METHYLESTERASE 47 (PME47; At5g04970; Fig. 5), both of which are involved in cell wall remodeling.

Sucrose efflux transporters SWEET11 and SWEET12 were both upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 45° and 135°. SWEET11, a member of the HPSGC, was also upregulated in Col-0 roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). These genes are also associated with response to salt stress, divalent metal ion transport, and are integral in the endomembrane system. SWEET11 and SWEET12 are shown to assist in phloem unloading into the apoplast, with SWEET12 responding to CO2 as well. This sugar transport could be used for signaling, as other members of the MtN3/saliva/SWEET-family of genes are involved with ion transport and physiological process regulation. Root exudates are also involved in regulation of the surrounding microbiome and microenvironment, and these SWEET efflux proteins may be involved in shaping root growth and directionality through signaling. Additionally, ASN1 was upregulated in WS roots grown at Agp 135° and was downregulated in both Col-0 and WS roots grown at Agp 45° (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S2). ASN1 responds to sucrose starvation, and mRNA accumulation is suppressed with sugar in some tests. Additionally, both of these genes are responsive to absence of light, and may be involved in light/sugar signaling pathways (Additional file 1: Table S2). It is possible that ASN1 would be involved with the aforementioned SWEET family network.

Comparisons within WS revealed genes that responded to the angle of growth (Agp) during the process of skewing. These genes were cross referenced with transcripts differing between the WS and Col-0 genotypes to refine the list of genes that are most probably be involved in root skewing. A majority of the highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) are directly associated with environmental sensing (e.g. salt, sugar, hormones, darkness), upstream of physical growth differences (e.g. cell wall remodeling, cell division, cell elongation). Thus, pathways that respond to disparate signals from the root local environment may drive the root behavior of skewing. However, it is also possible that some of the HPSGC are responses to the altered phenotype, rather than the basis of the phenotype. In order to separate these two hypotheses, future studies could investigate the HPSGC to find the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms contributing to root skewing.",

            "text": "Roots were dissected from shoots and RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Five roots were used for each chip, and three chips were used per condition. Lateral roots were not quantified, but did not appear to be significantly different between treatments. Initial RNA concentration was determined by Eppendorf BioSpectrometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Final RNA concentration was determined on a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE) and sample quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 100 ng of total RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNA, from which biotin-labeled cRNA was generated using the 3′ IVT plus Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The cRNA was purified using magnetic beads and was fragmented. Following fragmentation, cRNA products (12.5 μg) were hybridized with rotation to the Affymetrix GeneChip® Arabidopsis ATH1 Genome Arrays for 16 h at 45 °C. Arrays were washed on a Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) using the Hybridization Wash and Stain Kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the Washing Procedure FS450_0004. Fluorescent signals were measured with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Initial data analysis was carried out using the MAS5 algorithm within the Affymetrix Expression Console software. Microarray experiments were performed at the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research Microarray Core, University of Florida. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository [GSE83242].",

Data were imported and organized in Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Gene transcripts were significant if absolute value of the fold change was greater than 1 in a base 2 logarithmic scale, as well as a raw p-value cutoff of p < 0.05. All genes meeting these criteria were considered, mitigating the risk of false positives with the benefit of identifying as many genes as possible. False discovery rate (FDR)-correction was performed for further statistical power, with q < 0.05 being indicated in Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S2 and Additional file 2: Table S3. For comparisons between Col-0 and WS cultivars, genes with altered transcripts in all three growth environments were removed if the change was near the same magnitude, within ± 1 fold change (base 2 log scale). Heatmaps were generated using Gene-E (v. 3.0.204, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Gene data was researched using g:Profiler, agriGO, ATTED-II, Biogrid, UniProt, KEGG, and STRING online databases. Additional visualization of gene networks was created using GeneMANIA.",
