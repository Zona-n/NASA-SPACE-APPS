The need for sustainability in space exploration, as well as the exploitation of space, is becoming more evident with the strengthening desire for the expansion of human activities beyond Earth-orbit, pursued by public and private sectors alike. When applied to space, the concept of sustainability has often been understood as \"ensuring that all humanity can continue to use outer space for peaceful purposes and socioeconomic benefit now and in the long term\". Until now, it mainly referred to the need to control, regulate, and remove space debris from low Earth orbit (LEO) and planetary protection (which promotes the implementation and development of the responsible exploration of the solar system, in order to protect the space environments and Earth). As humans aspire to venture into deep space, the definition of this concept shifts and expands, and the self-sustainability of mission operations becomes a critical aspect. Loop-closure, which indicates the recycling and the reuse of resources toward the establishment of a circular economy, could greatly enhance the sustainability of space exploration, and it is key not only to minimise the costs of resupply of resources from Earth but also for ethical considerations associated with space waste generation and the preservation of extra-terrestrial environments. The United Nations resolved that outer space activities should minimise impacts on the space environment, as well as on Earth, taking into account the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development.",

The approaches presented here are based on processes and technologies currently implemented on Earth at different technology readiness levels (TRL), which must be adapted to meet the specific requirements and challenges of the space environment. Selecting the most suitable bioprocess and most applicable microorganism for any given space application is non-trivial, as terrestrial technologies are rarely readily adaptable to the harsh conditions of space. Therefore, extensive research and development are compulsory to increase TRL to the point where these technologies can be successfully implemented in space. Finally, microbial biotechnologies aimed to increase the sustainability of space exploration may be translatable to Earth applications for advancement towards a circular economy, further supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).",

Carbon dioxide on the International Space Station (ISS) is currently scrubbed from the cabin air and converted in a Sabatier reaction to recover oxygen, while the by-product (methane) is vented into space. This has two drawbacks: (i) hydrogen is required as a substrate, production of which is energy intense; (ii) hydrogen and carbon are lost, requiring constant resupply. Recycling CO2 and/or methane back into the organic matter could improve loop-closure and preserve resources. Microbial bioremediation can support the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere in habitats, while also supplementing the generation of breathable oxygen. The captured carbon may be upcycled again and reintegrated into the resource cycle, e.g., for the biomanufacturing of food/supplements. Alternatively, captured carbon may be sequestered for end-use (Fig. 1), e.g., for bioconcrete production or microbial-electrolytic carbon capture, as described later. Direct air capture of CO2 could reduce the need for energy-intensive auxiliary processes and shorten the recycling loop. Researchers at the Center of Applied Space Technology and Microgravity (ZARM, University of Bremen, Germany) are exploring the application of cyanobacteria like Anabaena sp. PCC 7938 in a Martian context, taking advantage of its carbon- (photosynthetic) and nitrogen-fixing (diazotrophic) capabilities. Low carbon concentration in habitats or spacecraft yields a conversion efficiency two- to five-fold lower than with preconcentrated CO2. Hence, the most applicable approach will strongly depend on the mission scenario, in terms of size, extent and duration. Reversible carbon scrubbers combined with microbial conversion may enable a sustainable and near-closed process for deep space travel and exploration missions or initial human settlements.",

On the ISS, human waste is currently stabilised, dried and ejected from the station to burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. This method is clearly not sustainable for long-distance missions, as it represents a sink of potentially useful resources. Solid human waste could instead be used as a feedstock for production of food and edible supplements, as well as nutrients/fertiliser for microbial or plant-based Life Support System (LSS) components (Fig. 1). Many physicochemical approaches to solid waste management, such as pyrolysis or incineration, are being proposed. However, microbiologically supported processes could enhance human waste recycling by enhancing loop-closure. The European Space Agency (ESA) supported MELiSSA project (Micro-Ecological Life Support System Alternative) includes a series of interconnected bioreactors for LSS; it is a good example of how diverse types of waste-streams, including human metabolic end-products, could be upcycled using microorganisms. Although anaerobic waste processing is usually considered less time-efficient than aerobic methods, it can achieve comparable degradation rates as physicochemical processes. A two-component system, which anaerobically converts liquid and solid human waste to protein- and lipid-rich microbial biomass for food production, has been developed.",

Symbiotic bacteria are also essential in solubilizing nutrients from the environment and converting them into bioavailable forms, and improving soil fertility.

Many of the carry-along pharmaceuticals will expire during a Mars-return mission of standard duration (1.5 or 2.7 years), or have reduced potency due to exposure to the space environment, which tends to alter the active pharmaceutical ingredients and increases the concentrations of degradants or impurities.

Where necessary, microbes may also be engineered for the production of pharmaceuticals in space, which is not a trivial task, given the often complex biosynthetic routes to compounds of interest, as well as the diversity thereof. This also impacts downstream processing, given the stringent requirements for, e.g., purity, and because a one-fits-all solution rarely exists.

Certain anaerobic bacteria (so-called ‘electricigens’, e.g., Desulfuromonas, Geobacter, etc.) can reduce organic waste to generate electric current. Specifically, microbial fuel cells (MFC) utilise microbes to convert chemically bound energy into electricity. Harnessing the reducing power of organic waste to generate electricity, MFC could be coupled with in situ flow-through waste remediation systems. Such microbial systems can be categorised into dark-fermentation and photobiological processes, and they can use wet biomass from, for example, waste streams. In a similar fashion, and quasi-opposed to MFC, microbial electrosynthesis (MES) can be used to convert electricity (back) into chemical compounds for e.g., energy storage, to bridge intermittent availability and demand. Some evidence also indicates the possibility of generating hydrogen through nanoparticle production from Lunar regolith. Hydrogen, methane, and other biofuels can also be produced from other in situ resources, such as water and inorganic carbon, photo- or lithoautotrophically (e.g., with cyanobacteria and various algae species), to generate stable energy carriers. These could be liquid compounds with high energy density, such as butanediol, as means for storage of energy, to supplement or complement chemically derived bipropellants (hydrogen/methane and oxygen). In many cases, using electricigens, hydrogenic, methanogenic, and biofuel-producing microorganisms, waste products and in situ resources can be upcycled for conversion, collection and storage of energy with a higher yield and lower energy input than traditional mechano-chemical approaches.",

Beyond the common Earth-analogue applications, plastics, particularly those with high strength and durability, play a key role in supporting human activities in space, as components of spacecraft and spacesuits. Most plastics are composed of organic polymers derived from non-renewable fossil fuels. In an environment such as space, where fossil fuels are not available, recycling and upcycling of plastics will be important to (i) obtain feedstock for manufacturing to produce new consumables, (ii) re-use and recycle resources and thus close the loop on carbon-based feedstocks, and (iii) reduce waste disposal. Microorganisms have been shown to break down microplastics into metabolisable compounds that can support growth. The process, called biodegradation, offers exciting paths towards a circular bioeconomy, and researchers at the UK Centre for Astrobiology (University of Edinburgh, UK) are exploring if these microbial processes could also be leveraged for waste recycling in space. Modern synthetic biology approaches could be used to programme microbial pathways/functions tailored to extra-terrestrial environments, and use plastics as feedstock for upcycling and produce useful molecules. Complementary to the microbial plastic biodegradation stands microbial production of plastics (e.g., bioplastics). Certain microorganisms can use a variety of feedstock, including CO2, CH4, or waste biomass, to produce bioplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoates.

This, in turn, may drive the systems’ need for fluid flow and mixing. There are multiple other aspects to consider that can also impact process efficacy, which is especially applicable in bioreactors without stirring. Namely, these refer to mass transport phenomena, both intra- and inter-phase (liquid–solid, gas–liquid, gas–solid), which are dependent upon concentration gradients, temperature, etc., and must be considered during bioreactor design.",

Further, space-based technologies are indispensable for monitoring weather and vegetation patterns (natural as well as anthropogenic), deforestation, water resources, plastic pollution, carbon emissions and climate change. More specifically, space biotechnologies listed in this work could provide powerful tools to support a number of specific SDGs, including ‘Zero Hunger’ (Goal 2), ‘Good Health and Well-Being’ (Goal 3), ‘Clean Water and Sanitation’ (Goal 6), ‘Affordable and Clean Energy’ (Goal 7), ‘Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure’ (Goal 9), ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities’ (Goal 11), ‘Responsible Consumption and Production’ (Goal 12), and ‘Climate Action’ (Goal 13). In the future, terrestrial environmental issues may be addressed by using space biotechnologies deliberately designed to enhance sustainability: systems that allow tight loop-closure and near-ideal circular operation of resources on a small scale are exemplary for application at a global scale. This kind of tangible public benefit is key not only for justifying space exploration to funding agencies and governments but for motivating scientists to invest their time and energy in space exploration at a time when multiple overlapping crises threaten the stability of our civilization and its ecological support systems.",
