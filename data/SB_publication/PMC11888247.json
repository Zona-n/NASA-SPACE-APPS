C. albicans has been shown to bloom in the GI tract of individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and can promote and increase the severity of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, the effects of C. albicans blooms on the host in the context of AUD or AUD-related phenotypes, such as ethanol preference, have been unstudied. In this work, we report a reduction in ethanol consumption and preference in mice colonized with C. albicans. C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited elevated levels of serum PGE2 and reduced ethanol preference was reversed by injection with antagonists of PGE2 receptors. Further, injection of mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference. These results show that PGE2 acting on its receptors EP1 and EP2 drives reduced ethanol preference in C. albicans-colonized mice. We also showed altered transcription of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum of C. albicans-colonized mice and more rapid acquisition of ethanol conditioned taste aversion, suggesting alterations to reinforcement or aversion learning. Finally, C. albicans-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol-induced motor coordination impairment showing significant alterations to the behavioral effects of ethanol. This study identifies a member of the fungal microbiome that alters ethanol preference and demonstrates a role for PGE2 signaling in these phenotypes.",

Further, we previously showed that C. albicans colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids, another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor.

(B,C) Groups are defined as Mock +1x EtOH: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open circles); Mock + 3x EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (open triangles); Ca + 1x EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black circles); Ca + 3x EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 and 3.5g/kg EtOH on day 4 (black triangles). (D-F) Groups are defined as Mock + SS: mock-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on days 1 and 3 (open circles); Mock + EtOH: mock-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (open triangles); Ca + SS: C. albicans-colonized, received sterile saline ip injections on day 1 and 3 (black circles); Ca + EtOH: C. albicans-colonized, received 1.5g/kg ethanol ip injected on days 1 and 3 (black triangles). (G) Groups are defined as Ca/Mock + SS + Veh, fed C. albicans (black circles) or sterile PBS (open circles), received sterile saline and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Veh, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Mock + Et + Ants, fed sterile PBS, received ethanol and antagonist injections; Ca + Et + Veh, fed C. albicans, received ethanol and vehicle injections; Ca + Et + Ants, fed C. albicans, received ethanol and antagonist injections. All injections were IP, given before habituation or testing. Ethanol injections were 1.5g/kg of mouse weight and antagonists were 2g/kg of both EP1 and EP2 antagonists. (B) time after 3.5 g/kg ethanol injection (seconds) for the mouse to lose its righting reflex (LORR onset). (C) blood ethanol concentration (mg/dL) at the time of euthanization following LORR onset. (D) distance traveled in the open field test in a ten minute trial, shown relative to the average of the sterile saline-injected (SS) mice within the same group (mock-colonized or Ca-colonized). (E) total number of foot slips and “falls” during three trials of the balance beam test. A foot slip was defined as the foot slipping beneath the balance beam and a fall was defined as falling to the underside of the beam, or, on rare occasions, a fall off the beam. (F) cumulative time required to cross the balance beam in three trials. (G) total number of slips or “falls” from the EP-antagonist experiments. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with EP1 and EP2 antagonists or vehicle daily on days 0–4 approximately one hour before each behavioral test. (B,C) Ordinary One-Way ANOVAs were completed for statistical significance. (D-G) Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVAs were completed for statistical significance. (B-G) Bars show means with the standard deviation or geometric mean with geometric standard deviation. Symbols represent individual mice. * p<0.0220; ** p<0.0055; *** p<0.0003; **** p<0.0001.",

            "text": "Candida albicans is a commensal yeast that is found in the gut of most individuals. C. albicans has been shown to contribute to alcoholic liver disease. Outside of this, the impact of intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, C. albicans, can alter mammalian ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E2. The results highlight novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.",
