Here we present an anatomical description of this structure in the adult oyster toadfish, and establish a morphological basis for interpretation of subsequent functional studies. Light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques were applied to visualize the sensory epithelium at varying levels of detail, its neural innervation and its synaptic organization. Scanning electron microscopy was used to visualize otolith mass and morphological polarization patterns of hair cells. Afferent nerve fibers were visualized following labeling with biocytin, and light microscope images were used to make three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of individual labeled afferents to identify dendritic morphology with respect to epithelial location. Transmission electron micrographs were compiled to create a serial 3-D reconstruction of a labeled afferent over a segment of its dendritic field and to examine the cell-afferent synaptic contacts. Major observations are: a well-defined striola, medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with a zonal organization of hair bundles; prominent lacinia projecting laterally; dependence of hair cell density on macular location; narrow afferent dendritic fields that follow the hair bundle polarization; synaptic specializations issued by afferents are typically directed towards a limited number of 7–13 hair cells, but larger dendritic fields in the medial extra-striola can be associated with > 20 hair cells also; and hair cell synaptic bodies can be confined to only an individual afferent or can synapse upon several afferents.",

            "text": "Vertebrates possess a highly conserved and elaborate gravito-inertial sensing system in the inner ear. This system comprises two otolith organs, the utricle and saccule, in mammals with the exception of monotremes. A third otolith organ, the lagena, is present in fishes but absent in marsupials and eutherian mammals. Comparative data link the first sensory detectors of the ear primarily to a grouping of hair cells within a simple graviceptive statocyst from which the vertebrate inner ear probably evolved. Structurally, the otolith organs consist of layers of neural and non-neural elements. Supporting cells and ciliated hair cells populate the neurosensory epithelium, the “spot” or macula; and the kino- and stereocilia of bundles extending from the apical surface of hair cells are covered with the non-neural gelatinous and fibrous otolith membrane layers. Attached to this dense filament matrix are the weight-lending otoconia (grains) or a singular otolith (stone) in fishes. The loose aggregate of the otoconial mass of sharks and rays appears to present a transition to the rigid polycrystalline otolith found in teleosts. Otoconia are biomineral crystalline deposits of calcium carbonate organized in a calcite lattice in birds and mammals; aragonite is the predominant polymorph in fishes, amphibians and reptiles.",

            "text": "The utricle lies primarily in the horizontal plane and senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation in the forward-backward and left-right directions (or any combination therein) and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. When the head rapidly moves, inertia causes the otolith mass to “lag” behind the sensory epithelium and this force is transmitted to the stereocilia bundle by way of lateral cross-links between the apex of the kinocilium and otolith membrane. For slow movement (tilt), the heavier otolith follows the force vector of gravity. Hair cells are directional mechanosensors, and the resulting bending of their hair bundles begins the transduction cascade that transforms the vector sum of the imposing accelerations into a neural code. The hair cell polarities and their coordinated distribution on the utricular epithelium ensure that all movements in the horizontal plane are adequately sensed, and the vector of stimulation by particle motion in both the horizontal and vertical planes is encoded by the range of hair cell orientations on the saccule of the toadfish.",

There it is combined with angular motion signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with sensory cues derived from the visual, proprioceptive, tactile, cognitive and visceral systems to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. This representation is called the gravito-inertial vector (see) and is an important transformation that the brain constructs to resolve the ambiguity of gravity and self-motion and thereby maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions in healthy individuals. The utricle can be adversely affected by trauma and disease and is directly implicated in space motion sickness and disorientation during space missions and readaptation upon return to Earth’s 1g.",

As noted by the vestibular epithelium of adult Opsanus is not an oddity, but is similar in both gross and fine structure to that of many other fishes except the herring. The toadfish is noted for its survivability in harsh environments, such as extended exposure to cold climate or even stasis, its longevity (>40 years), its low food demands, and this vertebrate species’ neural response to altered gravity that likely mimics that of man. Our knowledge of the consequences of long duration space on human health is inferential. We have no biological sample return of any vertebrate species exposed to deep space upon which to analyze, evaluate, model and predict the outcome of the mission. An essential goal here is to provide the framework of the inherent design of the hair cell and afferent organization schemes in this animal to serve as the morphological basis for concurrent and subsequent studies of the physiological responses of the otolith organ under normal and novel gravitational conditions.",

Individual utricular fibers were measured at the light microscopy level (40X oil magnification) in 6 fish where the AC and U nerves were clearly separate (see Fig. 1b), and their diameter averaged 5.4 ± 2.6 μm (SD; range 1.3 – 13.3 μm; n=1654). The utricle (U), with the anterior canal (AC) ampulla opening into its anterior end and the horizontal canal (HC) ampulla opening laterally (Fig. 1), and the saccule, together with the lagena as the third otolith structure located on its posterior end, make up the two main membranous compartments of the toadfish labyrinth. The utricle is essentially an elongated sac consisting of the utricular duct continuing anteriorly and widening to become the utricular recess. The posterior canal ampulla opens into the utricular duct posterior to the common crus of the vertical canals, which opens onto the upper middle surface of the utricular duct. The utricular recess is slightly concave and contains the utricular macula, with the main orientation of the macula in the plane of the horizontal canal (Fig. 2a). Since the sensory neuroepithelia are not encased in a bony labyrinth as in higher vertebrates, access to the separate nerves and epithelia is straightforward and under visual control.",

The smooth protuberance in the middle of the ventral surface of the otolith (gibbus maculae) lies above the hair cell zone of the macula (also see Fig.4a). Opposing this central portion of the otolith are two areas (shown in Fig. 2a and one is enlarged in Fig. 2b) of diverse structural organization (extremi) likely allowing greater adhesion to the utricular duct. While slight variations in otolith morphology were noted between samples (see Table 1), common characteristics predominated. The average dimension of the otolith is about 1.5 mm in length by 1 mm in width. The size of the otolith along its medial-lateral axis is about 2-fold greater than underlying sensory macula, but is only slightly greater along its anterior-posterior axis. The most uneven and irregular areas of the utricular otolith are located away from the AC and HC ampullae, and are not in close proximity to the neuroepithelium of the utricle or walls of the canal lumen. On average the otolith mass weighs ~2 mg. The elemental composition of the otolith was determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectral analysis (Fig. 3) and revealed an expected dominance by calcium (the highest calcium Ka peak, a smaller calcium Kb peak, and the very low calcium line at 0.34 KeV); traces of oxygen (O) and phosphorous (P), perhaps due to the naturally mineral form of calcium apatite – hydroxylapatite, were present. In contrast to the human otoconia atomic elements K, Na, Mg, S, and Cl, likely due to the protein nucleus in early development, were not detected. No studies were done to reveal the organic components of the otolith mass.",

            "text": "Between the otolith and the sensory epithelium is the fibrous layer comprised of an otolith membrane (OM) near the otolith mass and the gel layer (GL) beneath it closest to the apical surface of the hair cells. Because the composition of this layer, and particularly the GL in which the hair bundles penetrate, makes it vulnerable to fixation, only limited views of the layer are presented here. Patches of OM can be usually observed on the ventral surface of the otolith (Fig. 2a, c), often having a “honeycomb” appearance. In some cases the layer remained partially intact after processing. Examples are shown in Fig. 4. In panel a, the GL partially remains from the apical surface of the hair cells to below the tips of the hair bundles, exposing the topmost apex of the hair bundles; arrowheads mark the edge of the hair cell zone of the macula. The entire neuroepithelium, including the posterolateral subgroup of hair cells in the lacinium (highlighted in Fig. 5a, c), is covered by the GL. Comparing the OM attached to the otolith in Fig. 2a with the images in Fig. 4 confirms that the layer is not homogeneous in density and the GL immediately surrounding the hair bundle apex is more vulnerable to fixation. The arrowheads in Fig. 4a point toward the regions beneath the jagged ends of the otolith not covering the macula shown in Fig. 2 (asterisks in a). Rod-like protuberances (insert, white arrowheads) extend from the non-neural walls and likely help anchor the otolith to the non-neural epithelium (* in Fig. 4a) or fibrils interconnecting otoconia in mammals. Figure 4b (and expanded portion in 4c) shows in a separate fish the apical surface of the hair cells mostly bare of the GL (lowest section), or matted by the GL (center section), or partially embedded in the GL (arrowheads, uppermost section). Fig. 4d shows a top down view of the macula in another fish to illustrate exposed hair cells, hair cells partially exposed with the honeycomb matrix, and fully covered by the layering of the OM.",

The morphological polarization of the hair bundle is given by the direction of the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium and defines the hair cell’s functional polarity. As in the utricles of other species the kinocilium of opposing hair bundles face each other at reversal line in toadfish, except in the lacinium, and the red arrows show the hair bundle polarity at selected locations on the macula. In Fig. 5b a view of the macula ventrocaudal to the AC (marked by the * in a) is given to illustrate the three zones of the macula estimated by the cyan lines. Between the lateral (upper) and medial (lower) zones is the striola containing hair cells that straddle the reversal line (in yellow); here the reversal line is precisely drawn to split the hair cells with opposing hair bundle polarity. The lateral extra-striola macula is a relatively thin zone, but contains the highest density of hair cells/100μm (11.8 ± 1; n=189 in one count), whereas the medial extra-striola macula is the largest zone and its hair cell density/100μm in the same count (6.8 ± 0.2; n=106) is slightly greater to that in the least populated striola (5.5 ± 0.5; n=89); again, red arrows show the direction of the hair bundle polarity from the shortest to the kinocilium. Fig. 5c is a composite mosaic of SEM images taken in the lacinium. The reversal line (in yellow) splits the hair cells having opposing hair bundle polarization. The hair bundle polarities in the lacinia are not directed toward the reversal line as elsewhere but are orthogonal to the norm in the macula and run parallel to the reversal line; the inserts show an enlarged view of a representative hair cell in each of these opposing sections (each location is marked by a yellow box). The kinocilia of the hair bundles in the lacinia differ in length, resembling more canal hair bundles, than the shorter kinocilia found elsewhere in the utricle. The hair cells in this specialized region lie on a 45–60° slope, implying that hair cells respond more to angular roll on a steeply pitched plane of the head to right, contralateral, ear down in the rostral subdivision or to left, ipsilateral, ear down in the caudal subdivision. Further, since the anterior portion of the toadfish utricle curves dorsally and the striola crosses the mediolateral axis of the anterior macula, hair cells there should sense vertical acceleration when the head is in its normal posture. The anterior utricle of mammals also curves upward into the frontal plane of the head, but the striola is more centrally located.",

Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm thickness were used to reconstruct the partial dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is depicted in yellow, hair cell membranes are shaded in blue and green, hair cell nuclei are colored in dark blue and purple, and the hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are shown as red spheres and those with other afferent processes are shown as green spheres. The uniqueness of this experiment is the observation that a given hair cell directs, in this example, virtually all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. The afferent here exhibited dendritic varicosities, such as swellings, associated with synaptic bodies. Like elsewhere in the macula, the labeled afferent dendritic process followed a “beam” of hair cells that exclusively innervated it (8 SBs in hair cell in e; 9 SBs in hair cell in f). Eleven of the twelve reconstructed hair cells distributed their entire synaptic bodies to the labeled afferent. The sole hair cell exception is shown in h. The hair cell contained 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled (not reconstructed) afferent process.",

For even relatively short exposures of 12–16 days in a near weightlessness environment aboard the shuttle orbiters (STS-90 and −95) the vestibular nerve afferents supplying the utricle of the toadfish underwent an enormous adjustment of their response sensitivity to an adequate inertial acceleration as revealed by physiological tests using controlled translational acceleration and change in orientation with respect to gravity (tilt/roll) conducted upon return to Earth. The response sensitivity was elevated on average by a factor of 3, with some afferents showing a saturating firing rate modulation for a ±1 Hz sinusoidal translational acceleration as remarkably low as ±0.0026g or about 0.25 mm half of peak-to-peak displacement. This extraordinary hypersensitivity persisted for the first day after landing, and then returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1G. The time course of return to normal response sensitivity closely paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts following return to 1G after a comparable stay in space. It is assumed that otolith structure is arranged for optimal responses in 1G, and that exposure of the animal to weightlessness led to a rapid adaptive response of its afferent sensitivity in an effort to restore normal sensory function. These adaptive mechanisms, revealed by tracking the re-adaptation processes upon return, were not subtle but dramatic and thus make the toadfish a suitable model to explore the influence of gravity on sensory processing in a vertebrate species.",

As a result we could not jeopardize the finding prematurely by terminating the few flight animals to conduct a morphological study of the labyrinth. Because of the short durations of the space missions, we dismissed the possibility of structural changes of the otolith mass, transducer alterations, or an afferent dendritic reorganization as responsible for the functional changes in afferent sensitivity. Further, the afferents did not exhibit any unusual nonlinearities or distortion of discharge or an aberration in the tight directionality of their response. found that the number of synaptic ribbons in rat type II otolith hair cells increased 2- to 3- fold following exposure to weightlessness. Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, the more attractive interpretation of our afferent data was an increase in synaptic strength as the initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection and a deletion of the added synaptic bodies leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1G. At present the neural adaptive mechanisms have been studied experimentally for relatively short stays in an altered gravity environment. We do not have yet information on the adaptive (or maladaptive) or compensatory mechanisms of gravity sensation as a consequence of longer periods of habitation in such adverse environments, but it is reasonable to assume that structural changes in the labyrinth might occur. This present study was motivated by the possibility of a synaptic reorganization of the utricle during future long-duration space missions.",

            "text": "Among the large number of teleost species studied the utricular otolith mass shows the most structural homogeneity, as compared to the more diverse masses in the saccule and lagena, implying a highly conserved general morphology. Despite this homogeneity, there are large variations in the otolith mass among fishes, and this mass may vary over the lifetime of the animal and vary with the chemical composition of the endolymph. The use of changes in absolute gravity levels and transitions between gravity states are powerful tools to identify the mechanisms of the gravi-sensing system development and function in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease, space) conditions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness. It has been proposed that the naturally occurring asymmetry between the left and right otolith organs, compensated under normal conditions, manifests itself during the abrupt exposure to weightlessness and the extent of this asymmetry contributes to an astronaut’s individual susceptibility. Anken and coworkers have provided compelling evidence that the gravitational environment of the fish guides the growth of the otolith mass, particularly its size and asymmetry. reviewed the changes of otolith mass during the otolith development in altered gravity in mollusks and fishes as well as the growth of otoliths in fishes in normal conditions. A popular hypothesis says that regulation of growth of the single otolith in fishes, namely the test mass upon which gravity and linear acceleration act, is based on the weight of the mass. Thus, a larger-than-normal mass should be produced in a reduced-G environment and a smaller-than-normal mass would be produced in hyper-G. Such reaction of a gravi-sensing system to the change of gravity would imply the existence of a feedback mechanism. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, the experimental results so far have not led to a clear interpretation, and made more complex by the likelihood of multiple feedback loops: a local mechanism of self-regulation and specific for the initial period of development when the neural connections are not established and a feedback mechanism related to neural self-regulation and specific for later stages of growth. A change in elemental composition of the otolith mass (see Fig. 3) as result of exposure to altered gravity might support a local feedback mechanism. The selection of the experimental model organism is relevant to settle the argument. Bottom dwelling and littoral fishes possess otolith organs that are better tuned to varying accelerations and more sensitive to low accelerations than pelagic fishes that are adapted to a more limited range of accelerations.",

            "text": "A feedback mechanism controlling utricular function has the efferent vestibular system as an obvious candidate. Efferent innervation from axons of neurons originating in the brainstem of the vestibular sensory structures is a common feature in vertebrates (e.g.; Rossi, 1964). Similar to the squirrel monkey, efferent innervation is mainly a mixture of inhibition of the hair cell membrane potential and excitation of the vestibular nerve afferent discharge. recently showed in toadfish that efferent activation produced a slowly developing hyperpolarization, an increased somatic conductance, and a reduced receptor potential in semicircular canal hair cells, and these responses often outlasted the termination of the stimulus. Because of these actions, the efferent vestibular system can exert a powerful influence on the sensitivity of angular motion sensation by the semicircular canals. We made an effort in most cases during examination of synaptic connectivity at the transmission electron microscopy level to characterize in greater detail the efferent innervation of the macula. In these cases sections were relatively thick at ~180 nm to facilitate reconstruction of the dendritic processes and the tissue was subjected to avidin-biotin complex procedures to visualize the labeling. As a result, the quality of the images was not optimized to reveal the subsynaptic cisternae in the hair cells and the opposing efferent axon. In several cases thin sections of ~80–90 nm were collected to specifically focus on the efferent organization. However, we were not able to estimate the extent of the efferent innervation to the various regions of the utricle. In our recordings of utricular afferents to controlled accelerations we often found it difficult to evoke a response using efferent stimulation. Responses were readily evoked in horizontal canal afferents in the same preparation, suggesting the efferent innervation to the utricle is considerably weaker than in the canals or efferent neurons are more segregated from each other based on their projections.",

Afferent contacting hair cells in the medial extra-striola have the greatest level of branching, specializations, and complexity, and those targeting striolar hair cells have the simplest patterns, and those supplying the lateral extra-striola have an intermediate level of complexity. The dendritic organization of afferents supplying the horizontal crista in toadfish is more complex and with broader receptive fields than observed in the utricle. The complexity of the afferent’s dendritic structure was examined in another otolith organ, the saccule, of the toadfish and matched to its auditory physiological and directional response properties by. Of particular note saccular afferents were found to possess between 7–111 terminal points per afferent in comparison to considerably fewer (1–35) terminals points in their utricular counterpart in the same species. Interestingly, no correlation was found between number of terminal points and response thresholds of saccular afferents, unlike a positive correlation found in toadfish canal afferents. Although the pigeon has otolith afferents supplying calyx-only type I hair cells and dimorphic patterns contacting both type I and II hair cells, those possessing bouton-only structure to type II hair cells have vastly more elaborate and broader dendritic patterns in the utricle, the saccule, and the lagena. The synaptic specializations of afferents to the medial extra-striola exhibit contacts not only to the basal and basolateral borders of the hair cells, but also extend along the lateral wall towards the apical surface.

The results obtained using whole nerve electrical stimulation, or even pulses applied to separated bundles, are difficult to interpret in large part due to the variation in polarization of hair cells. found about three-fourths the number of recorded utricular afferents in the chinchilla displayed a regular discharge of their interspike intervals. Since the extra-striola comprises about three-fourths the total area of the macula in this species, it is reasoned that regularly discharging afferents make up a large percentage of the output from this region. Like the chinchilla, the medial extra-striola in the toadfish occupies about three-fourths the total area of the macula. Using an intracellular paradigm to evaluate the synaptic inputs to central vestibular neurons identified by their projection(s) in the squirrel monkey, found inputs arising from regular afferents predominated in vestibuloocular-collic cells and medial vestibulospinal tract neurons to the lower cervical segments, and contribute to the other projections. An attractive hypothesis is that the vestibular nerve afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target, such as the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal reflexes controlling to the upper and lower cervical and the lumbosacral reflexes, respectively. In this scheme the regular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the linear VOR and provide the prime tonic input to spinal motoneurons (vestibular tonus) to augment motor responses.",

They incorporated displacements of the gel/mesh layer boundary, the polarization vectors of the hair cells, the 3D curvature of the macula, and transfer functions of otolith afferents from to calculate the time-dependent responses along the macula, with special attention to the striola, for simulated head tilts from pitch to roll. Since the medial extra-striola region in vertebrate species comprises the largest portion of the macula, dynamic roll and static displacements of ipsilateral ear down were most prevalent and effective in the output of their model. Further, within the flat, more 2-D, regions of the macula the calculated response patterns of the two sublayers of the otolith membrane, modeled by others, adequately described the movement characteristics of the gel layer for head tilts, and thus viscous forces from the endolymph there likely play a minor role in otolith mechanics during normal head movements. In the model the local effects due to the 3-D curvature of the macula are best seen in the striola. Afferents displaying more transient, tonic-phasic response characteristics reside in this narrow region that reflect a mixture of tonic and phasic components for the initial dynamic responses that decay to a tonic state corresponding to the new head position.

In the current study, a high degree of intra-regional variability resulted in large standard deviation values for the morphological parameters studied; however, range values indicated which regions of the macula contained afferents with extreme morphological traits. The longest, most voluminous otolith afferent, with the greatest number of nodes per fiber and bouton terminals was found in the medial extra-striola macula. It remains to be determined whether or not afferents supplying the medial macula are indeed more sensitive to vestibular stimuli than the striolar region and the lateral extra-striolar macula. However, the finding presented in Fig. 10 puts a twist to the assumption that only the terminal specializations of the afferent are linked to synaptic bodies in hair cells along the dendrite’s course. Synaptic bodies were observed associated with the afferent dendrite in the absence of any specialization. Despite the fact that the labeling process degrades the tissue and collecting thin section (<90 nm in thickness) is too risky, the use of biocytin labeling of the afferent combined with the serial reconstruction of the corresponding hair cells at the transmission electron microscopic level (180 nm thick sections) allowed validation of this unexpected linkage. The synaptic bodies were present and consistent in 3 consecutive sections.

A useful description of utricle organization is based on zones of the macula, a thin strip on the outer border (lateral extra-striola), the neighboring zone in which a reversal of hair bundle polarization occurs (striola), and largest zone stretching to the medial wall of the organ. Hair cells vary in density on the macula, and the primary afferents innervating these zones, although varying widely in structural parameters such as dendritic volume and terminal specializations, show general trends in complexity of structure. It is unknown whether hair cell density or the afferent’s dendritic structure are modifiable by external forces acting on the animal as a means to regulate gain or bandwidth of response. The otolith mass continues to grow in fish, and recently a decreased calcification was observed in the freshwater zebrafish otolith mass due to exposure to hypergravity. The toadfish’s otolith mass is suitably positioned to permit non-invasive imaging over extended periods of time. A tight coupling between the hair cells and afferents is seen: afferents target subsets of hair cells and the contacted hair cell distributes all or nearly all of its synaptic bodies to one afferent. Although the experiment has yet to be performed, the hair cell-afferent organization provides an opportunity to directly match the structural complexity of the utricle and richness of response signals carried by its afferents.",

Ninety serial sections taken at 180 nm were used to reconstruct the dendritic processes and hair cell contacts of this afferent at the TEM level. Labeled afferent is yellow, hair cell membranes are blue and green, hair cell nuclei are dark blue and purple, and hair cell synaptic bodies associated with the labeled afferent are red and those with other afferent processes are green. Panel a is an anterior view and b is a posterior view of the labeled afferent and its synaptic organization with hair cells. Twelve hair cells are reconstructed. White boxes represent enlargement in D. Inserts in a and b show two views of afferent’s dendritic tree and support the findings of Figs 6–10. Similar to afferents supplying the striola this labeled afferent had a limited branching pattern and tracked along the baso-lateral surfaces of the hair cells. The synaptic bodies in the hair cells are partially obscured by cell features, and were duplicated and placed in darkened regions in panels c–h. White arrows in panels c, d, e and h point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent as a whole; the single white arrow in e points to mixture (red and green) of synaptic bodies and the synaptic body clusters (red) to the other two hair cells are copied and placed below the afferent for better visualization; the double set of white arrows in panels f and g point the highlighted synaptic bodies to the afferent separately as indicated. c: afferent is seen cupping two hair cells. d: cell on the far right appears to have only two synaptic bodies. As revealed by the mesh overlays in a and b, which show all synaptic bodies in the corresponding hair cells and the labeled afferent, two additional synaptic bodies are found in this hair cell as it drapes over the labeled afferent (white boxes). e: eight synaptic bodies can be seen in a single hair cell (far right) onto an individual afferent bouton. f: hair cell contains nine synaptic bodies, all in relation to the club-like ending of the labeled afferent. This is a common observation: the afferent follows a beam of hair cells that appear to exclusively target it. g: hair cell on left is an anterior view of the green hair cell in f, and hair cell on the right (white asterisk) is an anterior view of the green hair cell highlighted in h (asterisk). h: hair cell contains 10 synaptic bodies, 5 in contact with the labeled afferent and 5 onto a single and separate unlabeled process (not reconstructed in this figure).",
