            "text": "Gravity has remained constant during animal evolution and the neural sensory systems detecting acceleration forces have remained remarkably conserved among vertebrates. The utricular organ senses the sum of inertial force due to head translation and head tilt relative to gravitational vertical. Change in gravitational force would be expected to have profound effects on how an organism maintains equilibrium. We characterize the physiology of utricular afferents to applied accelerations in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, in normal 1 g to establish benchmarks, after 1–32-day exposures to 2.24 g (resultant) via centrifugation (hypergravity, HG), after 4- and 16-day exposures to 1.12 g (resultant), and following 1–8 days recovery to HG exposures to study re-adaptation to 1 g. Afferents were also examined during activation of efferent vestibular pathway. Centrifugation at 2.24 g included 228°/s constant angular velocity component, and thus horizontal canal afferent responses to yaw rotation were recorded as an internal control in each fish. Afferents studied after 228°/s rotation for 4 and 16 days without centripetal acceleration, called On-Center-Control, were indistinguishable from their control counterparts. Principal response to HG was an adjustment of afferent sensitivity as a function of magnitude and duration of exposure: an initial robust increase at 3–4 days followed by a significant decrease from 16 to 32 days. Initial increase observed after 4 days of HG took >4 days in 1 g to recover, and the decrease observed after 16 days of HG took >2 days to readapt to 1 g. Hair cells in striola and medial extrastriola macula regions were serially reconstructed in 3D from thin sections using transmission electron microscopy in control fish and fish exposed to 4 and 16 days of HG. Despite the highly significant differences in afferent physiology, synaptic body counts quantified in the same fish were equivalent in their inter-animal variability and averages. No clear role of the efferent pathway as a feedback mechanism regulating afferent behavior to HG was found. Transfer from 1 g to HG imparts profound effects on gravitational sensitivity of utricular afferents and the accompanying transfer from the HG back to the 1 g resembles in part (as an analog) the transfer from 1 g to the micrograms.",

Throughout the course of a species’ evolution the intensity and direction of gravity have remained constant, whereas other environmental factors, such as predation, climate, vegetation, for example, with rare exceptions have not. The highly evolved inner ear neural systems in vertebrates are keyed to operating under gravity’s continuous influence. Detections of inertial acceleration, such as linear translation during self-motion or an external perturbation, and head orientation with respect to gravity, such as tilts, start from the bilateral otolith organs. The first vertebrate ear was principally a graviceptive statocyst more commonly found in today’s aquatic invertebrates. Otolith structures contain an inertial mass of calcium carbonate that is subject to the pull of gravity and thus possesses weight. In an earlier study fish were exposed to near weightlessness in spaceflight and in this study we exposed the fish to centrifugation to enhance the gravity load and queried in a similar fashion the sensory processing characteristics of otolith afferents.",

Otolith afferents carry the transduced signal of the gravito-inertial forces in the form of modulated spacing of action potentials to the brainstem and cerebellum (see). There the otolith code combines with angular acceleration signals obtained from the semicircular canals and with information derived from the visual and somesthetic modalities to compute a central representation of the body and its parts as well as their dynamics in space. The end result is the resolution of ambiguity of gravity and self-motion to allow healthy individuals to maintain balance and equilibrium under varying conditions. Despite invariability of gravity on Earth, physiological systems are not and are adversely affected by trauma, disease, and aging, and thus central creation of the gravito-inertial vector can be disrupted leading to vertigo, disorientation, and other clinical disorders.",

The established reference of self-orientation is now completely violated by the speed at which the individual and visual world on the retina move and by rapidly changing orientation of the gravity vector with respect to the pilot, or removal of gravity vector altogether in space missions. During the first days of spaceflight, most astronauts experience symptoms of space motion sickness and disorientation linked to the otolith organs. An extraordinary hypersensitivity to applied acceleration was observed in toadfish utricle afferents after relatively short mission aboard Shuttle orbiters. The hypersensitivity presumably was the result of exposure to near weightlessness, persisted over the first day after landing, returned to within normal levels on the second day at 1 g, and closely matched the reported readaptation in astronauts after landing following a comparable stay in space.",

What initiates these mechanisms and are they compensatory to the gravity load? In addition to the sensory afferent pathways the brain in turn sends efferent signals back to the same inner ear structures. Activation of olivo-cochlear efferent neurons can attenuate afferent sensitivity and reduce its frequency selectivity or tuning to sound. In functional terms, this efferent-to-afferent feedback loop adjusts sensitivity of hearing in a frequency dependent way. Analogous to the cochlea, efferent synaptic terminals contact both vestibular hair cells and afferents, and activation of efferent synapses influences afferent sensitivity in fish, frog, turtle, bird, chinchilla, and primates. Reflex or self-generated movements often have large purposeful acceleration components, such as those occurring during predation (attack) and avoidance (escape) behaviors that would impair the computation of a movement, and importantly any novel perturbations encountered during execution of those behaviors. To enable the afferent to continuously encode motion profiles during such overt behaviors its sensitivity to acceleration is reduced, often dramatically, but it is not clear whether the prevailing gravity load is registered by the efferent system and participates in adaptive processes.",

Since toadfish possess only type II hair cells, an attractive interpretation of our earlier afferent data was an increase in synaptic strength as an initial adaptive response to restore the “lost” gravity detection, followed by a deletion of the added synaptic bodies leading to a restoration of normal sensation after a return to 1 g. Here, we manipulate the afferent responses to acceleration by applying variable exposures to hypergravity (HG) via centrifugation and directly correlate the observed afferent sensitivity with serial reconstruction of hair cell-afferent complexes in two areas of the utricular macula in the same animal.",

The dorsal surfaces of the brainstem and posterior cerebellum were exposed by removing ∼3 mm2 portion of occiput above the foramen magnum. Efferent vestibular nuclei are seen as paramedial gray areas among the transversely running internal arcuate fibers under the floor of the IVth ventricle.

Fin flaring was used as a guide for proper placement of electrode array that required the lowest shock intensity. Alert fish activate their EVS at a maximum rate of ∼100 impulses/s (ips), and efferent nerves faithfully follow a 100 Hz stimulus train applied to the nuclei.

This axis allows smooth positioning from one head angle to another with respect to the translational axis to examine afferent directional selectivity, together with applied yaw rotational stimuli. Its center of rotation passed through the center of the head and bilateral labyrinths. Yaw stage was mounted to a 2.54-cm dia shaft through roller bearing pillow blocks to a stepper motor (labeled B4) straight geared (55:1); one stepper count equals 0.00026°. This axis allowed tilt about the axis coplanar to the Earth horizontal (graphically illustrated), and provided either static positioning or dynamic stimuli at angles between pure roll and pure pitch depending on the head angle command to the yaw motor. Next, the tilt stage was attached to a base plate (labeled B5) through roll bearing pillow blocks and stepper motor mount. The base plate was attached to a thrust block brushless linear motor (not visible in Figure 1B), which was in turn mounted to a 165-cm precision linear bearing guidance system (IDC, Petaluma, CA, United States) (labeled B6); a non-contact, incremental linear encoder provided a position sensing with 10 μm accuracy and voltage proportional to instantaneous linear velocity was derived from the servo controller; this signal was integrated in Spike2 data acquisition software to obtain a derived acceleration signal. A second, slaved rail, and linear bearing gliders (labeled B7) were coupled to the thrust block to provide additional stability and lower the center of mass of the top plate. The device was secured to an optical breadboard (TMC) (labeled B8) to ensure flatness and provide isolation, and floated from the lab floor by jelly pads to absorb substrate-borne vibrations. Unit recording stability was confirmed up to 0.5 g at 12 Hz (maximum tested). A digital controller (Galil Motion Control, Rocklin, CA, United States) installed on a Windows-based platform provided command signals to each motor. Software control was based on Galil motion control libraries called from a user interface written in Igor (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, United States) scripts to permit step or continuous, dynamic motion about one or more axes at selectable parameters.",

            "text": "Test protocol was designed to provide direct comparisons of afferent responses to translation within and across the populations subjected to different HG and adaptation conditions. Secondarily, tilt stimuli were used to extend the response characteristics. The hair cell’s bundle is morphologically polarized and its receptor potential is directionally sensitive and behaves as a rectified cosine-function to bundle displacement; the functional polarization vectors of utricular afferents are distributed in a fanlike shape, as is to be expected from the hair cell orientations in the macula. Afferent directional selectivity was defined by its maximum (Smax) and minimum or null (Smin) sensitivities. To accomplish this a sinusoidal translation along a plane parallel to Earth was delivered as the fish was rotated about the yaw or z-axis and paused to collect five or more consecutive cycles. In our standard test protocol, a 1–2 Hz translational sinusoid was delivered at amplitude of ±0.02–0.05 g as the fish was stepped about the z-axis in typically successive 15° steps. Test magnitude was set to prevent as well as possible any nonlinear distortions of afferent impulse rate (IR) such as saturation in the ON-direction or “cut off” in the OFF-direction. In successful recordings, the afferent Smax and Smin to translation were captured within five to nine steps; in some cases, the Smin was not obvious (discussed later in the section “Results”). In many cases the recording was compromised before completing the required protocol and the data were discarded. In afferents with particularly stable recording conditions static and dynamic tilts were delivered, selected often at the z-axis angle that elicited its Smin and Smax responses to translations. Static tilts were typically ±1–3° displacement (12°/s2 ramp on/off) and were held to determine the time course of impulse adaptation. In some instances afferent directional selectivity was determined for both translations and tilts.",

            "text": "Data were imported off-line into a custom interactive analysis procedure written in Igor. Desired portions of record with respect to specific stimuli were manually selected and inspected using an interactive graphical analysis procedure. A stimulus trigger (positive zero-crossing) was used as a time reference to generate 100–180 bin/cycle phase histograms of stimulus and response. A discrete Fourier analysis was applied to compute the first-harmonic stimulus/response amplitude and phase. Response sensitivity (afferent output/stimulus input) was calculated by dividing IR modulation of derived 1st harmonic of modulation by acceleration amplitude, e.g., impulse rate (IR) per second (ips) per cm/s2 or g (9.81 m/s2) linear acceleration; response phase is angle between output and input peaks in ° using the lab-defined reference. A cosine function was applied to data in a method following to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). Some afferents are silenced over a portion of the stimulus cycle. In the least squares fitting procedure bins lacking data were not assigned a value of zero, and therefore the curve fit was not influenced by a truncated response. This form of response nonlinearity may lead to a misrepresentation of data because a portion of the curve fit will take negative values. When detected in real time, the stimulus was reduced in amplitude to permit a more full-cycle impulse modulation. Despite these efforts and the need to maintain comparable stimulus parameters for capturing Smax response saturation and silencing of the discharge were often unavoidable. Both the mean IR, defined as IR at half of computed peak-to-peak modulation, and the average IR, defined as number of impulses divided by stimulus cycle time, were measured. The former IR assists in detecting large truncated or clipped responses and the latter took into account the different cycle time of sinusoids used and served as a more reliable measure of IR during stimulation. Samples of IR >30 s in length (from 120 to >36,000 interspike intervals) in the absence of stimulation were taken to describe the afferent background impulse properties. Degree of regularity was evaluated by determining the non-normalized coefficient of variation (CV) of rate, defined as the standard deviation of interspike intervals divided by mean interval. An example of protocol for characterizing afferent responses in control and experimental fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3.",

Digital mosaics were made using the Olympus Soft Imaging System MegaView III digital camera at 5000× (microscopic) magnification from every seventh section and the hair cells were numbered. Mosaicked sections served as maps for locating and identifying the numbered hair cells in non-mosaic sections. Every hair cell on every section (mosaic and non-mosaic) was examined for presence of synaptic bodies and hair cell-afferent synapses. Sections were initially analyzed at 8000× magnification, and suspected synapses were enlarged to 12,500× for validation (see Figures 2A,B). Digital images of all likely synaptic bodies were taken and coded with a number for the section, hair cell, and number of synapses present. A low power image (4000×) was also taken for better cell identification on the map. Combined data were used to accept or reject probable synaptic bodies. Synapses or other structural features of interest were also photographed at this time. Images were transferred to an SGI Onyx for permanent storage and further synapse analysis. For counting, synapses were recorded on sheets of paper on which there are numbered contours of identified hair cells, with the numbers matching those on the maps. Strict criteria for counting synaptic bodies were followed. Only structures consisting of a central, electron-opaque body (presynaptic density), and a halo of vesicles were counted. Panels A and B in Figure 2 show digital images of two consecutive sections separated by section thickness of 180 nm. Arrows in each panel point to the same single SB in the hair cell. Figure 2C shows a cartoon of 2 of the 10 hair cells on either side of the reversal line in the striola as an illustration of method used in tabulating the results. Greater than 90% of synaptic bodies are single specializations along the hair cell internal wall, followed by pairs of bodies, and rarely a cluster of three or more bodies. Because of the time required to perform this task, typically 3–4 months full-time effort per macula, SB counts were done from selected fish in which extensive physiological data were first obtained. Synaptic ribbons in utricular hair cells were analyzed using the ANOVA and MANOVA features of SuperANOVATM software. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.",

A representative utricular afferent behavior in control fish to linear acceleration (panels A–C) and to tilt (panel D) is given in Figure 3. Orientation of the fish about the z-axis (Yaw Position in A) was set at 90° to provide a positive acceleration directed out the fish’s right ear along the inter-aural axis ipsilateral to the recording site. Nine consecutive cycles of sinusoidal linear acceleration (±15.7 cm/s2 or ±0.016 g) at 2 Hz were recorded (A) and averaged (B) to give a response of the following characteristics: averaged modulation was ±51.7 ips about a fitted rate of 47 ips, with a sensitivity of 3.3 ips/cm/s2 or 3234 ips/g occurring at peak phase of -134° re: acceleration. Average IR was 41 ips/cycle indicating a slight silencing of its rate in the OFF-direction. This response represented the afferent Smax. Afferent directional selectivity, a critical parameter to measure across experimental fish to precisely establish Smax, the spatio-temporal characteristics of averaged data at different head angles are plotted in Figure 3C. Cartoons of fish show the direction of +linear acceleration at five different fish orientations. Smax (Figure 3C) is the uppermost point (solid circle) on the yellow line. Rotation of fish about the z-axis from Smax at 90° head angle (Figures 3A,B) by half-circle to 270° head angle elicited a comparable and expected Smax along the inter-aural axis but with a 180° phase shift due to the lab-specific denotation. Peak of response modulation with respect to peak acceleration amplitude typically remained consistent over a hemi-field of head angles, rectified as the polarity shifted in the lab-defined coordinates, and showed variable leads to lags. Data were fit by a rectified (temporal or phase of response; black curve superposed on open circle symbols of phase re: acceleration) cosine (amplitude of modulation) function (red curve in Figure 3C superposed on solid blue circle symbols of gain data). Note the rise and fall of gain in a cosine fashion as the fish’s orientation was shifted from inter-aural accelerations to accelerations directed out the fish’s snout or tail. The afferent was tested for nearly 360° change in orientation at 21 separate head angles. The fitted nulled value of 0 for Smin (e.g., Smin/Smax = 0 in the example in Figure 3C) reflected the sharpness of directional tuning and the correspondence between tested (filled and open circles) and fitted (red and black curve) responses was sharp. Same afferent’s responses to tilt stimuli at 2 Hz, ±0.16° displacement, were recorded in a similar fashion at 23 separate orientations to determine Smax and Smin to tilt (D). Smax was 801 ips/° and nearly aligned to pure roll tilt as expected from the inter-aural responses to linear acceleration. Smin was near a complete null (32 ips/°) response predicted from the Smax to linear acceleration (yellow line) at both nose down (Pitch-N) and tail down (Pitch-T) pitch tilts, and the Smin/Smax ration was 0.04. Note the congruency between the responses to the two stimuli: Smax for linear acceleration (in C) was directed along the inter-aural axis out the right ear and Smax for tilt (in D) occurred at pure roll with right ear down. Similarly, Smin for linear acceleration occurred in forward or backward movements and Smin for tilts occurred in pure nose down or up pitches.",

Cartoons give at five positions of fish to help visualize the stimulus. Maximum response (in ips/g) was calculated at each orientation and plotted as a function of head angle (in °). A cosine function (red curve) was applied to data to determine degree of spatial tuning, directional selectivity, and response maximum (Smax) and its minimum (Smin). In this example Smax was 3234 ips/g at 90° (comparable at 270°) and afferent was highly spatially tuned (Smin/Smax = 0).

Often Smin was captured, but the recording was compromised before Smax response was reached and thus omitted from analysis. Figure 4 shows the topographical structure of the utricular macula (A) and distribution of recorded head angle at its Smax for the 162 control afferents (filled black circles) in a polar plot.

Figure 7 shows disruption of response to a 2 Hz sinusoidal linear acceleration of ±24.4 cm/s2 (or ±0.025 g) by EVS activation via a shock train applied to the brainstem (A) or self-generated by the fish itself (B). In the absence of EVS activation the afferent had an averaged response modulation of ±6.3 ips (±0.26 ips/cm/s2 or ±252 ips/g) centered about an IR of 7.2 ips that was temporarily altered by the brief epoch of EVS stimulation. When EVS action was less pronounced, afferent rate was elevated while at the same time its response modulation was decreased but not abolished. Record in Figure 8A shows instantaneous IR (unit, in ips) and raw voltage record (in mV) for 2 Hz ± 0.24° sinusoidal tilt of the fish rotated 90°, thereby delivering pure roll (±right down/left up) stimuli. EVS stimulation elevated IR 4.5-fold from 11.8 ips (B, control cycles) to 51.9 ips (C), while halving response modulation from 11.6 ips (or 63.6 ips/°; B, control cycles) to 7.4 ips (or 31.4 ips/°; C). Mean percent reduction in response sensitivity to linear acceleration in 27 tested utricular afferents was 56.7 ± 24.1 (range 18–88%; afferents in which the response was completely abolished were not included in this calculation). During a more steady state level of EVS activation after the initial onset of EVS pulses, the temporal relation of response modulation to stimulus (phase in ° with respect to peak °) was unaffected, similar to that seen in HC afferents. However, the response to acceleration over any portion of the stimulus cycle can be dramatically altered during short bursts of EVS activation, such as the records in Figures 7A,B and the two brief epochs shown in the first portion of record in Figure 8A.",

No significant difference was observed in response and IR to rotation among the recorded afferents, suggesting there was no broad, non-descript action on the periphery during the experimental tests. In conclusion, behavior of HC afferents serves as an internal control of variables associated with centrifugation, such as the duration (1–32 days) of 1.12 or 2.24 g centrifugation, length of recovery to normal gravity (1–8 days), and constant angular rotation without centripetal force (OCC) used in the present study.",

Reaction was bi-phasic starting with a significant twofold increase in Smax after 3 (N = 228 afferents) and peaked at 4 (N = 153 afferents) days of exposure (highlighted in red in Table 1), with a return to normal values after 5 (N = 148 afferents) and 8 (N = 196 afferents) days of exposure, and then followed by a significant reduction by ∼one-third after 16 (N = 245 afferents), 24 (N = 177 afferents), and 32 (N = 192 afferents) days of exposure to 2.24 g (highlighted in blue in Table 1). The Smin/Smax ratio remained the same on average for all populations within and across the wide range in experimental conditions. Interestingly, significant changes were observed in average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle; Table 1): average IR was reduced at 2D prior to the sensitivity increase at 3D, and stayed at a 20–40% lower level from 5D to 32D despite the significant changes in Smax over these periods of 2.24 g exposures. Records from the 4- and 16-day fish confirmed that the Smax of the majority of afferents, like their control counterparts, occurred at head angle associated with a positive acceleration directed out the ipsilateral labyrinth (Figure 4B, Table 1). In addition, the positive correlation of Smax and average IR (Figures 5B,C) was maintained after exposures to HG, even with a significant reduction in both Smax and average IR recorded in the 16-day fish (Table 1). Correlations within each group between MIR (ips) and CV and, in turn, Smax were also maintained at the same level of confidence. Data obtained in recovery periods to 1 g from 1 to 8 days after HG indicated that average IR set point was restored after 2 days in normal gravity. It is important to note that HC afferents recorded in each experimental group not only were unaffected in terms of response modulation to yaw rotation as mentioned above, but also had an average IR (41 ± 21 ips/cycle) equal to that of utricular control afferents (40 ± 19 ips/cycle) that remained consistent under all experimental conditions (right two columns of Table 1).",

Here, afferent response to EVS activation was noticeably infrequent with only 11.2% responding (against 37.2% in control afferents), and noticeably weaker with a difference of EVS to non-EVS epochs or IR (ΔEVS) significantly less (6.9 ± 14.9 ips) than that for control afferents (25.7 ± 17.6 ips). These findings at the 32-day mark are not consistent with the significant Smax reduction (Table 1). In the same vein, the afferent response to EVS pulses after 4 days at 2.24 g (4D 2.24 g) was more prevalent with 62.3% responding with significantly greater ΔEVS (43.8 ± 38.1 ips) than that for control afferents. These findings suggest that EVS action was greatly enhanced at 4-day mark, but again the action is not consistent with the significant Smax increase (Table 1). At the present stage it is not possible to establish direct causality of afferent IR and response behavior after HG exposures and EVS action.",

Importantly, highly significant differences in response sensitivity were found in the same fish from which SB counts were taken. In Figure 11A, Smax was significantly higher (p < 0.0001, ANOVA) in 4-day (4945 ± 2823 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 93) and significantly lower (p < 0.002, ANOVA) in 16-day (1245 ± 1097 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 89) fish from controls (2045 ± 1314 SD imp/s/g; two fish; n = 39). In Figure 11B, the average IR at Smax (in ips/cycle) also differed: rate was significantly lower (p < 0.01, ANOVA) in 16-day (28 ± 15 SD ips/cycle), and higher, but not significantly so, in 4-day (46 ± 21 SD ips/cycle) fish from control afferents (39 ± 24 SD ips/cycle). Figure 11C gives the results of hair cell SB counts in the same fish from which afferent responses were obtained (Figures 11A,B). Number of SB per 100 μm2 was determined for two macular regions, one straddling the reversal line in the striola (shaded columns) and the other 150 μm away in the medial extrastriola (solid columns), in controls (black) and fish exposed to 2.24 g for 4 (red) or 16 (blue) days. On average SB count per hair cell was 4–7 in the two macular regions in each experimental group, and ranged in number from 1 to 13 (n = 223) in control medial extrastriola, 1 to 25 (n = 505) in control striola, 1 to 20 (n = 520) in 4-day medial extrastriola, 1 to 22 (n = 484) in 4-day striola, 1 to 16 (n = 253) in 16-day medial extrastriola, and 1 to 20 (n = 575) in 16-day striola regions. Variability within each group was large and thus, despite the high number of hair cells completely reconstructed in three dimensions, single and multiple SB densities in the two macular regions were not significantly different between control and HG fish. This is in stark contrast to the clear separation in afferent physiology.",

Afferent dendritic organization to the type of hair cell (type I and/or type II) it supplies varies in complexity (see review by), and it is reasonable to assume that hair cell excitation is not uniform. In chinchilla utricle about three-fourths of recorded afferents displayed a more regular discharge of their interspike intervals, and corresponds to about three-fourths the total area of macula designated as the medial extrastriola. Toadfish utricle is structurally similar in the broad sense to other species, including amniotes and other anamniotes, and its hair cell polarization is highly organized across the more 2D macula surface. Like the chinchilla, toadfish medial extrastriola occupies about three-fourths the total macula area (Figure 4A) and reflects the responses of the majority of afferents recorded in this study (Figure 4B). Unlike the chinchilla, regularity of discharge of toadfish utricular afferents span a continuum but three-fourths of them are more irregularly discharging. An attractive hypothesis is that vestibular afferent inputs are matched to the dynamic requirements of the various reflexes they target, and evolutionary pressures drive the particular behaviors. In this scheme, the prevalent irregular utricular afferents are best matched to the control requirements of the rapid attack and escape avoidance of toadfish.",

The adaptive mechanisms to altered gravity might be confined to the peripheral sensory structures or involve central processing centers or likely require the participation of both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Within the first day after STS-90 and -95 shuttle landings, a response hypersensitivity to acceleration stimuli was observed in utricular afferents (Figure 9A). Reduced gravity in orbit during these relatively short microgram exposures apparently resulted in an upregulation of afferent sensitivity. Time course of return to normal sensitivity in toadfish afferents paralleled the reported decrease in vestibular disorientation in astronauts after return from shuttle missions. Although belonging to a distinct group of animals, recordings taken directly from gravitoreceptors of the land snail (phylum Mollusca), and thus no intervening synapse as in afferent recordings, after exposures of 12–16 and 30 days in space also showed a pronounced response hypersensitivity to tilt. In a complimentary study in tilapia the gain of an otolith-related vestibuloocular reflex was significantly increased within the first postflight week, and returned to control levels in the second postflight week, of space missions.",

It was followed by a period of normalcy and then the development of the anticipated hyposensitivity after 16–32 days of HG. Initial hypersensitivity was robust and recovered to normal levels after ∼4–6 days at 1 g. Utricular afferent response to HG did not reflect a systemic action on the labyrinth as a whole, since HC afferents were consistently normal in response and discharge properties and remained independent of level and duration of HG in the same fish. OCCs performed at 4- or 16-day exposure to 228°/s (38 rpm as in 2.24 g runs) constant angular velocity were identical in all measures to their utricular and canal afferent counterparts in non-rotated controls. Video taken during the light cycle did not reveal any aberrant behavior during the different exposures of 2.24 g, perhaps suggesting a central compensatory mechanism in operation. Of prime importance is the fact that in the same species we have the neural response to microgram and a more comprehensive evaluation of the neural response to HG.

In the Russian Cosmos/Bion missions many of the effects observed early in flight on vestibular and oculomotor function in nonhuman primates are consistent with response hypersensitivity. Badakva and Kozlovskaya summarized their results in. Within the first days in orbit gaze shifts to lateral visual targets were hypermetric, despite a reduction in head displacement. This hypermetria caused positional errors and was compensated by an increase in gain of the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) to 1.5 on Day 2 and remained high (2.0) up to Day 8. Associated with gaze hypermetria, response of vestibular nuclei neurons during gaze fixation task gradually increased to a maximum on Day 4, like our present HG data, and returned back to normal for the rest of the 1–2 week flight. Gualierotti and colleagues directly addressed otolith afferent discharge in μG in technically challenging experiments in the bullfrog. Although the interpretation of their data is difficult, otolith afferent discharge appeared to increase within the first 3 days of the orbital mission and returned to normal at Day 5. Interestingly, this closes matches our HG data after exposure to 2.24 g. The initial reaction in astronauts and animals points to a possible common mechanism. Although it is clearly a speculation, the evidence suggests an exaggerated otolith reaction is evoked to a novel gravity challenge. This challenge occurs in either direction from a loss of gravity in spaceflight to an applied force by centrifugation on the ground. To what extent is this simply a transitory maladaptation or a behaviorally relevant response remains to be determined. Unfortunately, critical data in real-time targeting this initial response to microgram and HG remain lacking.",

As bone is adversely remodeled during space missions, calcium carbonate on the other hand might be deposited on existing otoconia to provide greater “weight” in an effort to restore the “gain” of gravity sensation; conversely, HG would lead to an ablation of otoconia mass to “rebalance” function. Our afferent recordings did not reveal any aberration(s) in discharge properties or spurious excitations except a change in response sensitivity, implying that if such a mechanism was in operation, the remodeling of the otolith mass was uniformly distributed.

The findings of promoted this hypothesis: number of ribbon synapses in certain type II hair cells in rat was labile, increasing by approximately 55% following exposure to microgram; type I hair cells were less affected. Toadfish vestibular epithelia possess only type II hair cells and lack the specialized nerve calyx seen in reptiles, birds, and mammals. Also in toadfish the number of en passant and terminal boutons of a given semicircular canal afferent, indicating a potential locus for synaptic coupling to a hair cell, are positively correlated with its response sensitivity. Thus, an increase in ribbon synapses in rat utricular hair cells by microgram exposure aligns with our observed post-flight hypersensitivity in toadfish utricular afferents. However, more recent evidence by in mouse exposed to 15 days of microgram paints a different picture. They found synapse densities decreased, not increased as seen by Ross, in medial extrastriola hair cells and remained unchanged elsewhere in other macula regions and HC cristae. Although one species is likely more susceptible to gravity influences than another based on body mass, this discrepancy between rat and mouse is intriguing but not readily apparent, and must be resolved in future studies. As we discuss below, the picture is even more blurred when we make a direct comparison between recorded response sensitivity and 3D serial reconstruction of synaptic bodies in individual hair cells in the same animal.",

            "text": "An important piece of relevant evidence is the time of synapse formation and reformation in inner ear structures. Turnover rate of ribbon synapses in vestibular hair cells is unknown, but some estimates derived from other systems are useful. Ribbon synapses in the visual system of albino rat are said to have a life span of ∼8 h and are structurally plastic particularly in assembly and disassembly processes during development. In the hippocampus, asymmetric synapses form and disappear within a few minutes. Although related to different systems, these data indicate that specific times of synapse formation are from minutes to hours. Further, showed that synapses not only turn over but that the rate of turnover increases during development, suggesting that both synapse formation and termination rates are regulated and that the specificity of synaptic connections can be increased by selective termination of synapses. Thus, as sensitivity is decreased to compensate for hyperstimulation, excess synapses will be deactivated by receptor downregulation and “anchors” inside the cell mark the former receptor sites. Since the sudden change of gravity is an extreme condition, the specific time of synapse rearrangement might be expected to be longer: from hours to several days.",

In the same fish we recorded a substantial afferent population to acceleration in control fish and in fish after 4- or 16-day of 2.24 g exposures, and conducted complete 3D ultrastructural reconstructions of hair cells in the reversal zone of striola and in the predominant medial extrastriola region. Afferents had highly significant differences in Smax (Figure 11A) and average IR per cycle (Figure 11B) with virtually little to no overlap. Even with this clear distinction in utricular physiology, SB counts per hair cell were statistically equivalent in the selected three afferent populations in both macular regions measured in the same fish: hair cells contained on average five to six synaptic bodies, but the variation in number was large (Figure 11C). Afferent Smax also showed a wide variation from less sensitive to highly sensitive within an individual animal, but were distinctly separated as a group from the other populations. The importance of this finding is that the physiological and anatomical results were obtained in the same animal, and no direct correlation was found. It might be argued that the utricular synaptic organization had adapted over the course of afferent recordings. We saw no indication of this: afferents after 4 and 16 days of HG were hyper- and hypo-sensitivity, respectively, from the start to the finish of the recordings and require days to readapt to 1 g. Clearly other factors might be in play. For example, adjustment of synaptic efficacy or strength might involve many processes other than the SB itself, such as Hebbian plasticity based on the correlation of pre- and post-synaptic cells. have provided some key insights into synaptic plasticity in mechanosensory hair cells. Using transgenic and mutant zebrafish lines they found that innervation was crucial for regulating the number, size, and localization of ribbons in maturing lateral line hair cells, and for their maintenance at the mature synapse. How synaptic weights and innervation patterns might scale up or down or fluctuate in distribution within the hair cell–afferent complexes need to be examined in our model.",

It is remarkable that vertebrates exert an efferent (EVS) neural control over the sensitivity, bandwidth, and linearity of sound and motion sensation. In general, the EVS provides hair cell organs not only with the means to control passive filtering of sound and motion signals, but also to regulate the mechanical gain of the living amplifiers in the ear. Efferent cell bodies are located in the caudal brainstem, a phylogenetically ancient structure that monitors and controls vital functions including alertness and arousal. A typical efferent neuron in toadfish has extensive dendritic arbors spanning the brainstem, thereby providing the neuron the capability to receive a wealth of descending command and ascending sensory information (; confirmed in the present study, q.v. Supplementary Figure 3). Spatial coding is likely not selective, since efferent fibers can innervate multiple end organs on one side or even bifurcate within the brain to innervate both labyrinths.",

We addressed this question indirectly in this study by (1) inferring EVS action on the hair cell by comparing Smax observed in each experimental group (Table 1), (2) inferring EVS action on the afferent by comparing average IR at Smax (IR, in ips/cycle) observed in each experimental group (Table 1), and (3) pairing the MIR (in ips) with and without EVS stimulation in absence of acceleration in the same afferent in each experimental group (Table 2). A more direct measure to determine EVS role in neural adaptation was sought, but not found. For example, axons presumed to originate from efferent neurons were too infrequently encountered and their discharge had no clear variants to permit a meaningful comparison among subjects within or across groups, and the EVS action on afferent sensitivity to acceleration stimuli via its influence on hair cell receptor potential could not be normalized in any meaningful manner, mostly due to the variability in EVS efficacy and frequency of occurrence within each fish.",

In toadfish these actions are preceded by a stereotypic behavior, and it is powerfully evoked during the anticipatory phase of production of large, self-generated, and behaviorally relevant movements. EVS regulation of afferent sensitivity is likely through its action on hair cell modulation. A novel finding supporting the importance of behavioral context in EVS function was recently reported by. In a semi-isolated preparation, which permits identifying the source of incoming signals, of larval Xenopus it was shown corollary discharge signals arising from the spinal central pattern generator cyclically modulated efferent neurons during fictive swimming. During these phasic epochs of efferent signaling, there was a corresponding gain reduction of afferent responses to vestibular-related stimuli. Thus, similar to toadfish, the EVS of Xenopus can effectively optimize sensory processing.",

Given their low discharge at rest and disregard to benign vestibular stimulation, as well as the powerful excitation during preparatory behaviors, efferent neurons likely provide more episodic control over their synaptic targets and not a tonic influence. Recent evidence showed that the EVS could influence VOR plasticity using the α9 knockout mouse model, particularly after destruction of one labyrinth. Although in a classical sense the EVS might still provide an underlying tonic drive to its targets, for the sake of argument in the present context a drive that also monitors the prevailing gravity condition, it does not provide cross-talk between otoliths and canals for continuous passive stimuli or influence the output during benign and nonthreatening volitional movements. Viewed from this perspective the EVS endows the toadfish with a powerful means to adjust the sensitivity and dynamic range of motion sensation, and is positioned to monitor prevailing conditions and regulate the gravity sensation. However, no direct measurements or indirect inferences from afferent discharge behavior were found here to suggest a clear EVS role in regulating the utricular response to altered gravity. The information content provided by the efferent feedback signal in diverse conditions may be more complex and involve a novel self-regulation of synapses induced by changes in input signals in altered gravity.",
