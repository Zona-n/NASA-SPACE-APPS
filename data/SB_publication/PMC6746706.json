The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/−4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.",

This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth.

This redistribution shifts fluid upward from the lower parts of the body. An increased intracranial pressure caused by this fluid shift has been attributed as a major cause of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS). 40% of astronauts have experienced SANS, including the spaceflight subject of the NASA twins study. The physiological impact of SANS encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening (GF), choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots). While the physiological characteristics of SANS are well documented, the mechanisms that drive SANS are still poorly understood.",

A previous study from our group characterized the effects of a 13-day exposure to the space environment aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) in mice. This study found that spaceflight conditions induced oxidative damage that resulted in mitochondrial apoptosis in the mouse retina. Subsequent work with low-dose proton radiation and a simulated microgravity mice model showed a major role of simulated space radiation in the increase of oxidative stress, with synergistic effects when simulated microgravity was applied. In our current study, mice were exposed to the space environment for 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed to spaceflight.",

Pde8a is a member of the phosphodiesterase family. Phosphodiesterase specific member inhibition has been previously shown to attenuates oxidative stress in diverse tissues. Hif1a was shown to protect against oxidative stress directly at the mitochondria, but the effects of this gene were shown to be highly contextual in the presence of reactive oxygen species. Hgf activates an antioxidant signaling pathway that culminates in increased levels of nitric oxide and the activity of antioxidant enzymes regulated by this molecule. Taken together, the upregulation of Pde8a and the downregulation of the Hif1a and Hgf are linked to the development of increased oxidative stress in the retina.",

Mutations in the gene Rho, which creates a protein that composes rod photoreceptors and is essential for vision in low-light conditions, can alter its splice isoforms. These alternate isoforms lead to the construction of abnormal RHO proteins and trigger the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, proper alternative splicing of Nxnl1 from rod photoreceptors and other ocular cell types has been associated with cone photoreceptor maintenance. Disruption of these splice isoforms can reduce the density of cone photoreceptors and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina. Overall, our results indicate that the space environment might create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, in addition to the altered gene expression profile reported. Future studies should address which genes are alternatively spliced to understand potential changes in protein structure and find further associations with retinal diseases. Furthermore, mouse models for retinitis pigmentosa are available. Determining which mouse model is most similar to mice exposed to the space environment will help determine the appropriate model to perform Earth-analog experiments. Finding an appropriate Earth-based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight.",

Although eight of the DETFs are known for their importance for the retinal development and maintenance in Earth conditions, 21 of the DETFs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. From the DETF overrepresentation analysis, transcription factors were identified that are known to influence chromatin architecture. Changes in chromatin architecture indicate that the cause for changes in retinal structure observed during spaceflight is more complex than solely alterations in RNA processing. The overrepresentation analysis showed enrichment of transcriptional regulators for H3K9 demethylation, which is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin. Demethylation of H3K9 can result in the unraveling of this heterochromatin, which can then influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome. This can further drive changes in gene expression and either create abnormal and potentially harmful cellular behavior or act as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate damage the retinal tissue has experienced from spaceflight. The connections between chromatin reorganization as a disease-causing or disease-mitigating mechanism during spaceflight has not yet been explored. Determining the locations of chromatin reorganization could provide insight to these questions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets.",

Our immunostaining for marker 4-HNE showed evidence of oxidative stress within the retina. Evidence of a response to this oxidative stress was also observed in the gene expression data. The gene Bnip3 was differentially expressed, showing upregulation during spaceflight (adjusted p-value: 2.94E-03; log2 fold-change: 0.309). Bnip3 is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell. Misfolded proteins can occur as a result of oxidative stress. Also upregulated in the spaceflight data are heat shock genes Hsp90aa1, Hsp90b1, and Hspa4l which can assist correct protein folding and are known to protect against oxidative stress. From this, we see evidence of a potential compensatory mechanism becoming activated in spaceflight in order to correct and mitigate cellular damage accumulating in retinal tissue. One consideration for long duration space missions are the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the space environment. For long duration missions, it becomes imperative to evaluate for how long these compensatory mechanisms can be sustained and how to extend or amplify its beneficial effects. Additionally, the nearest Earth-analog disease that we identified, retinitis pigmentosa, has known links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage.",

The circadian rhythm regulates behavioral and physiological processes over a 24-hour period, principally controlled by day/night patterns. Disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to irregular sleep patterns, mood, and metabolism function, as well as the development of cancer. The differentially expressed gene with the smallest adjusted p-value, Drd4 (adjusted p-value: 4.31E-51; log2 fold-change: 0.812), is a dopamine receptor that has been associated with the circadian rhythm. Specifically, Drd4 downregulates the gene Adcy1, which was also found to be differentially expressed in this study (adjusted p-value: 1.45E-09; log2 fold-change: −0.427). Adcy1 produces cyclic AMP, a signalling mechanism in numerous retinal functions, such as retinomotor movements, disc shedding, certain types of retinal degeneration, and apoptosis of photoreceptors. Circadian rhythm genes are of special interest in the space environment, where day/night light signals are irregular. For example, astronauts aboard the ISS will experience up to 16 sunsets and sunrises a day. However, the mice in our experiment were in constant 12-h light/dark cycle, which leads us to believe that events other than the light/dark cycle itself are driving the changes in the circadian rhythm.",

Future studies should investigate the long-term impact of observed structural changes of the retina and retinal photoreceptors function that may lead to late retinal degeneration. Additional studies are needed to determine which aspects of spaceflight are responsible for photoreceptor damage and oxidative stress. Leading causes include radiation and possible alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) or intraocular pressure (IOP) induced by microgravity. It is possible that both space radiation and microgravity work in conjunction with one another to cause a more severe pathological result than either would in isolation. Other factors that may be driving differential gene expression include increased stress an organism experiences due to the physiological pressures of spacecraft takeoff and landing and the psychological pressures of spaceflight. The body size of an organism also impacts the amount of interstitial fluid per gram of body weight, which could impact the magnitude of fluctuating pressures influencing the retina.

Bar harbor, ME) were flown for NASA’s ninth Rodent Research experiment (RR-9). The mice lived in NASA’s Rodent Habitats (RH) aboard ISS for 35 days before returning to Earth via SpaceX’s Dragon capsule. All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. GC mice were placed into the same housing hardware used in flight, and environmental parameters such as temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels were matched as closely as possible based on telemetry data. GC mice were fed the same special NASA food bar diet as the space flown mice. All mice received the same ad libitum access to food and water. The study followed the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Loma Linda University (LLU) and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).",
