            "text": "For decades, scientists have relied on animals to understand the risks and consequences of space travel. Animals remain key to study the physiological alterations during spaceflight and provide crucial information about microgravity-induced changes. While spaceflights may appear common, they remain costly and, coupled with limited cargo areas, do not allow for large sample sizes onboard. In 1979, a model of hindlimb unloading (HU) was successfully created to mimic microgravity and has been used extensively since its creation. Four decades later, the first model of mouse partial weight-bearing (PWB) was developed, aiming at mimicking partial gravity environments. Return to the Lunar surface for astronauts is now imminent and prompted the need for an animal model closer to human physiology; hence in 2018, our laboratory created a new model of PWB for adult rats. In this review, we will focus on the rat model of PWB, from its conception to the current state of knowledge. Additionally, we will address how this new model, used in conjunction with HU, will help implement new paradigms allowing scientists to anticipate the physiological alterations and needs of astronauts. Finally, we will discuss the outstanding questions and future perspectives in space research and propose potential solutions using the rat PWB model.",

Data gathered from astronauts onboard the Soyuz, space shuttles or Mir missions and the International Space Station (ISS) have been crucial for understanding the consequences of microgravity in space, and upon return on Earth. Decades of research have established dramatic physiological changes as result of exposure to microgravity to spaceflight, including: reduced muscular mass and strength, reduced bone mineral density, cardiovascular complications, as well as others. Upon returning to Earth, these adaptations can dramatically influence astronaut health and quality of life. Therefore, ground-based models are necessary to understand the full scope of microgravity-induced pathologies as well as interventions to mitigate these while in space.",

Rodents have long been the preferred preclinical model for biomedical research both in space and on Earth, and in 1979, Morey described the first model of rat hindlimb unloading (HU), which is now the gold-standard to explore the physiological response to mechanical unloading, an analog model of microgravity. While decades of research into unloading-induced alterations to physiological systems have provided invaluable data on microgravity-induced aberrations to physiology, the standard HU model does not account for the variations of gravity inherent to different astronomical settings, such as the Moon or Mars.",

These missions will set the stage for a lunar base and serve as a stepping-stone for an eventual crewed-exploration to Mars. Therefore, to thoroughly prepare for this endeavor, there is an urge to study gravity as a continuum, and develop models mimicking partial gravity environments. The first attempt at simulating partial gravity on earth was attempted in 2010, with Moon (0.16g) or Mars (0.38g) gravitational loads in female mice. However, inbred mice may be too homogenous to have the desired transferability to human physiology in different gravitational environments. Recently, this model has been adapted to outbred rats in order to better understand the individual variations in response to partial reductions in mechanical loading. Therefore the purpose of this review is to summarize the methodology and utility of this rat partial weight bearing (PWB) model in relation to human physiology, summarize what is currently known on the musculoskeletal effects of partial gravity environments, and provide future directions for the use of this model as it relates to spaceflight and physiology.",

Ten-week-old nulliparous female BALB/cByJ mice were exposed to 21 days of Mars-analog loading, (38% of normal loading), and compared to jacketed controls (full weight-bearing). This study showed that PWB led to ~20% lower gastrocnemius wet mass and ~24% lower femoral bone volume, and was the first study to demonstrate functional alterations in muscle force production in simulated partial gravity environments. In a later study using female C57Bl/6J mice exposed to various degrees of mechanical unloading, the authors confirmed their previous observations and demonstrated that reductions in weight-bearing led to a dose-dependent atrophy of the hindlimb muscles and a decline in bone mineral density (BMD). Since then, this murine model has been used in several ground-based studies to investigate the effects of PWB on blood cell count, bone loss mechanisms, and in conjunction with low-dose high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation.",

Until recently, PWB was exclusively used on female inbred mice. However, rats demonstrated to provide potentially more accurate information regarding human physiology. Studies are often carried on outbred strains to better account for the genetic diversity observed in humans, and these animals share many physiological and cognitive characteristics with humans. Moreover, rats are smart, trainable, and social animals that process drugs similarly to humans. Additionally, their size, approximately twenty times greater for an adult rat compared to a mouse, allows for easier surgical procedures and thorough histopathological analyses. However, this change of scale for the PWB model required technical adjustments that were crucial in order to successfully adapt it for rats. These areas include addressing the housing environment, changing the suspension apparatus, and developing a pelvic harness.",

To avoid waste accumulation, we chose to use a 12” × 12” flexible perforated polypropylene floor panel layered with absorbent paper. This alternative was preferred over wire-floors, which have been shown to promote foot lesions and induce thermal stress in rats. While this type of flooring did not prevent food waste from falling onto the floor, a food chute was installed at the exterior of the cage that allowed only one pellet to be dispensed at the time, thus reducing waste and preventing any opportunities for the rats to reload themselves via the food pellets.

While rats have enough floor space in the cages according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines, their larger size allows them to freely move around and explore their environment, even when partially unloaded; therefore, suspension apparatus was secured at the center of the aluminum rod. In essence, the suspension design differed slightly from the one previously used in mice, retaining a triangle-shape structure linking the forelimb jacket and hindlimb suspension device with a back-rod, improving stabilization. A swivel clasp was added on both ends of the stainless-steel chain to provide full mobility to the animals, allowing them to move around without risking entangling the chains and modifying their partial unloading level. The most critical part of the suspension apparatus underwent major alterations to accommodate rats and improve PWB stability. In mice, a bead chain was positioned by twisting the coils of a spring with known characteristics, allowing animals to gain kinetic energy and increase mobility. This system was not an ideal fit for rats and was replaced by a key-chain ring attached to a swivel clasp directly connected to the stainless-steel chain. This design did not allow for additional kinetic energy, or variations in chain length, henceforth greatly reducing daily variations and the need to do adjustments throughout the experiments.",

While the HU model and the technical aspects of tail-suspension are beyond the scope of this article, excellent reviews have been published elsewhere. In the rat PWB system, we chose to adapt a pelvic harness to support the hind limbs, in lieu of the traditional tail suspension (described thereafter as HLS) (Figure 3). This pelvic suspension was first described by others in rats undergoing HU and has been shown to result in similar alterations regarding body weight, muscle atrophy, bone loss and glucose homeostasis compared to tail-suspended animals, while reducing lordosis and spine curvature. The pelvic harness was extremely well tolerated in all of our studies involving either PWB or HLS, and allowed animals to be maintained in the same environment while reducing the time needed to transition from one mechanical loading level to another.",

Using stainless-steel chains, we demonstrated that during a month-long experiment conducted on 149 rats, coefficients of variations did not exceed 1.8% regardless of the targeted partial unloading level. This represented a marked improvement compared to the initial mouse model. Indeed, whereas the first mouse model design (based on a spring) succeeded to remain within a 5% error margin of the desired unloading level only 77% of the time over a 21-day experiment, the rat suspension design (based on a chain) was extremely reliable and allowed for the animals to remain within ± 5% of the desired unloading levels 100% of the time during 28-day periods.",

Calf circumference was used as a weekly indirect indicator of the triceps surae (i.e., soleus and gastrocnemius) size.

Additionally, we showed that rear paw grip force either failed to increase or displayed a net decrease after exposure to all levels of PWB, with a linear relationship between gravitational load and muscle impairments. These force measurements obtained voluntarily were further confirmed by applying a tetanic nerve stimulation and recording the maximum torque of the foot during either plantar or dorsi-flexion.

In humans and rats, the soleus, a postural muscle is mostly comprised of fibers expressing the type 1 myosin heavy chain (MyHC1), which generally act as slow-twitch oxidative fibers providing endurance. During disuse and total mechanical unloading, soleus myofibers have been reported to switch from type 1 to type 2 (i.e., generally fast-twitch glycolytic), comparatively more prone to fatigue. We also see this modification in soleus composition of rats undergoing reduced mechanical loading for up to 28 days, with 40% of gravitational loading having ~6–7% shift in Type I fiber percentage (Supplementary Tables). However, we must acknowledge that up to this point we have only investigated MHCI fibers and not the separate isoforms of type II MHC fibers, which may have different functional implications. As such, future works will be necessary to investigate the nuances of different MHC isoforms and PWB.

However, animal models are traditionally developed in quadrupedal rodents. Henceforth, one of the advantages of using the PWB model instead of the traditional HLS is the possibility of investigating both the fore- and hind- limbs muscle in response to partial mechanical unloading. Recently, we used the rat PWB model to investigate if exposure to PWB20, PWB40, or PWB70 for 28 days led to a significant muscle deconditioning in the forelimbs compared to fully-loaded animals (PWB100). While we previously have shown that front paw grip force is impacted by partial mechanical unloading, we established for the first time that the biceps brachii displayed a 26% reduction in mass during partial unloading, regardless of the level. However, in the triceps brachii, we showed that atrophy was linearly correlated to the level of PWB, with reductions ranging from 9% to 17% compared to the controls. Histomorphometric analysis yielded similar results with a dose-dependent reduction in myofiber CSA. This quadrupedal modeling of partial gravity may allow for a more thorough investigation on the impacts of partial and microgravity on non-weight bearing tissues, as recent works have suggested that non-weight bearing bones can be impacted by spaceflight months after returning to Earth.",

Using the mouse PWB model, studies have shown that 21 days of exposure leads to a significant decline in body and hindlimb BMD and tibial trabecular bone volume, that was linearly correlated to the degree of unloading. Moreover, it has been shown that even PWB70 did not prevent the emergence of skeletal alterations. Similarly, in rats, we demonstrated that 2 weeks of PWB led to a dose-dependent and linear decrease in tibial BMD (Figure 4B). Further studies were conducted to establish the longitudinal time-course of skeletal impairments during partial mechanical loading and established the existence of a potential threshold for the preservation of the skeletal system. While trabecular BMD declines within 7 days of exposure to PWB, it further decreases over a month-long experiment, regardless of the PWB level, suggesting that a plateau was not reached. These results obtained in vivo were further validated by the ex vivo analysis of the distal femoral area via microcomputed tomography. Indeed, our results highlighted a dose-dependent decrease in bone volume, BMD, and trabecular number. Quantitative histomorphometry using calcein staining emphasized that weakening of the trabecular bone architecture during partial mechanical unloading was partly due to decreased osteoblast surface area and activity while osteoclasts remained similar compared to controls. These findings are in agreement with prior research utilizing the HU model and provide further validation for this model.",

Many studies have been conducted in the HU model, taking advantage of the 30 degree head-down-tilt designed to induce a cephalic fluid shift. Some of these HU models found hypovolemia, altered nitric oxide signaling, and altered sympathetic neurological activity, which may contribute to cardiovascular complications during spaceflight. However there remains controversy on how each of these mechanisms contribute to cardiovascular complications. As the rat PWB is designed to allow quadrupedal unloading, it is not associated with a fluid shift. However, until recently, the impact of partial mechanical unloading on the cardiovascular system including the effects of the pelvic harness in lieu of the tail suspension, had not been addressed. Therefore, we longitudinally monitored tail blood pressure, foot oximetry, and heart rate for 28 days in all conditions. Our results highlighted that the use of a pelvic harness during normal loading did not impair indirect measures of blood flow nor did it modify blood pressure and heart rate over the course of the experiment. This study further demonstrated that partial reductions in mechanical loading did not reveal significant changes in these parameters. While these results are preliminary, they may suggest cardiovascular protections may be conferred with minimal gravitational force, such as those found on extra-terrestrial targets such as the Moon or Mars with 1/6th and 1/3rd of the Earth’s gravitational pull. However, more works using PWB are necessary to understand the nuanced cardiovascular mechanisms that may contribute to potential protection from spaceflight-induced orthostatic intolerance.",

However, on day 14, females exposed at PWB40 displayed a significant decrease of rear paw grip force compared to their baseline, which was associated with a significant atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle. Surprisingly, the soleus did not exhibit significantly smaller wet mass compared to the controls at day 14; though there was significant atrophy of the type I myofibers. Regardless, these preliminary works may suggest differential responses to PWB in males and females and warrants further direct investigation.",

            "text": "To date, only one countermeasure has been tested using the rat PWB model. Indeed, we recently assessed the benefits of a moderate daily dose of resveratrol in male rats exposed to partial mechanical unloading at 40% of their normal weight-bearing (PWB40, Martian gravity analog). Resveratrol (or trans-resveratrol, RSV) is a polyphenol commonly found in the diet, more specifically in grape skin, blueberries, and peanuts. RSV has been studied in both animals and humans, and is associated with a wide range of biological effects and cellular pathways. Amongst its properties, it has been shown that RSV acts as an anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, as well as an osteoprotective agent and exercise mimetic, making it an exceptional candidate to help mitigate muscle deconditioning in our partial gravity analog model. We find that a moderate does of RSV appears to blunt reductions in front and back paw grip force as well as partially protect myofiber cross-sectional area in both the soleus and the gastrocnemius. Unlike the studies conducted in animals fully unloaded, we did not treat animals with RSV before exposure, thus assessing if RSV could prevent muscle disuse when given concomitantly. Many other potential therapeutic interventions have been tested in the traditional HU model including: protein supplementation, various antioxidants, allopurinol (pharmaceutical used for treating gout), heat stress, 8-Prenylnaringenin (a prenylflavanoid derived from hop extracts), testosterone, and others. Many of these interventions showing limited success for attenuating HU-induced muscle loss. While some of these interventions in themselves may not fully protect muscle atrophy, there is the possibility for an interaction between partial gravity and an additional intervention, which should not be understated.",

Circadian rhythmicity is the eukaryotic process that regulates physiological functions with a ~24 h cycle. While the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master clock, many organs display a secondary clock that can, in some cases, be asynchronous due to the shift of important cues (e.g., change in feeding time can alter the stomach internal clock). It has been established that circadian rhythms play an important role in many physiological processes on the ground including sleep cycle, gut microbiota, energy metabolism, heart rate and blood pressure, and that disturbances in our innate rhythm can lead to obesity, diabetes, and fertility complications. Onboard the international space station (ISS) astronauts can witness 16 sunrises and sunsets every day, however, indoor lighting is used as a mitigating strategy and simulates a 24-h cycle within the habitat. Astronauts report sleep disturbance more frequently in-flight than on the ground, and sleep deprivation has been associated with a decline in crew performance and a change in alertness levels. Moreover, the cardiovascular system is impacted by circadian rhythm and spaceflight leads to significant alterations in heart rate, blood pressure and cardiovascular rhythms. Similar observations have been made in animal models and in human ground-based analogs such as the 520-d Mars mission; and sex-based differences have been observed between astronauts. Upon arrival on the Moon and Mars, astronauts will experience yet new light-dark cycles, and new ground-based models should now investigate the coupling effect of reduced loading and altered circadian rhythms to develop new and effective countermeasures.",

This radiation exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCR) is problematic for astronauts on low-Earth orbit space (LEO) missions (e.g., missions carried onboard the ISS), but this exposure may be particularly impactful during long duration missions, such as to the Moon or Mars It has long been known that radiation has deleterious effects on physiological systems including on the skeletal, muscular, neurological, immune, and cardiovascular systems. More recent works have begun to establish that radiation and microgravity are associated with a shift in circulating miRNA expression. Taken together, the aggregate of evidence strongly implies radiation in combination with microgravity has the potential for additive effects on human physiology. However, animals in ground-based analog studies are often exposed to an acute dose of radiation meant to represent the total amount received during a potential journey, and often exposed to single or dual beams, which limits our understanding of the short-term consequences of radiation for astronauts who will undertake journeys to the Moon and Mars. As such, future studies will need to investigate the influence of radiation and partial gravity on physiological outcomes. The rat PWB model will allow researchers to assess the coupled effect of mechanical loading and radiation (i.e., the mechanical loading of the Moon coupled with radiation environment on the lunar surface). Moreover, our cages can easily be made radiation-safe (i.e., be used to house animals during exposure without creating artefacts) and could be useful to expose animals to daily doses of radiation and PWB simultaneously.",

With this review we hope to encourage other biomedical investigators to adopt this model within their own laboratories. A combined research effort from many research laboratories will be imperative to thoroughly understand the complex physiology of spaceflight. More so, a broader understanding of spaceflight physiology may also facilitate important discoveries of human physiology that can benefit ground-based medicine. Regardless, to ensure the safety of astronauts in future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond, we need to first understand the complex interactions between human physiology and spaceflight, and the PWB model will play a critical role in unraveling these nuanced relationships.",
