We performed whole transcriptomic profiling of cortical bone using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString) on a hindlimb unloading (HLU) mouse model to identify genes whose mRNA transcript abundances change in response to disuse. Eleven-week old female C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ambulatory loading or HLU for 7 days (n = 8/group). Total RNA from marrow-flushed femoral cortical bone was analyzed on HiSeq and NanoString platforms. The expression of several previously reported genes associated with Wnt signaling and metabolism was altered by HLU. Furthermore, the increased abundance of transcripts, such as Pfkfb3 and Mss51, after HLU imply these genes also have roles in the cortical bone’s response to altered mechanical loading. Our study demonstrates that an unbiased approach to assess the whole transcriptomic profile of cortical bone can reveal previously unidentified mechanosensitive genes and may eventually lead to novel targets to prevent disuse-induced osteoporosis.",

Reduced mechanical loading from extended immobilization, spinal cord injury, or spaceflight leads to decreased bone mass and mineral density in humans, which increases susceptibility to skeletal fractures. Biological mechanisms underlying skeletal deterioration due to reduced mechanical loading have been studied using hindlimb unloading rodent models, which demonstrated altered Wnt or IGF signaling or Rank/Rankl/Opg pathway.

This high-throughput approach can allow identification novel pathways that are altered in response to reduced mechanical loading in rodent models. Prior studies in transgenic mice or mice that underwent increased mechanical loading successfully demonstrated alterations in novel pathways in osteocytes using RNAseq.

In brief, the nCounter gene codeset contains a matched pair 3′ biotinylated capture probe and a 5′reporter probe tagged with a fluorescent barcode, for each of 236 transcripts. Probes are hybridized to 100 ng of total RNA for 19 h at 65°C, after which excess capture and reporter probes are removed and transcript-specific ternary complexes are immobilized on a streptavidin-coated cartridge. Subsequently, all solution manipulations are carried out using the NanoString preparation station robotic fluids handling platform. Data collection is carried out with the nCounter Digital Analyzer to count individual fluorescent barcodes and quantify target RNA molecules present in each sample. Normalization was carried based on a standard curve constructed using spike in exogenous control constructs and the 6 housekeeping genes included in the codeset.",

Recent evidence supports the concept that Pfkfb3 provides a signaling mechanism for Wnt3A, altering osteoblast differentiation. Pfkfb3 was also identified de-novo in a gene enrichment analysis of circulating monocytes in patients with osteoporosis, further suggesting a possible role in modulating the bone microenvironment in the setting of low bone density. Our study adds to the evidence that Pfkfb3 may influence bone metabolism in the context of microgravity, disuse-induced bone loss and osteoporosis.",

The alteration in Mss51 appears to be mediated by focal adhesion kinase, which has been shown to be responsive to mechanical loading via fluid flow shear stress in osteoblasts. Mechanical loading likely alters cell-matrix environment, thereby allowing integrins to initiate intracellular signaling to promote bone adaptation. Hindlimb unloading in rats also decreases focal adhesions in mesenchymal stromal cells, which will have resulted in increased Mss51. These studies demonstrate that while Mss51 is conventionally known to be involved during cell metabolism and energy balance, the gene may also be responsive to mechanical loading/unloading via changes in cell-matrix environment.",

While our study demonstrated that Wnt signaling is implicated to be involved, we did not find that sclerostin or Rankl/Opg to be altered following hindlimb unloading. There are several possible factors that may have contributed to differences in study findings. First, it is possible that methodological differences (RNAseq vs. RT-qPCR) used to assess transcript levels contributed to different outcomes. Second, while we carefully removed bone marrow, surrounding soft tissues, and both ends of bone, the cortical bone lining cells may have contributed to heterogeneity of cell population, leading to blunted effects on several signaling pathways known to be altered by hindlimb unloading in osteocytes or osteoblasts. In addition, whereas we examined day 7 of unloading, earlier time points may be needed to observe robust differences in gene expression due to unloading. Prior studies have demonstrated that bones from 6 to 9 months old rats are more responsive to hindlimb unloading than 28 to 32 months old rats, likely due to increased Bmp2 and Igf1 in younger animals. Finally, hindlimb unloading has been shown to affect other physiologic systems in female 11-week-old mice, such as loss of muscle and increased corticosterone metabolites, which has been shown to inhibit bone formation. Altogether, a variety of factors can contribute to inconsistencies in gene expression across studies. Additional suitably powered and well-controlled studies are needed to resolve reported discrepancies among studies.",

We selected the 7-day timepoint based on our prior studies, but recognize the limitation of this approach which precludes determining the time-course of gene-expression changes. This early timepoint may have led to minimal changes in osteogenic genes in our studies. However, our ability to identify novel genes that may initiate osteogenic responses later, not previously associated with disuse-induced bone loss provides rationale for future studies with multiple timepoints to expand upon the current findings. While there was excellent correlation between the measurements performed with two methods (Fig 2), Nanostring detected more differentially expressed genes than RNAseq (Fig 3). Therefore, although Nanostring can sample a limited, pre-determined portion of cortical bone transcriptome, it can serve as a powerful approach towards identifying mild changes (<2-fold) in transcript abundance.",
