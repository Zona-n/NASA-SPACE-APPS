            "text": "Recent research has shown that the microbiota affects the biology of associated host epithelial tissues, including their circadian rhythms, although few data are available on how such influences shape the microarchitecture of the brush border. The squid-vibrio system exhibits two modifications of the brush border that supports the symbionts: effacement and repolarization. Together these occur on a daily rhythm in adult animals, at the dawn expulsion of symbionts into the environment, and symbiont colonization of the juvenile host induces an increase in microvillar density. Here we sought to define how these processes are related and the roles of both symbiont colonization and environmental cues. Ultrastructural analyses showed that the juvenile-organ brush borders also efface concomitantly with daily dawn-cued expulsion of symbionts. Manipulation of the environmental light cue and juvenile symbiotic state demonstrated that this behaviour requires the light cue, but not colonization. In contrast, symbionts were required for the observed increase in microvillar density that accompanies post dawn brush-border repolarization; this increase was induced solely by host exposure to phosphorylated lipid A of symbiont cells. These data demonstrate that a partnering of environmental and symbiont cues shapes the brush border and that microbe-associated molecular patterns play a role in the regulation of brush-border microarchitecture.",

            "text": "Perhaps, the most common type of animal symbiosis, whether pathogenic, commensal or mutualistic, is the interaction of microbial cells along the apical surfaces of polarized host epithelia (for reviews, see). At these interfaces, the partners influence one another’s form and function. For example, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) efface the brush border and hijack the cytoskeletal proteins of the epithelia to create features that promote pathogenesis. The microbiota of both invertebrates and vertebrates can induce an increase in the density of microvilli and, reciprocally, microvillus-derived vesicles of the brush border help to communicate with and control bacterial populations. In addition, it has long been known that epithelial tissues associated with microbes, such as the gut, are on profound daily rhythms. Only recently, however, has it been demonstrated that the microbial partners play a role in the control of these rhythms, but the extent to which daily rhythms affect the microarchitecture of the brush border has not been characterized.",

Early studies of the association demonstrated that colonization of the host animal induces ultrastructural changes in the epithelial cells of crypts where symbionts take up residence. The epithelium of the newly hatched juvenile host begins as a simple, columnar epithelial layer with sparse microvilli (Fig. S1A). Upon symbiont colonization, these epithelial cells increase in volume fourfold to take on a cuboidal morphology. In addition, the density and complexity of microvilli increases such that symbiont cells, while remaining extracellular, become surrounded by host membranes (; Fig. S1A). These observed changes were derived from data taken at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h following colonization, i.e., at times that would not capture daily rhythms.",

A recent study of the adult transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrated that host cytoskeletal genes are highly regulated in the hours around dawn. These changes in gene expression correlate with a blebbing off of the microvilli of the crypt epithelial brush border, not unlike that observed in EPEC pathogenesis; this effacement is followed by a re-formation of the microvillous brush border (Fig. S1B). A subsequent study of the system revealed that the symbionts control transcriptional regulation of clock genes of a peripheral circadian rhythm specific to the light organ. Taken together, these data showed that the squid-vibrio symbiosis displays a profound daily rhythm.",

            "text": "Previous studies showed that the phenomenon of daily venting of symbionts by adult E. scolopes depends on an exogenous ‘dawn’ light cue, i.e., onset of light in animals entrained to a 12:12 light/dark (L/D) cycle. However, the timing of venting relative to exposure of the animal to light had not been resolved, data that are critical to further analyses of brush-border dynamics. Thus, we designed experiments to observe and manipulate venting in the juvenile squid, which also display venting behaviour, but are more experimentally manipulable. In these assays, individual animals were maintained in vials, but removed from these vials at time points before and after a light cue to measure the presence or absence of V. fischeri luminescence in the water. As in adult animals, symbiont venting in juveniles maintained on a 12:12 L/D cycle occurred following the light cue of dawn (Fig. 1). As the symbionts were vented, luminescence increased and peaked by ~2 h after the cue. This peak was followed by a decline in the amount of luminescence to undetectable levels by ~6 h post onset of environmental light, because of the loss of luminescence activity that results from absence of nutrients to the expelled symbionts (Lee and Ruby, 1994). However, animals entrained on a 12:12 L/D cycle and then exposed to a delayed dawn of up to 10 h did not show venting until after the delayed light cue was presented, i.e., dependence on a light cue persisted for several hours after the entrained dawn; however, after 10 h without a light cue, the animals begin to vent spontaneously (Fig. S2). These data demonstrated that the venting behaviour is not on an entrained circadian rhythm and that the timing of the cue can be experimentally manipulated independent of circadian behaviours for up to 10 h.",

Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we quantified microvilli along epithelial apical surfaces (Fig. 2A – C). All experiments were performed with animals at 24 h post inoculation or longer, when the light organ is fully colonized and daily rhythms are reliably occurring. Effacement was detected as soon as 5 min after the dawn cue at 36 h post-hatching. Microvillar density at this time was 55–65% of that observed at 24 h post-hatching, or at ‘dusk’ of the first day (Fig. 2D); maximal microvillar density also occurs around dusk in light organs of adult animals. By 38 h post-hatching, or ~2 h after the light cue, the microvillar density had decreased to 25–35% of that at dusk (Fig. 2D). Both symbiotic (Sym) and aposymbiotic (Apo) animals showed a similar, significant decrease in microvillar density in response to the dawn cue (34–36 h P < 0.001 for Sym and Apo), indicating that the effacement was not dependent upon colonization state. In addition, the effacement was localized to the microvilli and did not extend into the crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 2E), as was seen previously in adult squid. These data demonstrate that effacement occurs in juvenile animals and is independent of symbiotic state.",

The crypt-cell microvilli significantly decreased in number beginning 5 min after the light cue independent of whether the cue was given early, at normal dawn, or after normal dawn (Fig. 3). However, the decrease occurred slightly more slowly in animals presented an early light cue as shown by a significant decrease in microvillar density between 0 and 2 h after the light cue in the animals given an early light cue (P < 0.05), but not in those given light cues at normal dawn or after normal dawn (Fig. 3; 6 h early/late), suggesting that the nadir in microvillar density was reached more quickly in those animals presented with a normal or late light cue.

These data suggest that the induction of symbiont-mediated microvillar growth is not dependent upon bacterial density or bacterial light. Symbionts also induce a fourfold increase in volume of host crypt epithelial cells, which is light dependent, but not dependent on colonization level. Both the Δlux-colonized and the aposymbiotic animals showed this significantly smaller cell width as compared with wild type and lysA-colonized animals (Fig. 4B; lower P < 0.001), demonstrating that the symbiosis-mediated increase in microvillar density was not coupled to the cell swelling phenotype.",

However, the microvillar density of animals exposed to AP-treated LPS was slightly but significantly higher than that of aposymbiotic animals (P<0.05), suggesting that either not all of the phosphate groups were cleaved from the LPS molecule during AP treatment or that another portion of the V. fischeri LPS molecule works together with the phosphorylated lipid A to affect host crypt-cell microvillar density.",

Instead, evidence presented here suggests that the brush border effacement of the squid light organ, which is embryonically gut derived, requires a light cue. Circadian rhythms, which are principally entrained by light cues, control numerous cellular processes of the mammalian gut, although, to our knowledge, the influences of rhythms on brush-border ultrastructure and cues that might mediate any such changes have not been reported. However, the light-cued central clock of the brain entrains the peripheral clock that, in turn, regulates epithelial function of the intestine (Pacha and Sumova, 2013). As such, analysis of the mammalian intestinal epithelium for changes in the brush-border microarchitecture in response to environmental light cues, independent of the microbiota, may be a fruitful research avenue.",

Several studies have focused on the structural and functional similarities of these organs. Although the eye is photoreceptive and the light organ is photogenic, they have similar accessory tissues to modify light, as well as similar biochemistry and developmental induction. Relevant here is that the shedding of microvilli in response to light is common in the rhabdomeric photoreceptors that are characteristic of certain invertebrate eyes, including those of cephalopods. The renewal of portions of photoreceptors is common in both invertebrate and vertebrate eyes as a response to the photo-oxidative reactions that can ultimately lead to retinal degeneration. The behaviour shedding of the microvilli in rhabdomeric eyes thus serves to renew the microvilli of the retinal cells each day. As with other characters of the light organ that appear to be co-opted from the eye, effacement behaviour may serve a similar function, i.e., to renew the host’s cellular interface with the bacterial partner on a daily basis in response to oxidative stress imposed by the symbiosis.",

Notably, at ~4 weeks, a rhythm of symbiont metabolism ensues that correlates with a daily acidification and a change in the oxygen availability in the crypts. Whereas the relative anatomical and biochemical simplicity of the juvenile organ revealed the lack of a role of the symbiont in effacement, the complexity of the adult organ renders such a determination challenging, if not impossible.",

In many cases, bacterial alterations of the brush border result in a more intimate association of the bacterial cells with host cell membranes, similar to what has been observed in early colonization of the squid-host crypts by V. fischeri (Fig. S1). For example, the attaching and effacing activity of EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli is followed by a complex set of events in which the pathogen hijacks the host cytoskeleton to produce ‘pedestals’ at the site of attachment that cradle the pathogen and promote pathogenesis. More subtle effects occur with the early colonization of nasopharyngeal epithelia by Neisseria meningitidis; following attachment to the epithelium, this opportunistic pathogen recruits host cytoskeletal proteins to induce elongation of the brush-border microvilli. Although these phenomena have been studied for decades in pathogens, new data demonstrate that normal colonization by the microbiota can also affect the brush border; manipulation of the microbiota diversity and abundance by antibiotics and probiotics can influence the density of intestinal-cell epithelia.",

Several bacterial pathogens, such as EPEC, use type III secretion systems to introduce effector molecules directly into host-cell cytoplasm. In a study of N. meningitidis pathogenesis, the biophysical force exerted by type IV pili was implicated in driving the elongation of the microvilli, but the precise mechanism of this action was not determined. A recent study of EPEC, which also requires type IV pili for virulence, has shown that the influence of the biophysical forces exerted by the pili is likely indirect. The data provide evidence that the pili serve simply to draw the pathogen closer to the host cell membranes, which promotes the opportunity for full virulence of the type III secretion system. Such phenomena may occur in the squid-vibrio system, wherein presentation of lipid A requires interaction of host cells with symbiont pili; V. fischeri encodes eight type IV pili that may function individually or in combination to facilitate signalling and colonization.",

The molecular basis of how these outer membrane vesicles signal to the host may be through the light-organ pattern-recognition receptors. The light organ expresses numerous pattern-recognition receptors. One of these, a LPS binding protein, EsLBP1, binds V. fischeri LPS, and the gene that encodes for this protein is upregulated about 20-fold in the crypt spaces in response to peptidoglycan derivatives, and not LPS, of the colonizing symbiont.

Several contributions report that the activity of secreted host AP dephosphorylates, and thus ‘detoxifies’, lipid A in symbiotic systems, including the squid-vibrio association and the intestinal-microbiota symbioses of the vertebrate gut. AP activity fluctuates over the day–night cycle in both juveniles and adults, being highest mid-day, and low around the time of effacement (Fig. 6A). These data would suggest that phosphorylated lipid A delivers the signal for microvilli regrowth around dawn. Studies of the host transcriptome over the day–night cycle demonstrate that genes encoding host cytoskeletal proteins are upregulated in the hours before dawn, suggesting that the tissues are biochemically primed for the lipid A signal of the symbiont. Finally, in recent studies of both pathogens and members of the microbiota, the dephosphylation of their lipid A renders them more resistant to the activity of antimicrobial peptides, a consequence that may also occur in the squid-vibrio symbiosis.",

The early symbiosis is a time of rapid changes in the light organ with an underlying daily rhythm (Fig. 6A) of effacement and augmented regrowth, with associated fluctuations in AP activity, which mediate a cycle of phosphorylation on the LPS molecule. The complexity of the brush-border ultrastructure of adult crypt epithelia does not suggest that the microvilli continue to increase in their density over the several months of the squid’s life at the rate observed in the first days of the symbiosis. Instead, it appears that the mature association settles down into a rhythm of effacement and regrowth, with much of the critical underlying biochemistry occurring in the hours before and after dawn (Fig. 6B). Future investigations will focus both upon the signalling pathways activated by symbiont lipid A and on the participation of circadian rhythms in the shaping of the brush border. In addition, investigation of other features of the symbiont, such as pili, that may be required for the effective presentation of MAMPs, will be explored. Both bacteria-induced development and bacteria-entrained daily rhythms mediated by clock genes were first described in the squid-vibrio symbiosis and later found in vertebrates. As such, studies of whether the processes described in this contribution also occur in vertebrates may reveal important features of animal-bacterial interactions that are conserved over evolutionary time.",
