We show that when the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 is used to trigger immune responses in mutants missing tonoplast Ca2+ pumps, it causes disrupted Ca2+ signals that are higher in amplitude than expected from wild-type plants. Relocalization of a Ca2+ pump normally found in the plasma membrane to the tonoplast rescues both the tonoplast pump knockout mutant’s immune-related phenotypes and aberrant Ca2+ signaling dynamics. These observations support the notion that tonoplast-localized pumps are critical for the proper maintenance of Ca2+ dynamics in innate immune responses but that any regulatory systems specific to the endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be required to support these signaling events.",

            "text": "One of the major events of early plant immune responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol following pathogen recognition. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency. Despite the wealth of observations showing that the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22 triggers Ca2+ transients, there remain limited data defining the molecular identities of Ca2+ transporters involved in shaping the cellular Ca2+ dynamics during the triggering of the defense response network. However, the autoinhibited Ca2+-ATPase (ACA) pumps that act to expel Ca2+ from the cytosol have been linked to these events, with knockouts in the vacuolar members of this family showing hypersensitive lesion-mimic phenotypes. We have therefore explored how the two tonoplast-localized pumps, ACA4 and ACA11, impact flg22-dependent Ca2+ signaling and related defense responses. The double-knockout aca4/11 exhibited increased basal Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ signals of higher amplitude than wild-type plants. Both the aberrant Ca2+ dynamics and associated defense-related phenotypes could be suppressed by growing the aca4/11 seedlings at elevated temperatures. Relocalization of ACA8 from its normal cellular locale of the plasma membrane to the tonoplast also suppressed the aca4/11 phenotypes but not when a catalytically inactive mutant was used. These observations indicate that regulation of vacuolar Ca2+ sequestration is an integral component of plant immune signaling, but also that the action of tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps does not require specific regulatory elements not found in plasma membrane-localized pumps.",

One of the best characterized of these sensing networks is through plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These PRRs bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): That is, conserved molecular signals of pathogen presence, such as bacterial flagellin or fungal chitin. Upon PAMP-binding, the PRRs trigger an immune response termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) that can lead to the rapid development of both local and plant-wide defense (systemic acquired resistance). The best-characterized of the PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2). This protein acts with a coreceptor, BAK1, and is responsible for recognizing bacterial flagellin (or minimally the flg22 peptide epitope within flagellin) and triggers the signaling systems that lead to PTI.",

            "text": "Induction of these local and systemic responses involves the activation of myriad cellular signaling events at sites of pathogen perception, such as protein phosphorylation cascades, production of reactive oxygen species, anion fluxes, and apoplastic alkalization. One of these major hallmarks of early PTI responses is a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the cytosol immediately after PAMP recognition. The subsequent change in cytosolic Ca2+ level is then thought to play a role in triggering downstream responses. Indeed, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ are recognized as ubiquitous elements of cellular signaling networks and are thought to encode stimulus-specific information in their duration, amplitude, and frequency: Their so-called “calcium signature”. Calcium signatures are determined by an interplay between Ca2+ permeable channels, exchangers, and pumps. Two cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs 2 and 4) have emerged as likely key players in the Ca2+ influx supporting the flg22-triggered signaling system under nonlimiting soil Ca2+ levels. However, other channels are likely also involved as the cngc2/4 double mutant attenuates, but does not abolish, the flg22-induced Ca2+ change. Similarly, although CNGC2 and -4 are thought to mediate Ca2+ influx at the plasma membrane, whether release from internal Ca2+ stores plays a major role in these signaling events remains to be fully characterized. Despite this important role for channels in generating such defense-related Ca2+ signals, building evidence also suggests an important role for Ca2+ efflux pumps in innate immune Ca2+ signaling. In particular, mutants of P2B-type ATPases, or autoinhibited calcium ATPases (ACAs), have been shown to exhibit aberrant patterns of PTI.",

Conversely, disruption of the tonoplast ACAs, ACA4 and ACA11, renders plants to be constitutively defense responsive, but whether these phenotypes are related to aberrations in Ca2+ signaling remains unknown. We report that aca4/11 mutants show elevated basal Ca2+ and an increased Ca2+ signal in response to flg22. Elevated temperature is known to suppress defense-response phenotypes and growth at high temperatures rescued both the altered Ca2+ dynamics and aberrant downstream pathogen responses. Furthermore, we report that the relocalization of a plasma membrane ACA (ACA8) to the tonoplast rescues the aca4/11 phenotype. These observations imply that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumping is integral to maintaining homeostatic Ca2+ levels and for the initiation of proper PTI responses. However, because the relocalized plasma membrane pump can rescue the tonoplast knockout phenotypes, any regulatory motifs specific to the tonoplast pumps may not be required to support normal Ca2+ signaling in the flg22-triggered response network.",

            "text": "The aca4/11 tonoplast ACA pump knockout shows an enhanced defense response, but its effects on Ca2+ dynamics are unstudied. We therefore monitored cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 plants expressing the ratiometric, genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based Ca2+ sensor YC-Nano65. As Ca2+ levels increase, the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) signal from YC-Nano65 falls and the FRET signal from the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) partner in the sensor increases. An increasing change in the FRET:CFP ratio (∆R) therefore reflects increasing cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]Cyt). aca4/11 mutants spontaneously form lesions around the time of inflorescence bolting, so we only imaged plants that had not yet developed lesions to mitigate potential imaging artifacts from dead cells. We obtained the mean FRET:CFP ratio values over 3 h for entire rosette leaves of Col-0 and aca4/11 and observed a significant elevation in baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 plants (Fig. 1). Similarly, we tested [Ca2+]Cyt values in intact and detached cotyledons of 10-d-old seedlings and observed a similar pattern of basal [Ca2+]Cyt elevation in aca4/11 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). Such a sustained Ca2+ elevation may be associated with lesion formation as the infiltration of leaves with an avirulent strain of the phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst) has also been reported to elicit sustained Ca2+ elevations that preceded hypersensitive lesion formation.",

            "text": "The formation of spontaneous hypersensitive lesions is a characteristic of lesion-mimic mutants and indicative of a deregulated immune response, implying that aca4/11 may be showing a similar disruption in defense signaling. Thus, we decided to test the Ca2+ signaling response to the PAMP flg22 in the aca4/11 background. We first established that 1 μM flg22 elicited a clear Ca2+ increase in Col-0 and was below the saturating concentration for the response (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Using this 1-µM concentration as our treatment, we found that flg22 elicited a larger Ca2+ increase in aca4/11 rosette leaves and cotyledons when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 2, SI Appendix, Fig. S3, and Movies S1–S4), suggesting that tonoplast-localized ACAs are important for the proper efflux of Ca2+ from the cytoplasm during signaling events related to PAMP perception. ACA4 and ACA11 are ubiquitously expressed, as is the FLS2 receptor, and so we asked whether Ca2+ signaling in response to flg22 was generically disrupted in the double-mutant background in our experiments to help us focus on where ACA4- and ACA11-dependent events were likely to be most prominent. Therefore, we grew plants under the same conditions where aca4/11 showed differences in the flg22-triggered cotyledon Ca2+ response but assayed responses in the root. SI Appendix, Fig. S4 shows that we could detect both the previously documented flg22-induced inhibition of root growth and flg22-triggered Ca2+ increase at the root tip in wild-type Col-0 seedlings, indicating that seedling roots were indeed flg22-responsive under these conditions. However, neither of these flg22-induced responses were significantly different between aca4/11 and Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 A–C). Furthermore, and unlike the shoot tissue, the baseline [Ca2+]Cyt in aca4/11 root tips was not significantly different to Col-0 (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), suggesting a potentially smaller impact on cellular Ca2+ homeostasis of loss of ACA4 and ACA11 function at the root tip than in the shoot of these plants.",

For example, flg22 responses in regions outside of the root tip or in plants of different ages or grown under different conditions may be altered in the aca4/11 background. However, these results are consistent with Behera et al., who similarly saw no shift in baseline Ca2+ and little effect on root tip Ca2+ signaling in response to exogenous ATP in aca4/11 roots. Taking these observations together suggested to us that focusing on analyses of shoot rather than root responses should be the most likely to reveal aca4/11-dependent events. Thus, since our results indicated that aca4/11 defense-signaling phenotypes appear prominent in the shoot tissue, where the lesion-mimic phenotype manifests, and are evident in both mature leaves and cotyledons, we decided to concentrate subsequent analyses on these aerial parts of the plant, using the cotyledons as our major organ for assay of Ca2+ responses.",

In order to discriminate between these possibilities for the altered Ca2+ response in the aca4/11 background, we used confocal ratio imaging to follow changes after flg22 addition with single-cell resolution. This approach allowed us to ask how uniform the cellular response was in the aca4/11 plants. Fig. 3 shows that the elevated response appears homogeneous within responding cells (Fig. 3A) and is mirrored in both individual cellular response in different regions across the organ and in the average response of a subregion of the cotyledon (Fig. 3 B and C).

            "text": "Many lesion-mimic mutants exhibit lesion suppression when grown in elevated temperatures, likely due to reduced biosynthesis of the phytohormone salicylic acid. While aca4/11 plants grown at 22 °C exhibited dwarfism and eventually formed lesions, growth at 28 °C suppressed both of these aca4/11 phenotypes, an effect that became more obvious as the plants grew larger rosettes (Fig. 4A). We also used molecular markers of the flg22 response to characterize how aca4/11 may affect induction of defense pathways. We first characterized that in wild-type, a 30-min time point after flg22 treatment captured the induction of CPB60g, PHI1, ICS1, and FRK1, all components of PTI induction. We also confirmed that the basal expression of these genes was not significantly altered in the various genotypes or under the temperature regimes used in the absence of flg22 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Importantly, FRK1 encodes a receptor-like protein kinase that is thought to function in a pathway independent of the flg22-signaling events mediated through the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases CPK4, -5, -6, and -11. Thus, FRK1 provided us with a marker that may operate independently of Ca2+ signal dynamics, and so of aca4/11-related effects. Indeed, we observed that the 30-min flg22-dependent increase in FRK1, PHI1, and ICS1 transcripts were unaltered in the aca4/11 background when compared to wild-type Col-0 plants (Fig. 4B). However, induction of the defense regulator CBP60g and resistance to Pst bacterial challenge (seen as a reduction in extractable colony forming units of bacteria) were both elevated in aca4/11 plants, with the resistance phenotype being most evident over the initial invasion at 1 d postinoculation (1 DPI) (Fig. 4C). As seen for the dwarfing phenotype, suppression of both flg22-induced elevation of defense gene induction and pathogen resistance occurred in aca4/11 at 28 °C (Fig. 4 B and C).",

Such data provide a clear link between lesioning behavior and these two tonoplast ACAs. The rescue likely works as the native pumps, with all of their regulatory systems, are being reintroduced into the membrane in which they normally operate. Indeed, the ACAs form a multigene family with clades that map to particular organellar membranes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), and thus it seems likely that particular family members are tailored to operate within the lipid milieu and regulatory networks associated with a particular membrane environment. We asked if this idea was true by targeting a nontonoplast ACA to the tonoplast of the aca4/11 double knockout and assessing its ability to rescue the double-knockout phenotypes.",

This is the region where much of this family of pump’s regulation has been localized and where a large amount of its isoform-dependent amino acid sequence diversity resides (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). In order to relocalize ACA8, we deleted its C-terminal tail and replaced it with the analogous region of ACA11 (thus creating the chimeric ACA8-11C). The C terminus of ACA11 contains two sequences indicative of tonoplast localization, a dileucine (DXXXLL) and a tyrosine (YXXΦ) motif, where X is any amino acid and Φ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). Furthermore, we created a version of the ACA8-11C chimeric pump with a point mutation in the P-loop of the core pump region (ACA8-D482A) that converted a conserved aspartate known to be important for pump activity into an alanine, effectively inactivating the pump. For both ACA8-11C and its D482A variant we generated versions tagged at the C terminus with mGFP5 (for localization studies). We also made ACA8-11C with a FLAG tag that we used in Ca2+ imaging experiments as the mGFP5 tag interferes with the imaging of the CFP/YFP-based YC-Nano65 Ca2+ sensor probe we have used. All pump variants were driven by the constitutive AtUBQ10 promoter.",

Further analyses throughout the plant indicated that neither ACA8-11C-mGFP5, D482A-mGFP5, nor γ-TIP-CFP colocalized with the plasma membrane marker FM5-95 in, for example, cells of the root differentiation and elongation zone, leaf guard cells, or in shoot-derived protoplasts, suggesting that ACA8-11C-mGFP5 and D482A-mGFP5 were relocalized from the plasma membrane to the tonoplast (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10).

In this study we showed that tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps appear to not only be modulators of Ca2+ homeostasis, but play an important role in regulating both response to the PAMP flg22 and in the induction of PTI. Plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps have likewise been linked to PAMP signaling, with for example, ACA8 thought to form a complex with the FLS2 receptor. However, knocking out these plasma membrane Ca2+ efflux pumps that would be thought to play roles in limiting and eventually resetting increases in Ca2+ signals, has been reported to actually attenuate PAMP-triggered Ca2+ responses and downstream signaling. In addition, although aca8/10 plants show elevated baseline Ca2+, they do not display spontaneous lesion formation. Taken together, these observations suggest a potentially complex role for the plasma membrane pumps in signal processing outside of their ability to pump out, and so normally limit, PAMP-induced cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals. In contrast, we found that knockouts in the vacuolar ACAs led to elevated baseline Ca2+ within the cell (Fig. 1), a larger flg22-induced Ca2+ increase (Figs. 2 and 3), and elevated levels of downstream PTI responses (Fig. 4B). These observations are all consistent with these tonoplast pumps contributing to maintenance of low basal Ca2+ levels and playing roles in limiting the magnitude of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, signals that are themselves important mediators of PTI signaling.",

Indeed, elevated temperature attenuated the PTI-related Ca2+ dynamics in aca4/11 to wild-type–like characteristics and these changes correlated with rescue of other elevated defense responses, such as defense gene induction and pathogen resistance (Fig. 4 B and C). These higher temperatures affected the attenuation of flg22-dependent Ca2+ signals in both Col-0 and aca4/11 plants (Fig. 4E), suggesting that common temperature-dependent components of the Ca2+ efflux machinery are affected in both genotypes. Although previous studies have indicated that PTI responses, including positive regulation of defense transcripts and MAPK activation, are favored at elevated temperatures, our experiments indicate that Ca2+ signaling, a canonic PTI response, is suppressed at elevated temperature, consistent with reports that defense-response systems are compromised at higher temperatures, likely through alterations in salicylic acid-dependent pathways.",

            "text": "Along with previous work on aca4/11 defense and lesion phenotypes, our study indicates that the activity of ACAs at the tonoplast is important for PTI and normal PAMP-dependent Ca2+ signaling. Using a combination of modeling and direct Ca2+ measurements using aequorin-expressing plants, Lenzoni et al. have shown that not only the characteristics of the rising, but also the falling phase of Ca2+ transients are likely to be important for modulating subsequent defense-related gene expression. However, in our experiments, although aca4/11 had a significantly elevated Ca2+ signal in response to flg22 (Figs. 2B and 3 B and C), both Col-0 and aca4/11 reached basal Ca2+ levels at similar time points (Fig. 6C). This observation indicates that ACA4 and ACA11 are likely important for regulating the net influx of Ca2+ during flg22 perception (i.e., the initial rising phase of the signal), while other efflux systems may be involved in the re-establishment of baseline Ca2+. The Ca2+/H+ exchangers of the tonoplast have similarly been shown to operate in PTI, although the complex they form may act as a response element downstream of the initial perception and signaling machinery. The Ca2+/H+ exchangers are also known to play roles in abiotic stress responses and indeed, previous work has implied that the tonoplast provides a signaling hub for these classes of response. For example, in the moss Physcomitrella patens, knockout of the tonoplast calcium pump PCA1 resulted in NaCl-dependent Ca2+ transients that were higher in amplitude and of longer duration. Thus, it will be of interest to assess whether ACA4 and ACA11 also play roles in abiotic stress-related Ca2+ signaling.",

            "text": "We also show that relocalization of a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump, ACA8, to the tonoplast rescued the phenotypes associated with the aca4/11 tonoplast pump knockout. Several studies have indicated that dileucine motifs are involved in the localization of tonoplast membrane proteins, and so we have capitalized on this machinery to retarget nontonoplast proteins to the tonoplast for functional rescue experiments. Thus, although when we overexpressed native ACA8, it targeted to the plasma membrane (SI Appendix, Fig. S12), expression of this same pump engineered with the C terminus of ACA11 was targeted to the tonoplast, with little indication of a plasma membrane localized fraction (Fig. 5 and SI Appendix, Fig. S10). Relocalization of ACA8 to the tonoplast sometimes led to the formation of “bulb” structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S13), which are believed to be artifacts due to the dimerization of GFP. However, as we used mGFP5—a monomeric form of GFP—that should not dimerize, whether these bulbs are bona fide tonoplast structures potentially enriched in ACA8-11C will require future study.",

            "text": "ACAs are typified by the presence of a calmodulin-binding N-terminal autoinhibitory domain that restricts pump activity and accounts for much of the variability between ACA isoforms (SI Appendix, Fig. S8). The autoinhibitory domain can undergo posttranslational modifications that can potentially modulate the binding capacity of calmodulin or calmodulin-like (CML) proteins. For example, the autoinhibitory domain of ACA8 appears to be regulated by CML36. This region can also be phosphorylated, but in general the molecular identities of the modifiers of ACA action remain undefined. Despite the differences between the N-terminal domains of ACA4, ACA11, and ACA8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), ACA8-11C was still able to functionally rescue the aca4/11 mutant phenotypes. This observation suggests that Ca2+ transport across the tonoplast by an ACA is the critical feature for this signaling system but, at the same time, that it may not require regulatory circuits specifically tailored to Ca2+ pumps normally targeted to this location. The failure of the pump-dead D482A mutant of ACA8-11C to rescue the aca4/11 phenotype reinforces the idea of this essential role for pumping activity. Thus, the proliferation of ACA family pumps through evolutionary time may have been necessitated to specify the localization of pumps to relevant membranes with a divergence event segregating ACAs into plasma membrane and nonplasma membrane localizations. Although specific regulatory events associated with each membrane locale may have evolved, the basic core pumping activity of these transporters appears robust enough to work in varied cellular locations. Similarly, the Ca2+ homeostatic system appears flexible enough to integrate heterologous pumping activity into a system capable of supporting normal Ca2+-based signaling activities. Thus, the Ca2+ signaling system of pumps and channels shows the features of resilience and compensation reminiscent of the scale-free genetic networks that characterize many other cellular regulatory systems.",

Briefly, a Nikon stereomicroscope (SMZ-25) equipped with a 1× objective (P2-SHR PLAN APO, Nikon), W-VIEW image-splitting optics (Hamamatsu), and a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) were used to image 20-d-old rosette leaves of YC-Nano65 expressing plants every 30 s. The cpVenus signal arises from FRET from its CFP partner. As Ca2+ levels rise this FRET signal increases and the CFP emission decreases. Time-series FRET data were normalized via the following equation: ΔR/Ro = (R - Ro)/Ro, where R is the ratio of cpVenus emission (FRET):CFP emission and Ro is the average baseline value of this “FRET ratio” prior to flg22 treatment. FRET ratio data were analyzed using the image calculator tool in FIJI using a region of interest encompassing the entire leaf or cotyledon.
