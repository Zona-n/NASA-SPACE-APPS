This large collection of data enables the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. We review here the various components of the GeneLab platform, including the new data repository web interface, and the GeneLab Online Data Entry (GEODE) web portal, which will support the expansion of the database in the future to include companion non-omics assay data. We discuss our design for GEODE, particularly how it promotes investigators providing more accurate metadata, reducing the curation effort required of GeneLab staff. We also introduce here a new GeneLab Application Programming Interface (API) specifically designed to support tools for the visualization of processed omics data. We review the outreach efforts by GeneLab to utilize the spaceflight data in the repository to generate novel discoveries and develop new hypotheses, including spearheading data analysis working groups, and a high school student training program.

The 2011 National Research Council (NRC) Decadal Survey presaged this ‘wave of change’ almost a decade ago, and called for the development of more powerful informatics technologies to meet the growing needs of these researchers. The Survey also promulgated the use of a systems biology approach by space biosciences investigators, which led to the formation of the GeneLab project (https://genelab.nasa.gov/), a science initiative at NASA to maximize omics data collected from spaceflight and ground simulation experiments, and including the creation in 2014 of the NASA GeneLab data repository (https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/ ). The mission of GeneLab is to maximize the utilization of valuable biospecimens flown in space or exposed to simulated space stressors through the collection and curation of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic (so-called ‘omics’) data, in order to enable the exploration of molecular network responses to space environments using a systems biology approach. Our designs for the data repository continue to be guided by the FAIR principles. To foster open science in space biology research and to stimulate research opportunities based on an integrated multi-omics analysis approach, investigators who generate omics data are encouraged to contact GeneLab for the latest information concerning data submission requirements and procedures. All GeneLab repository data are open-access.",

Approximately half the studies in the GeneLab repository are from experiments conducted in space, and the other half from ground-based (space analogue) environments. Mammalian (primarily rodent and human cell line) investigations account for a majority the studies. Other organisms studied include various flowering plants, (e.g. Arabidopsis thaliana), microbes, nematodes (primarily Caenorhabditis elegans), insects (Drosophila melanogaster), and bony fish. Although, the most prevalent study assay type is transcription profiling, the database also includes studies of protein expression, whole genome sequencing, metabolite profiling, metagenomics, epigenomics and epitranscriptomics. Investigators continue to submit data from new kinds of assays at an ever-increasing rate, particularly new kinds of RNA sequencing assays, such as spatial transcription profiling data.

Largely concurrent with the design of the GeneLab Data Repository, the global scientific community converged on a set of optimal design features for data repositories, now termed the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles. In the area of Findability, the data repository now provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for all submitted datasets. DOIs have guaranteed persistence, and resolution control mechanisms that are centralized (independent of the data source), and provide users of the GeneLab datasets with a way to cite them easily and uniformly. In addition, each version of a dataset (distinguished by changes in data files or in metadata) is tracked in the data repository, and users can opt to see previous versions through the web interface (Figure 3). This ensures persistence of the specific version of data as cited by others. Finally, NASA is currently developing processes for the automated submission to other databases of data submitted first to GeneLab, with the twin goals of making the data more findable from extramural database systems, and reducing the burden to data providers of generating multiple data submissions.",

In order to support systems interoperation and increase data reuse, the GeneLab repository data uses the widely known ISA experiment model for tagging data files with metadata. The ISA model leverages community-developed concept vocabularies (ontologies), so that there is agreement among users on metadata meaning, and therefore data characterization. Furthermore these models support linkage of data values (‘linked data’) so that, for example, biological samples, personnel or resources reused across experiments need only be described once by the first experiment to refer to them. Subsequent investigations that also use these objects then can quickly search for and refer to them in their investigation descriptions.",

This web browser interface (Figure 4) allows users to develop ISA-tab sets of metadata through either a guided submission ‘wizard’, in which users create metadata step-by-step, or ‘Study Overview’ method, in which metadata can be arbitrarily edited. Data submitters and GeneLab curation staff can both create metadata using GEODE; submitters are limited to editing only their own submitted metadata, while GeneLab curation staff can access and edit all metadata. The web interface provides the capability for submitters (or curators) to look up metadata concepts in online ontologies dynamically, which reduces metadata normalization effort of the curation staff. Furthermore, GEODE provides continuously available data set editing for submitters (or curators), so that they can rapidly and efficiently update and correct their data; any data set owner (or curator) can change the status of their published data sets to ‘In Review’, make changes to the data/metadata, and re-submit it for release at any time.",

Improvements in this API now enables users to query the database for samples, potentially across multiple datasets and assays, by combinations of values of metadata fields, and then to retrieve sample-associated experiment data. Both the data and the accompanying annotations are returned in a tabular format suitable for downstream processing in a variety of languages and environments commonly used by data scientists. This, in turn, empowers researchers to conduct multi-dataset and multi-omics analyses, such as investigating the impact of single experiment factors on a variety of organisms during space flight. For example, the API can be leveraged to interrogate the entirety of the GeneLab database for RNA-Seq assay gene expression counts from all samples from Mus musculus that experienced a specified level of ionizing radiation; such a request returns gene counts from multiple datasets as well as all other metadata values associated with the samples (status of space flight, radiation dose, diet, age, etc.), immediately providing the end-user with data and annotations suitable to build a complex model that accounts for all main and confounding factors known to the database. The API also supports queries for multiple assay types, for example, all transcriptomic and epigenomic assays, facilitating multi-omics data analyses. This enhanced API layer is currently being leveraged within GeneLab to provide advanced data visualizations of GeneLab processed data. These include a data table browser for sample data and annotations, and common statistical data visualizations such as principal component analysis, in a web-browser interface. Finally, we should note that, as the data API leverages the versatile ISA-Tab format to bring annotations to data files, this API could be easily extended to numerous types of assay data, not just omics.",

However, anonymizing astronaut data presents a unique challenge as the cohort is indeed extremely small, and very few metadata (e.g. just gender and flight dates) may be used to identify individuals. Nevertheless, to achieve greater reuse of these data, they too should be made part of an Open Science framework using FAIR principles. They should be stored in non-proprietary formats based on open (community-derived) standards, with open access and with linkages to other data that provide important context. This goal was nicely summarized by Higman et al., ‘data should be as open as possible, as closed as necessary’. More effort should be put into identifying what types of data can remain open, even if one can identify the individuals to which they belong. For example, gene expression levels do not present any sensitive information in the context of the response to stresses like microgravity and radiation. Such information should therefore be made available through open science frameworks as soon as these data are released for publication by investigators. Any information revealing sensitive and personal information, such as that which can be derived from DNA or RNA sequences, would remain access-controlled.",

Most risk models have been focusing on space radiation and cancer. The strong epidemiological data on cancer risk from ionizing radiation and the existence of accelerators dedicated to simulating space radiation have been the main thrust behind these risk models. Ionizing radiation is an easy-to-use experimental factor, with good quantitative input and output, enabling mathematical models. Briefly, scientists control precisely the dose, the dose rate and the type of radiation delivered and they can measure precisely short-term endpoints such as DNA double strand breaks. Interestingly, such responses have been shown to be modulated by the genetic background of an individual, eventually leading to DNA mutations and cancer. Because modelling requires quantitative data, omics data are very well suited to informing risk models and to tackling more challenging stressors such as microgravity. The growing amount of omics data generated by NASA principal investigators and the recent guidelines from NASA emphasizing the importance of submitting all omics data to GeneLab are therefore exciting developments for modellers. Indeed, the software architecture designed by GeneLab and its strategies around data and metadata harmonization will enable the development of the next generation of space risk models. By classifying experimental factors into digital objects and by transforming raw data into comparable quantitative endpoints using a workflow approved by the community, GeneLab lets users see how space factors affect a large array of biological processes. By establishing mathematical laws describing the relationship between factors’ values and biological endpoints, one can start building more elaborate computer models. By integrating information from other NASA databases with more qualitative data (e.g. immunocytochemistry, behavioural data) using the same metadata schema and harmonization strategies, GeneLab can continue to evolve as a knowledge-based system, fully leveraging advances in machine learning, providing insights on enabling human life in space, and enabling individualized space risk models for precision space medicine.",
