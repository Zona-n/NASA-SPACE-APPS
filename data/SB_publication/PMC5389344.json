Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same precursor cells, adipocyte differentiation may occur at the expense of osteoblast differentiation. We used MAT-deficient KitW/W−v (MAT-) mice to determine if absence of MAT reduced bone loss in hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice. Male MAT- and wild-type (WT) mice were randomly assigned to a baseline, control or HU group (n = 10 mice/group) within each genotype and HU groups unloaded for 2 weeks. Femurs were evaluated using micro-computed tomography, histomorphometry and targeted gene profiling. MAT- mice had a greater reduction in bone volume fraction after HU than did WT mice. HU MAT- mice had elevated cancellous bone formation and resorption compared to other treatment groups as well as a unique profile of differentially expressed genes. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells reconstituted c-kit but not MAT in KitW/W−v mice. The MAT- WT → KitW/W−v mice lost cancellous bone following 2 weeks of HU. In summary, results from this study suggest that MAT deficiency was not protective, and was associated with exaggerated disuse-induced cancellous bone loss.",

This association has been observed in humans in iliac crest biopsies and with non-invasive use of magnetic resonance imaging, and in animal models for aging, postmenopausal osteoporosis and disuse. Increased MAT was reported in humans following long-duration bedrest and in rodents during spaceflight. Both osteoblasts and adipocytes differentiate from mesenchymal stem cells in the presence of specific transcription factors. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from the same progenitor pool within the bone marrow, it is possible that one cell type could be produced at the expense of the other. However, a causal relationship has yet to be demonstrated. Thus, while conditions of disuse create a change in balance of cellular function within the bone marrow, it is not clear whether the concurrently observed infiltration of bone marrow fat actively contributes to bone loss.",

These mice have a loss of function mutation in c-kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, located on selective hematopoietic lineage cells. Since an inverse relationship between MAT accumulation and bone mass has been observed, we hypothesized that if MAT plays a causative role, MAT- mice would be resistant to disuse-induced bone loss. To test this hypothesis, we utilized hindlimb unloading (HU) as a ground-based model for spaceflight. The HU model produces skeletal changes in hindlimbs of rodents similar to those observed in astronauts following spaceflight. We therefore compared the skeletal response of adult male WT mice and MAT- mice to HU.",

Interestingly, osteoclast perimeter was also higher in MAT- mice. Presumably, the unbalanced bone turnover responsible for a higher cancellous bone volume fraction in MAT- mice is due, in part, to the previously described defect in osteoclast activity in these mice.",

HU resulted in higher bone formation in the metaphysis of MAT-mice, as well as higher osteoclast perimeter.

The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. Few studies have evaluated effects of either spaceflight or disuse on MAT in mice. Thus, we cannot be certain that additional factors, including species, gender, age, duration of skeletal unloading and housing conditions, impact MAT accumulation during HU. The present study differs from earlier work in that mice in the present study were housed at thermoneutral temperature (32 °C). This may be relevant because MAT levels are reduced in mice by housing at room temperature. Limitations of the present study include the relatively short duration of unloading and exclusive use of males. While the skeletons of male and female rats were reported to respond similarly to HU, gender comparisons have not been performed in mice. Whatever the precise mechanism for the discrepancy in MAT accumulation during skeletal unloading, our results indicate an increase in MAT is not a prerequisite for HU-induced cancellous bone loss.",

When non-significant interactions were present, group comparisons were made from two-way ANOVA with main effects for genotype and treatment. Means for bone marrow adiposity, adipocyte density and adipocyte size were compared using t-tests, since the absence of marrow adiposity in KitW/W−v mice made the use of two-way ANOVA invalid. Means among baseline, control and HU groups within genotype were compared using one-way ANOVA. When the ANOVA was significant, Dunnett’s test was used to make comparisons to the baseline group.
