            "text": "The forces generated by gravity have shaped life on Earth and impact gene expression and morphogenesis during early development. Conversely, disuse on Earth or during spaceflight, reduces normal mechanical loading of organisms, resulting in altered cell and tissue function. Although gravity mechanical loading in adult mammals is known to promote increased cell proliferation and differentiation, little is known about how distinct cell types respond to gravity mechanostimulation during early development. In this study we sought to understand, with single cell RNA-sequencing resolution, how a 60-min pulse of 50 g hypergravity (HG)/5 kPa hydrostatic pressure, influences transcriptomic regulation of developmental processes in the embryoid body (EB) model. Our study included both day-9 EBs and progenitor mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with or without the HG pulse. Single cell t-distributed stochastic neighbor mapping shows limited transcriptome shifts in response to the HG pulse in either ESCs or EBs; this pulse however, induces greater positional shifts in EB mapping compared to ESCs, indicating the influence of mechanotransduction is more pronounced in later states of cell commitment within the developmental program. More specifically, HG resulted in upregulation of self-renewal and angiogenesis genes in ESCs, while in EBs, HG loading was associated with upregulation of Gene Ontology-pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. Cluster transcriptome analysis of the EBs show HG promotes maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in early development; including EB cluster co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm phenotypes with HG pulse but expression exclusivity in the non-pulsed clusters. Pseudotime analysis identified three branching cell types susceptible to HG induction of cell fate decisions. In totality, this study provides novel evidence that ESC maintenance and EB development can be regulated by gravity mechanostimulation and that stem cells committed to a differentiation program are more sensitive to gravity-induced changes to their transcriptome.",

The mechanical environment, defined by unit gravity on Earth, is one such influencer, modulating cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions via physical strain sensing through integrin and cadherin adhesion receptor signaling. These physical strains are then converted into cell signaling and transcriptional responses by a process termed mechanotransduction. In a whole organism the tissue mechanical environment can be regulated by intrinsic factors such as blood pressure, muscle contraction, and others, or by extrinsic factors such as gravity weight-bearing and posture. Also, of importance are the cyclic nature of these normal loading and unloading processes.",

In the unique environment of space, free fall-induced weightlessness can modulate the intrinsic factors of tissue mechanical environment leading to reduced mechanical loads in tissue niche environments. Modeling the effects of microgravity on Earth has been attempted with a multitude of strategies; however, many of these strategies in an effort to replicate free fall, generate non-physiologic fluid shear and rotational loading to the cells. The interesting observation that traditional static cell culture plating results in pressure loading well below the physiologically relevant range may provide a unique path for cellular level modeling of the microgravity free fall environment.",

A 2010 study presented data that controlling the speed of hydrodynamic stimulation changes viability of the cells within the spheroid. More direct stretch mechanical loading increases angiogenesis within the EB and increases the localization of beating cardiomyocyte foci. Dynamic cyclic stretch to EBs encourages differentiation toward mesodermal lineages with the resulting terminal cell type selectable by manipulating the compressive and tensile strains.",

Hanging drop and suspension EB cultures found increased apoptotic cell accumulations and irregular morphology in comparison to rotary fluid shear EB culture, although these may be explained by decreased mass transport around and inside EB. EBs space flown in low earth orbit for 15 days under microgravity conditions retained self-renewal markers and showed inhibition of ESC differentiation and germ layer lineage markers, however, upon return to earth-normal 1 g loading, the EBs demonstrated increased ability to readily differentiate into beating cardiomyocytes. These results mirror findings that EBs derived from ESCs exposed to fluidic shear stress before aggregation are primed for differentiation, resulting in increased endothelial markers and spatial organization.",

Specifically, we show that a 60-min 50 g/5 kPa HG pulse resulted in cells during early development maintaining transitory phenotypes, and having enhanced expression of germ layer lineage markers. This study further defines the power of gravity loading in regulating stem cell self-renewal and differentiation by identification of transcriptomic patterns in stem cells and developmental processes, which can aid in understanding how gravity can be leveraged to elicit regenerative responses; benefiting in vitro platforms for organoid tissue culture, and regenerative medicine.",
