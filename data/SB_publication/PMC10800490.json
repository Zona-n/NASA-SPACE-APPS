Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (μ g) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683) which were upregulated in microgravity, while several of their corresponding target genes were found to be downregulated in microgravity. Interestingly, the downregulated target genes are enriched in those encoding chloroplast-localized enzymes and proteins. These results uncover microgravity unique transcriptional changes and highlight the validity and importance of an onboard 1 g control.",

A recent meta-analysis by Barker et al. clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects. The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls. A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots. Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space.",

Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions.",

Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous light, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light/8h dark). Images were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21% O2 and a constant seedling temperature of 24°C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO2 levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning ~370 ppm and equilibrating to ~760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21% O2, 24°C daytime seedling temperature, and 21°C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO2 for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (~3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by real-time telemetry to record O2, CO2, seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1 g cassettes handled first, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80°C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory.

A single seed cassette was retrieved from the freezer, and the cover was removed. The cassette base was placed on a chilled platform, and RNA-later (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. AM7021) was added. The seedlings were dissected into root and shoot fractions and stored at 4°C in RNA-later for 24 hours, followed by storage at -20°C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from each shoot sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Applied Biosystems Cat No. AM1931). RNA recovery and integrity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). For the PRR shoot samples, the RNA isolation protocol was modified in order to retain the small RNA fraction as well.",

The dry seed configuration with an on-orbit hydration also eliminated the need for late loading and allowed for flexibility in the event of flight scrubbing or delayed experiment initiation. Following hydration and illumination, seedlings from PS and PRR germinated with high frequency ( Supplementary Table 1 ) and exhibited nominal growth across each run of both experiments. Differences in experimental design ( Figure 1 ) included the presence/absence of a day/night cycle, total experiment length, and centrifugal profiles. Notably, PS incorporated 48 hours of initial 1 g treatment at the start of the experiment. For the later experiment, PRR, the μ g rotor remained stationary for the entire duration of the experiment. A morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in PS, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in PRR ( Figure 2 ). This difference could be due to the initial gravitational cue provided to all seedlings in PS, the presence of a day/night cycle in PRR, or a combination of the two. Despite a small degree of variation from seed cassette to seed cassette, each experiment provided a sufficient amount of healthy plant tissue for downstream analysis, and only those cassettes which exhibited nominal growth and development were selected for downstream analysis ( Supplementary Figure 3 ).",

Specifically, SPCH, WOX3, TCP22, GATA2, HFR1, several GRFs, as well as TFs mediating auxin responses and brassinosteroid (BR) signaling were upregulated in the μ g condition relative to 1 g controls. The upregulated list also included 8 TFs belonging to the Apetala2/Ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily, of which cytokinin response factors (CRF4 and CRF5) and Aintegumenta (ANT) play established roles in cell proliferation and embryo, cotyledon and leaf development.",

SAURs were first characterized as rapidly induced in response to auxin, although a few SAURs are repressed by auxin. Of the 11 SAURs identified in this dataset, 10 are induced by auxin; SAUR15 and SAUR16 may also be induced by Gibberellic acid (GA) and Brassinosteroids. SAURs 13-16 are classified as lirSAURs that are light-regulated in cotyledons and hypocotyls and directly interact with phytochrome interacting factors (PIF)s. Overexpression of SAUR36 and SAUR41 increases cell expansion and promotes hypocotyl elongation. SAUR36 is implicated in leaf growth senescence, and SAUR76 may act as a negative regulator of leaf expansion by regulating cell division. SAUR15 is involved in the shade avoidance response and is a potential target of PIF4. Interestingly, SAUR15 expression has been shown to increase on the lower flank of inflorescence stems 30 min following gravistimulation.",

Three of the ARFs detected in this dataset (ARF1, ARF4 and ARF19) are implicated in leaf development, while ARF6 and ARF17 play a role in flowering.",

A consensus sequence, 5’-GGCCCA-3’, was returned as the top result of this query, with an E-value of 3.7E-12 ( Figure 3A ). There were 258 occurrences of this motif in 174 unique genes (15.6% of total input genes). Further, this motif predominantly occurred in the -100 to -0 bp region upstream of transcript initiation sites, as seen in the density analysis ( Figure 3B ). This motif, also known as ‘Up1’’(GGCCCAWWW) or ‘‘Site II element’’ (TGGGCY), is overrepresented in the -200 to -1 bp region of Arabidopsis transcripts. Additionally, this sequence has been identified as a binding site of the TB1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF (TCP) plant-specific family of transcription factors. Arabidopsis TCP proteins regulate many aspects of development including cell cycle control, leaf morphology, senescence as well as defense responses. Consistent with the enrichment of this element upstream of genes upregulated in µ g, a class I TCP (TCP22) was found to be upregulated in µ g ( Supplementary Table 3 ).",

            "text": "Perhaps the most striking aspect of the DEGs that are downregulated in both PS and PRR is that > 400 genes are associated with stress responses. This included a strong enrichment of biotic stress response (in particular, response to bacteria and chitin) and genes known to respond to many abiotic stresses, including salt and temperature. Curiously, these responses have been reported as upregulated in spaceflight experiments compared to ground controls. It is not surprising that the space environment poses several challenges to plants and many of these are not easy to measure or replicate on the ground. Although our focus in both PS and PRR spaceflights was the direct comparison of µ g with the onboard 1 g control, we also carried out ground controls where EMCS chamber conditions were matched in the ground reference module ERM-2. An examination of the DEGs between 1 g in space and ground controls revealed that many of these stress response-related genes were actually upregulated in 1 g compared to the ground. These observations indicate that the space environment (excluding µ g) enhanced the expression of these stress-related genes. However, this group of genes was specifically downregulated in µ g compared to 1 g suggesting that microgravity masks the induction of these genes in the space environment. Representative heat maps for select defense-related genes are shown in  Figure 5  ( Supplementary Table 7 ). As an example of an abiotic stress response, heat maps for a set of genes involved in salt stress are shown in  Figure 6  ( Supplementary Table 8 ). These heat maps clearly illustrate that the stress-related genes showed higher levels of expression in the spaceflight 1 g condition compared to either µ g or the ground controls. Since the 1 g and µ g experiments were conducted on two rotors held in the same chamber at the same time, we can be confident that all other “space-related” stimuli were shared between the two, and that the primary difference between them was the µ g treatment. The differences between 1 g and the ground control samples, would include all other effects of the space environment, excluding microgravity. It is clear that many of these genes would not have been detected as differentially expressed in the absence of the on board 1 g control and these results reveal that this control is critical in order to identify µ g specific changes.",

Even more pronounced is the similarity in enriched GO terms for genes downregulated in µ g and low g compared to 1 g and the genes downregulated in µ g in the PS/PRR data. These include, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus and response to stress. Genes downregulated in µ g in with the red light photostimulation were enriched in the GO categories response to bacterium and fungus.

We did not detect photosynthesis related genes upregulated in µ g in either PS or PRR, perhaps due to the differences in the lighting regime compared with the SG series of experiments. However, we do see enrichment for genes involved in photosynthesis and plastid function downregulated in µ g. Plastid localization was an enriched GO term for cellular localization accounting for approximately 300 genes in the µ g downregulated category of our dataset. Genes encoding for subunits of the NADPH complex, LHCA and photosystem I and II core were downregulated in µ g in both PS and PRR. We also found that several of the µ g downregulated miRNA targets were associated with plastids. Since many of these spaceflight studies have focused on young Arabidopsis seedlings, it is not clear if the altered regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function would persist in fully grown plants.

SGR5 was first described as being important for the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems. Further studies showed that SGR5 is localized in the shoot endodermis and that amyloplast sedimentation in the shoot endodermis is slower in the sgr5 mutant. SGR5 is also known as Indeterminate Domain 15 (IDD15). The IDD TFs IDD14, IDD15 and IDD16 have been shown to work cooperatively to regulate auxin transport in the shoot and play a role in aerial tissue development and gravitropic responses. We found IDD14 to be upregulated in µ g, as well as another gene involved in regulating gravitropic response – LAZY1. LAZY1 is expressed primarily in shoots of young seedlings and the early stages of the hypocotyl gravitropism were affected in a lazy1 mutant. The LAZY proteins are thought to act early in the gravity signaling cascade by transmitting positional information on amyloplast sedimentation upstream of auxin redistribution. The upregulation of these genes under µ g maybe related to their roles in regulating auxin flow; a closer look at their localization and dynamics under microgravity would be informative.",

            "text": "The PS and PRR experiments were focused on a narrow window of the Arabidopsis life cycle; the TROPI seed cassettes and EC arrangement only supported short duration experiments. Therefore we cannot extrapolate or assume that the transcriptional response to microgravity seen in these experiments would be universally applicable to long duration plant experiments on the ISS. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent spaceflight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plant development. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment.",

Although the replicates for each spaceflight were carried out back to back in the same hardware, and from the same flight builds, we detected run to run variation in responses. Run to run variation may be caused by other spaceflight related conditions that could differ on a day to day basis on the ISS. While this disparity did not overshadow the major transcriptional changes that were conserved between the PS and PRR experiments, it could be misleading if results from only a single experiment are considered. This underscores the importance of being able to conduct replicate spaceflight experiments.",

However, single-time-point transcriptional studies are valuable in that they can help identify key transcriptional regulators and they offer the first signs of pathways which may be altered. The inclusion of sRNA profiling in combination with RNA-Seq can provide clues on an additional layer of post transcriptional regulation and upcoming spaceflight experiments are likely to incorporate both these forms of analyses. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, spaceflight experiments frequently have insufficient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases. Only a few flight experiments to date, have taken a proteomic approach, and fewer still have been able to include both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Moving forward it will be important to employ multiple OMICs approaches to study a spaceflight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the ISS such as Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) can better support these endeavors. Ultimately, the biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment.",
