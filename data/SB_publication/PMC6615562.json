            "text": "Bone remodeling of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule is highly restricted and tightly controlled by the osteoprotegerin (OPG) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) / receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (RANK) system. In these bony structures, a pathological decrease in OPG expression stimulates osteoclast differentiation and excessive resorption followed by accrual of sclerotic bone, ultimately resulting in the development of otosclerosis, a leading cause of deafness in adults. Understanding the signaling pathways involved in maintaining OPG expression in the ear would shed light on the pathophysiology of otosclerosis and other ear bone-related diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that Ca2+ signaling through the L-type CaV1.2 Ca2+ channel positively regulates OPG expression and secretion in long bone osteoblasts and their precursor cells in vitro and in vivo. Whether CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression in ear bones has not been investigated. We drove expression of a gain-of-function CaV1.2 mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) using Col2a1-Cre, which we found to target osteochondral/osteoblast progenitors in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice displayed osteopetrosis of these bones shown by μCT 3D reconstruction, histological analysis, and lack of bone sculpting, findings similar to phenotypes seen in mice with an osteoclast defect. Consistent with those observations, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice showed reduced osteoclasts in the otic capsule, upregulated mRNA expression of Opg and Opg/Rankl ratio, and increased mRNA expression of osteoblast differentiation marker genes in the otic capsule, suggesting both an anti-catabolic and anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS mutant channel contributed to the observed morphological changes of the ear bones. Further, we found that Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice experienced hearing loss and displayed defects of body balance in behavior tests, confirming that the CaV1.2-dependent Ca2+ influx affects bone structure in the ear and consequent hearing and vestibular functions. Together, these data support our hypothesis that Ca2+ influx through CaV1.2TS promotes OPG expression from osteoblasts, thereby affecting bone modeling/remodeling in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule. These data provide insight into potential pathological mechanisms underlying perturbed OPG expression and otosclerosis.",

In the otic capsule, the vibrations are converted into electrical signals and transduced to the brain via auditory nerves.

            "text": "The auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, unlike most bones in the skull that form through intramembranous ossification, develop like long bones through endochondral ossification. In this process an initial cartilage template is subsequently replaced by bone while the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes and the calcified cartilage matrix are removed by osteoclasts (bone modeling phase). Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in mice with osteoclast defects results in osteopetrotic phenotype of these bones, significantly affecting their morphology and function. However, unlike long bones, no significant bone remodeling (a coupled process of osteoclastic bone resorption with subsequent osteoblastic formation) occurs in the auditory ossicles or the otic capsule after development. Turnover of the otic capsule in regions surrounding the perilymph spaces is about 0.13% per year compared to 10% for the long bones. This low bone remodeling rate in the otic capsule is due to high levels of secreted osteoprotegerin (OPG), a major negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and consequent bone resorption. By binding RANKL (receptor activator of NFκB ligand), OPG acts as a decoy receptor and prevents RANKL-RANK interactions and the downstream RANK-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation that is critical for initiation of osteoclast differentiation. In Opg−/− mice, massive erosion of auditory ossicles and the otic capsule by unchecked osteoclasts leads to compensatory abnormal osteogenesis, causing fixation of the stapes and consequent progressive hearing loss due.",

            "text": "In humans, reduced OPG in the otic capsule is associated with otosclerosis, a condition characterized by abnormal growth of bone at one or more foci within the middle ear or inner ear that often leads to hearing loss in patients. Otosclerosis develops initially through a first phase of bone resorption by activated osteoclasts and increased vascularization (the otospongiosis phase), followed by new bone deposition from osteoblasts and mineralization (the otosclerosis phase). The prevalence of otosclerosis is high in Caucasians compared to patients of African descent and higher in women than men. The etiology of otosclerosis is not well understood, but both genetic and environmental factors, including measles virus infection, hormonal changes during pregnancy and middle ear inflammation, have been postulated to contribute. Family linkage analyses and candidate gene association studies have identified several loci associated with otosclerosis, yet none of the otosclerosis causing genes within these regions has been identified so far. Nevertheless, mutations in SERPINF1 or MEPE have been recently associated with familial otosclerosis. Given that maintaining OPG level is fundamental to the prevention of bone turnover in the middle and inner ear and the consequent development of otosclerosis, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulates OPG expression will provide clues regarding the underlying biological basis of the disease.",

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrate a role for the L-type CaV1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) in the regulation of OPG expression in the middle and inner ear. The CaV1.2 channel is widely distributed and mediates Ca2+ influx into the cell upon membrane depolarization. The entry of Ca2+ causes a transient increase of intracellular [Ca2+]i, which serves as a second messenger and mediates critical physiological roles in many organs, including cardiac muscle contraction, hormone secretion in endocrine tissues, postsynaptic responses in various 5 neurons, and activation of gene expression paradigms. However, its role in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was not previously reported. The CaV1.2 channel is composed of multiple subunits: α1C, β, and α2δ. The α1C subunit is the ion-conducting pore while the β and α2δ are auxiliary subunits that modulate channel properties. Most studies focused on CaV1.2 function in excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and neurons, where frequent and dynamic changes in membrane potential facilitate activation of the voltage-gated channel, with little attention to potential contributions of the channel in non-excitable cells. Studies of Timothy syndrome (TS), a multiorgan disorder caused by de novo gain-of-function missense mutations in the α1C-encoding CACNA1C gene, revealed critical but previously unappreciated roles for CaV1.2 in many non-excitable cells. We and others demonstrated that CaV1.2 was expressed in osteoblast progenitors during long bone development and homeostasis. Moreover, in an in vitro MC3T3-E1 cell and a primary calvaria organ culture system, Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2 regulated OPG expression. Pharmacological blocking of CaV1.2 channel activity with nifedipine reduced the level of OPG expression and secretion. Consistent with those findings, we exploited the TS-causing mutant channel (CaV1.2TS) to increase Ca2+ signaling specifically in osteoblasts or their progenitors and observed inhibited osteoclast activity in long bones through upregulated OPG expression and secretion.",

Once a suitable plane of anesthesia was reached, the portion of the pinna which obscured the entrance to the tested ear canal was removed. The anesthetized animal was then placed in a sound-isolated, electrically-shielded box on top of a heating pad (40-90-2-05, FHC, Inc.). In conjunction with the heating pad, a rectal probe and DC temperature controller (41-90-8D, FHC, Inc.) were used to maintain the mouse’s temperature near 38 °C. Both eyes were moistened with ophthalmic ointment (Puralube®, Dechra Veterinary Products). Needle electrodes (GRD-SAF, The Electrode Store) were subdermally placed behind the pinna of the tested ear (reference electrode), in the scalp between the ears (active electrode), and in the back near the tail (ground electrode). ABRs were evoked by tone bursts of 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz produced by a closed-field magnetic speaker connected to a power amplifier (MF1 and SA1, Tucker-Davis Technologies). Each 5-ms burst was presented 33.3 times per second with alternating polarity. The onset and offset of each burst was tapered with a squared cosine function. For each frequency, the sound pressure level was lowered from 80 dB SPL in 5–10 dB steps until the threshold was reached. If 80 dB SPL was not enough to elicit a response, higher intensities were produced. The speaker’s output was transmitted into the ear through a custom acoustic coupler. The entire sound delivery system was calibrated with a ¼ inch condenser microphone (4939-A-011 and 2690-A-0S1, Brüel & Kjær). The electrical response evoked by the tone bursts and measured by the needle electrodes was amplified 10,000 times and bandpass filtered at 0.3–3 kHz (P55, Astro-Med Inc.). The amplified response was then digitally sampled at 10-μs intervals with a data acquisition device (PCI-6259, National Instruments) controlled by custom software (LabVIEW 2014, National Instruments). The electrical responses to 1,000 bursts were averaged at each intensity level to determine the threshold, which was defined as the lowest level at which any response peak was distinctly and reproducibly present. Visual inspection of the vertically stacked responses facilitated threshold determination.",

Mice at 6 weeks of age were singly placed in a 20 × 20 × 40 cm Plexiglas open field arena where activity was monitored by two rows of infrared diodes interfaced to a computer running Fusion 5.3 software. The activity of the animals in the open field were also recorded to digital video from a camera mounted over each test arena using Noldus Media Player (Noldus Information Technologies). The total distance (cm) moved and the circling activity as scored with Fusion software is reported. Circling is defined as the combination of clockwise and counter-clockwise circles performed by the mouse in the open field. In a separate test, balance and coordination were examined using a steady state rotarod at 25 rpm (Medd-Associates, St. Albans, VT). The steady speed was selected on a basis of an accelerated speed (4-40 rpm) given 24 hours prior to the steady speed test. This study showed that the average speed at which the mice fell from an accelerating rotarod was approximately 25 rpm. For the steady speed rotarod test, mice were given four 5-minute trials separated by a 20 min inter-trial interval (ITI). In all cases, trials terminated when the mouse fell from the rod or at 300 seconds. This time (s) was recorded as the latency to fall from the rod.",

We employed a CaV1.2TS transgenic mouse model, in which CaV1.2TS expression was silenced by a floxed upstream stop codon. We activated CaV1.2TS mutant channel expression in the bones of ear with Col2a1-Cre, which targets the osteochondral progenitors. Targeted Col2a1-Cre expression in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule was confirmed with Col2a1-Cre;Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice (Fig. 1). The Col2a1-Cre directed lacZ expression in the ossicles and otic capsule, detected by prominent β-galactosidase staining that was absent in Rosa26-lacZ reporter mice lacking the Col2a1-Cre. We then examined the morphology of the isolated auditory ossicles and the otic capsule from Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their Cre-negative littermate controls at 6 weeks of age. We found that the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice were thicker and had more bone mass than those of the control mice, particularly at the malleus handle, the malleus bony membrane, the incus body, the footplate of stapes, the stapedial arch (especially the anterior and posterior crura), and the whole otic capsule (Fig. 2A–D). In Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice, narrowed spaces were observed between the stapedial crura (through which the stapedial artery passes), for the round window and the oval window of the otic capsule. μCT 3-D reconstruction images of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsules confirmed the thicken bones and massive increase of bone mass in the malleus, incus, stapes and the otic capsules of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice as well as the narrowed cavities for the stapedial artery and the cochlea (Fig. 2E–H).",

We also observed extensive Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant in the bones of the mutant mice besides the Alcian Blue-stained cartilage remnant of the globuli interossei in the cochlea, suggesting osteoclast defects in the mutant mice.

We performed tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining on histological sections of the otic capsules Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and littermate controls at 2 weeks of age. Compared to the controls, we observed significantly less TRAP-staining and fewer osteoclasts in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4A–F). We next quantitated the number of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts and osteoclast area, both of which were normalized to the bone area. The number of osteoclasts per bone area (Oc.N/B.Ar) was decreased by 91% and osteoclast area per bone area (Oc.Ar/B/Ar) decreased by 79% in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4G), suggesting that osteoblastic bone resorption of the otic capsule is greatly reduced in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice during postnatal development. As Col2a1-Cre expression is restricted to osteochondral lineage but not to osteoclast progenitors, increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS mutant channel could inhibit osteoclastogenesis via interfering with the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in the otic capsule, similar to that we observed in the long bone. We therefore examined Opg and Rankl mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice and their littermate controls. Indeed, RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated (~4.4 fold) Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared with that in the control mice but no significant change in Rankl mRNA expression, thus resulting in an increase (~2.6 fold) in Opg/Rankl mRNA expression ratio in the otic capsule (Fig. 4H). We also detected upregulated mRNA expression of genes for osteoblast differentiation, such as Alpl, Runx2 and Sp7 in the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice (Fig. 4I), suggesting an anabolic effect of CaV1.2TS also contributed the increased bone mass in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule of Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice.",

Representative responses from control (Fig. 5A) and CaV1.2TS-expressing mutant mice (Fig. 5B) to decreasing stimulus intensities at 8 kHz showed differences in sensitivity and latency between the two genotypes. Compared to the control mice, the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice had no response to intensities below 85 dB SPL at 8 kHz and below 75 dB at 16 kHz (Fig. 5C and 5D). The mutant mice also showed delays for even stronger stimulus intensities (Fig. 5C and 5D). Furthermore, the hearing threshold of the Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice was significantly higher (lower sensitivity) than that of the control mice in the 4 to 16 kHz region, while we found no significant difference in threshold between two genotypes at 32 kHz (Fig. 5E).

Additionally, we found that the CaV1.2TS-expressing mice exhibited frequent and random circling behavior in both the clockwise and counter clockwise directions (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Video), which lasted up to 8 seconds, indicating defects in vestibular function. We also evaluated body balance and coordination with the rotarod test. When accelerating the rotarod from 4 to 40 rpm, the Col2aCre-CaV1.2TS mutant mice fell off earlier, at an average speed of 25 rpm (Fig. 6B), and showed a significant decrease in the latency to fall (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, on the steady state rotarod at 25 rpm, the latency to fall was decreased across all four trials for Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mutant mice compared to that for the controls (Fig. 6D).

Absence of osteoclastic bone resorption in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op mice significantly affected these bones morphologically and functionally. Expression of the gain-of-function CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice affected the overall morphology of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule, which display reduced sculpting (see the stapedial crura) and an osteopetrotic phenotype that are strikingly similar to those seen in Rankl−/−, Fos−/− and Csf1op/op osteoclastic defect mice, suggesting that the anticatabolic effect of increased Ca2+ signaling through CaV1.2TS contributed to the morphological changes in theses bones. While this is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, showing that modulating Ca2+ signal via CaV1.2 in the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule regulates osteoclastogenesis and bone modeling/remodeling in the middle and inner ear, our data are consistent with previous observations from others and us that CaV1.2 regulates OPG expression and secretion from osteoblasts. That expression of the CaV1.2TS mutant channel in our model was driven by Col2a1-Cre, which restricts expression to chondrocytes and osteoblast precursors but not in osteoclasts or their progenitors, adds further support to our hypothesis that the anticatabolic responses by altered CaV1.2 activity is mediated by upregulated OPG expression and secretion in bones of the ear. Our data showing increased Opg mRNA expression in the otic capsule surrounding the cochlea in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice further supports this hypothesis.",

Consistent with that hypothesis, the organ of Corti is grossly intact in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice (Fig. 4). However, as aberrant bone remodeling progresses in Col2a1-Cre;CaV1.2TS mice, it is also possible that the increased bone formation of the auditory ossicles and the otic capsule and narrowed cavities in the bony labyrinth of the otic capsule could impair neuronal function and contribute to the circling behavior and hearing impairment.

Although this correlation has not been consistently observed, and the underlying mechanism of effect of fluoride on otosclerosis has not been sufficiently established, it is intriguing that fluoride, which plays an important role in both bone formation and homeostasis of bone mineral metabolism, has been shown to affect Ca2+ homeostasis in many types of cells such as in proximal tubules, fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, as well as osteoblasts. Further, expression of CaV1.2 was stimulated by low-dose fluoride, inhibited by high-dose fluoride, and fluoride can stimulate cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel activity by increasing channel open probability or the duration of channel opening in a dose-dependent manner. Our finding of upregulated OPG mRNA expression and OPG mediated-osteoclastogenesis inhibition in the otic capsule upon increased Ca2+ signaling via CaV1.2 may add a new dimension to the effectiveness of sodium fluoride treating patients with osteosclerosis.",
