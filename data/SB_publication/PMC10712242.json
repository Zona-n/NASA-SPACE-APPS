            "text": "Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis’ molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.",

            "text": "Numerous plant spaceflight studies have long focused on unraveling the complex physiological changes plants undergo in the spaceflight environment. In their diversity, these studies have accumulated an extensive array of phenotypic characterizations and uncovered some of the fundamental concepts related to physiological adaptation in space. However, the traditional approaches have recently been complemented and in many ways superseded by the advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods, setting the stage for high throughput analyses that investigates the effects of spaceflight on plants from a molecular and functional perspective. This allows the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment to be characterized beyond phenotyping and extensively mapped out along broader biochemical pathways and cryptic signaling molecular cascades. While some remarkable advancements in genomic and transcriptomics studies of plants in spaceflight have been widely recorded, such studies have largely been conducted in isolation, independent of proteomics. Unlike genomic and transcriptomic studies, proteomics studies face certain limitations in the spaceflight context, predominantly due to the limited availability of plant tissues for analysis. As a result, comprehensive spaceflight proteomics studies conducted on the whole Arabidopsis plant have been relatively few, with only three reported so far.",

Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight.

            "text": "Studying plants’ adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand. One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister – Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source, with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues. Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity and other environmental stresses. Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth.",

Approximately 30 seeds were plated on each 60mm round petri plate containing 6.7ml of 0.5× + Benomyl Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth media with Gamborg’s B5 vitamins, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.75% (w/v) phytagel, and cold stratified for 16h. Seeded plates were loaded in a horizontal orientation, with the face of the growth media parallel to the ground in the BRIC LED hardware petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each hardware canister holds 6 PDFUs, with each PDFU holding a 60mm petri plate. This configuration was replicated 6 times, making a total of 36 seeded 60mm plates loaded aboard ISS. All BRICs were kept in cold storage (4°C) prior to the spaceflight launch. The experiment was flown on the SpaceX CRS-13 mission launched aboard the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket on December 15, 2017. The dormant Arabidopsis seeds were activated with light and placed at ambient temperature aboard the ISS, with a light wavelength composition of 85% red, 15% blue, and 60 µmol m−2 s−1 intensity. The plants were grown for 10 days with a 4-hour/2-hour light-dark cycle, prior to actuation of the PDFUs, releasing about 6–7ml RNAlater into the petri plates for seedling fixation. The seedlings were then incubated in Invitrogen RNAlater for 12 hours after which they were frozen aboard the ISS MELFI at −80°C until returned to Earth on May 5, 2018, aboard the SpaceX CRS-14 cargo dragon. A similar experimental setup was established on the ground, for same duration, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber, USA. The samples were transported on dry ice from the dragon capsule to the receiving laboratories. Frozen plates containing both the spaceflight and ground samples were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University where they were stored at −80°C prior to protein extraction and processing while another group was also sent to the University of Florida, Gainesville for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing.",

Of this, 195 RNA are upregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≥1, while 761 are downregulated in spaceflight at L2FCRNA≤−1 ( Figure 1A ). Protein extraction from the different organs (root and shoot) and across the cellular fractions (soluble and membrane) led to the quantification, in the root, of 20,923 peptides mapped to 3973 membrane proteins and 18,636 peptides mapped to 3412 soluble proteins. Similar to this, in the shoot, 20,658 peptides were mapped to 3965 membrane proteins and 20,091 peptides were mapped to 3537 soluble proteins. Only proteins with a FDR of 0.01 and a minimum of two uniquely mapped non-nested peptides (amino acid length >6 were retained. Proteins with B–H adjusted p≤0.05 were identified as statistically significant in the dataset. A total of 2187 membrane proteins and 332 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the root, while 1856 membrane proteins and 476 soluble proteins were statistically significant in the shoot. At the decision thresholds of L2FCprotein≥0.2 and L2FCprotein≤−0.2, 821 membrane proteins and 135 soluble proteins in the root were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 1199 membrane proteins and 162 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1A ).

Applying the widely accepted threshold for RNA tier II analysis, L2FCRNA≥1 or L2FCRNA≤−1, reduces false positives in interpreting the biological significance of the differentially expressed transcripts. However, this also led to the exclusion of over 61% of our total statistically significant transcripts ( Figure 1B ), with the possibility of the exclusion of some transcripts with biological significance. Membrane proteins were more differentially abundant (p<0.05) and highly perturbed in spaceflight compared to the soluble proteins.

This study further provides insight into how the specific plant organs (root and shoot) respond to microgravity in spaceflight. The organ-targeted proteomic profiling in response to microgravity, in this study, revealed that roots and shoots adapt differently to the spaceflight environment, and at the same time, they share certain commonalities. Comparing root-specific protein abundance in spaceflight to Earth, 400 membrane proteins and 75 soluble proteins were more abundant in space, whereas 606 membrane proteins and 71 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). For proteins specific to the shoot, 357 membrane, and 112 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight, whereas 438 membrane and 179 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight ( Figure 1C ). Common to both root and shoot, 421 membrane proteins and 60 soluble proteins were more abundant in spaceflight compared to on Earth. Likewise, the abundance of 593 membrane proteins and 91 soluble proteins was reduced in spaceflight across both organs. Interestingly, a comparison of the differentially abundant proteins shared by both organs revealed that 18 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot, while 34 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the shoot and less abundant in the root ( Figure 1C ,  Table 1 ). A GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the 34 membrane proteins with increased abundance in the shoot and decreased abundance in the root in spaceflight revealed that they were majorly involved in the photosynthetic pathway, carbon metabolism pathway, and amide biosynthetic process. Likewise, these proteins were majorly chloroplast localized and are enriched for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) phosphorylating activity, poly(U) RNA binding, and oxidoreductase activity ( Supplementary Figure 1 ). KEGG pathway analysis of the 18 membrane proteins that were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot did not indicate their involvements in a major metabolic pathway. However, some of these proteins were the heat shock proteins (HSP70, HSP90.4), host defense proteins such as the Importin (IMPA-4) and Pectinesterase inhibitor 17 (PME17), proteins involved in shunt energy processes such as the Transketolase (TLK2) and Electron Transfer flavoprotein (ETFQ).

Transcripts are targeted toward different subcellular organelles in the plant cell based on the specific functions of encoded proteins. Assessing which of the targeted organelles have the highest amount of perturbed proteins gives insight into the metabolic process most affected by the spaceflight environment. Our expectation is that since transcripts encode proteins that are targeted toward different organelles, the pattern of subcellular localization of the RNA transcripts differentially expressed should be similar to that of proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight. To ascertain this, we compared transcripts and proteins with differential abundance in our spaceflight experiments against SUBA4, and results were subsequently fed into SUBAcon to recover more accurate proteome-wide subcellular localizations.",

KEGG pathway analysis of the nucleus-targeted transcripts upregulated in spaceflight indicated that they are majorly involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways which are tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism ( Supplementary Figure 2A ). Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins downregulated in spaceflight are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome pathway, with many being part of the ubiquitin ligase complex and the ER-associated degradation complex (ERAD) ( Supplementary Figure 2B ). Another interesting group of transcripts are those encoding proteins targeted towards extracellular matrix, being 20% of the total upregulated RNA and 11.1% of the total downregulated RNA. Upregulated transcripts encoding extracellular-matrix targeted proteins are enriched in cell wall biogenesis, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, and flavonoid metabolic process, while the downregulated ones are uniquely enriched in pathways involved in response to salicylic acid, polysaccharide biosynthetic process, response to brassinosteroid and cell wall organization ( Figure 2B ). The metabolic pathways enriched were significantly different in the extracellular protein dataset in comparison with the RNA transcriptome ( Figure 2B ).",

Enrichment analysis of root plastid localized proteins that were differentially abundant in spaceflight indicated that proteins involved in plastid movements, organization of plastid membranes, and light harvesting were less abundant in spaceflight than on earth, while those involved in valine biosynthetic pathways, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and the dark reaction of photosynthesis were more abundant in spaceflight. The valine biosynthetic pathway is intertwined with the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, and they both inhibit the growth of shoots and increase root formation. Notably, 154 membrane and 51 soluble extracellular localized proteins were abundant in spaceflight in the root and they are majorly involved in glycan degradation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pentose-glucuronate interconversion. This is indicative of increased restructuring of the root cell wall polysaccharides in spaceflight.",

Contrary to the root, 83 membrane and 63 soluble extracellular proteins were more abundant in spaceflight and they are highly enriched in pathways for cellular oxidation regulation and negative regulation of peptidase activities. Extracellular proteins less abundant in spaceflight are enriched in pathways responsible for plant defense. An interesting observation as regards the comparative subcellular localization of transcriptome and root and shoot proteome in spaceflight is that most downregulated RNA in spaceflight encode proteins targeted back to the nucleus whereas most downregulated proteins in spaceflight are plastids localized.

Enriched among the downregulated RNA and proteins are those involved in translation, amide biosynthetic process, mitochondrial and peroxisome fission ( Figure 3A ).

            "text": "RNA transcripts and proteins involved in the intracellular transportation of lipids were more enriched and abundant in spaceflight than on Earth ( Figure 5 ). GLYCOLIPID TRANSFER PROTEIN (GTP, L2FCRoot=0.32) and ACCELERATED CELL DEATH 11 (ACD11, L2FCShoot=0.32), involved in sphingolipid transport were abundant in spaceflight in both root and shoot respectively. The abundance of NON-SPECIFIC LIPID-TRANSFER PROTEINS (LTP1, LTP5, LTPG31) and PROTEIN FATTY ACID EXPORT 3 (FAX3, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.32, 0.66) in spaceflight suggests the use of long-distance systemic signaling in space and the formation of lipid polymer barriers. The PHOSPHOLIPID-TRANSPORTING ATPASE 10 (ALA10, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.69, 0.55), a lipid flippase, was abundant in spaceflight. ALA10 is involved in the desaturation process of phosphatidylcholine, a lipid abundant during phosphate starvation and in the regulation of auxin polar transport. The abundance of PATELLINs (PATL2, PATL4, PATL6), regulators of auxin-mediated PIN1 relocation, and AUXIN EFFLUX CARRIERS 3 (PIN3, L2FCRoot=0.49) in spaceflight and the decrease in abundance of the PIN4 (L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.46, −0.75), PIN7(L2FC Root/Shoot=−0.27, −0.84), AUXIN RESPONSE 4 (AXR4, L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.34, −0.47), AUXIN TRANSPORTER PROTEIN1 (LAX1, L2FCShoot=−0.74), ABCB1 (L2FCShoot=−0.21) and ABCB20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=−0.35, −0.65) suggests an alteration in polar auxin redistribution in plants grown in spaceflight ( Figure 5B ). The MYOSINs (XIB, ATM1, XI-H, XI-K, MYA2), which are motor proteins that drive movement along the actin filaments were not significantly abundant (p<0.05) in the shoot in spaceflight but were significantly less abundant in the root. The expression of auxin transporters was organ-specific and this suggested that the distribution of auxin is altered differently in the root and shoot for adaptation to the space environment ( Supplementary Table A ).",

Common to both organs and more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth are Endoglucanase 20 (L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.86, 1.13), involved in the degradation of cellulose to its monomeric subunit, FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs (FLA 7, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.51, 1.43, and FLA 9, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.73, 0.53) and PLASMA MEMBRANE-ASSOCIATED CATION-BINDING PROTEINs (PCAP1, L2FCRoot, Shoot=0.49, 0.52 and PCAP2, L2FCRoot, Shoot=1.08, 1.47) which are have been implicated in microtubule destabilization and identified as possible regulators of phosphatidylinositol phosphates membrane reformations during intracellular signaling ( Table 2 ). VILLINs (VLN2, VLN3, VLN4), proteins involved in the bundling, severing, nucleating, and capping of the actin cytoskeleton, were also more abundant in spaceflight than on Earth, in both organs ( Table 2 ).

Over 132 RNA transcripts and 241 proteins involved in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis and ROS signaling were significantly altered (p<0.05) in spaceflight ( Figure 6 ,  Supplementary Table C ). While the RNA transcripts included only a few of the traditionally known ROS and ROS-associated genes such as peroxidases, -redoxins, dehydrogenases, and so on, the proteome had many of them. The RNA transcripts involved in the response to ROS pathway differentially expressed in spaceflight include heat shock proteins (HSPs), transcription factors, and ubiquitin ligases ( Figure 6 ). In both organs, 18 of the 20 PEROXIDASE proteins were abundant in spaceflight, indicating a high rate of ROS generation through the reduction of peroxide.

The BRIC LED hardware, with integrated LED illumination, provides the growing seedlings with a source of light. Hence, plants growing in the BRIC LED hardware on ISS will have light cues but lack gravitational cues. This enabled us to study the effects of microgravity on plant transcriptome and organ-specific proteome, while also providing insight into how the plant root and shoot individually integrate light signaling in the absence of gravity. Evidence from this study suggests that the operations of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) were greatly impacted in spaceflight ( Figure 4 ), with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. While the net photosynthetic rate might not be affected in microgravity as it was not captured in this study, the molecular functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, as revealed by this study, were impacted. The abundance of the NusG-like proteins (PTAC12, PTAC14, PTAC3, PTAC4) in the shoot and NusG-like proteins (PTAC16, PTAC14) in the root ( Supplementary Table D ) suggests attempts at boosting the translational efficiency of chloroplast ribosomes to reduce the plant sensitivity to environmental stress in spaceflight. The abundance of D1 complex protein (PSBA) and the PPL1 in spaceflight suggests attempts to optimize the water-oxidizing reaction and repair damages to the PSII. Reduced abundance of the PSAB and PSAE isoforms of the PSI in spaceflight, signifies an increased susceptibility of the PSII to photoinhibition and a deficiency of the PSI steady state redox-level and re-oxidation. The PPL1, which was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, works to facilitate the assembly of PSII and optimize plant fitness under increased sensitivity to the BRIC LED hardware light.",

The reduced abundance of PSII proximal antennae protein cp43 (PSBC) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes (LHCB1, LHCB4, LHCB5, LHCB6) in spaceflight suggest an attempt to decrease light harvest by the photosystems, hence decrease photoinhibition, increase the oxygen-evolving capability and improve repair to PSII. Varying degrees of molecular perturbations to the plant photosystem complexes in spaceflight have earlier been reported, which further validate our findings. However, unlike in this current study, where PSII and PSI complexes transcripts (RNA) were upregulated in spaceflight, reported significant downregulation of transcripts enriched in photosynthetic pathways in spaceflight compared to ground samples. They also indicated the downregulation of four RNA transcripts associated with photosynthetic electron transport (petE: plastocyanin, petF: ferredoxin, petH: ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, petJ: cytochrome c6). These transcripts were however upregulated in spaceflight in our current study, but they were all downregulated at the proteome level in both the plant root and shoot ( Figure 4 ). These discrepancies at the transcript level may be due to the difference in Arabidopsis wildtype ecotypes and spaceflight hardware utilized in both experiments. While utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Landsberg and the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) hardware, this study utilized the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia-0 and the BRIC LED hardware. and emphasize that the choice of hardware is a significant source of variations in the results of plant spaceflight experiments transcriptomics and proteomics.",

Of course, study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient.

Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication.

This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments.

Our results suggest dedicated efforts to the removal of superoxide radicals by the abundance of several peroxides, thioredoxin, ferritin, and superoxide dismutase in spaceflight. We infer that plants in spaceflight utilize a shunt pathway, which is a parallel alternative to the glycolytic pathway, to complement the NADPH production from the pentose-phosphate pathway. The pentose-phosphate shunt pathway is driven by NADPH demands in different tissues, and in this extremity, plants in spaceflight recycle inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolites in the vacuole, mediated by PAP26 to meet the NADPH demands. This suggests that the metabolic energy requirement for plants in space is higher than on Earth. The abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and several glutathione dehydrogenases suggests the involvement of the S-nitrosation reaction in cellular homeostasis in spaceflight.

            "text": "While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight. Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated by. Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there’s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions.",

Our analysis of Arabidopsis plants grown in space reveals that the expression of RNA transcripts did not correspond to their translation to shoot and root proteins. The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation. Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities. Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant’s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants’ transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias.",

While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant’s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity.",
