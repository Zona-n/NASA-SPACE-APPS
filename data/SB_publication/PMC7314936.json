            "text": "The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest research plant growth facility deployed on the International Space Station (ISS). APH is a fully enclosed, closed-loop plant life support system with an environmentally controlled growth chamber designed for conducting both fundamental and applied plant research during experiments extending as long as 135 days. APH was delivered to the ISS in parts aboard two commercial resupply missions: OA-7 in April 2017 and SpaceX-11 in June 2017, and was assembled and installed in the Japanese Experiment Module Kibo in November 2018. We report here on a 7-week-long hardware validation test that utilized a root module planted with both Arabidopsis (cv. Col 0) and wheat (cv. Apogee) plants. The validation test examined the APH’s ability to control light intensity, spectral quality, humidity, CO2 concentration, photoperiod, temperature, and root zone moisture using commanding from ground facilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The test also demonstrated the execution of programmed experiment profiles that scheduled: (1) changes in environmental combinations (e.g., a daily photoperiod at constant relative humidity), (2) predetermined photographic events using the three APH cameras [overhead, sideview, and sideview near-infrared (NIR)], and (3) execution of experimental sequences during the life cycle of a crop (e.g., measure photosynthetic CO2 drawdown experiments). Arabidopsis and wheat were grown in microgravity to demonstrate crew procedures, planting protocols and watering schemes within APH. The ability of APH to contain plant debris was assessed during the harvest of mature Arabidopsis plants. Wheat provided a large evaporative load that tested root zone moisture control and the recovery of transpired water by condensation. The wheat canopy was also used to validate the ability of APH to measure gas exchange of plants from non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., canopy photosynthesis and respiration). These features were evaluated by executing experiment profiles that utilized the CO2 drawdown technique to measure daily rates of canopy photosynthesis and dark-period CO2 increase for respiration. This hardware validation test confirmed that APH can measure fundamental plant responses to spaceflight conditions.",

            "text": "Spaceflight plant research is conducted in plant chambers designed to operate in reduced gravity. Previous spaceflight experiments found that indirect effects of microgravity reduce plant growth in space. These indirect effects include: (1) altered behavior of liquids and gases affecting fluid behavior phenomena, (2) capillary-driven moisture redistribution resulting in poor root-zone aeration, and (3) the absence of buoyancy-driven convection causing poor mass and heat transfer to leaves and plant organs. Other considerations include the limited availability of resources in spacecraft (i.e., mass, power and volume) for plant chambers. As a result, plant growth systems for conducting spaceflight experiments [e.g., Advanced Astroculture (ADVASC) and the Biomass Production System (BPS)] were designed to mitigate these secondary effects of the spaceflight environment using forced convection and actively watered root modules that provide well-aerated root zones. However, these systems were limited by small growth areas available for crop production. Larger plant growth systems are required to overcome the remaining challenges in spaceflight plant research. These challenges are to develop and demonstrate the performance of substrate-free, gravity-independent, water delivery systems to safely grow salad crops in reduced gravity environments for supplementing crew diets.",

These facilities have larger plant growth areas (∼0.2 m2) and volumes than previous platforms, and are designed for studying crop production, plant-to-plant interactions, and human-plant-microbial ecosystems using large plants in space. Veggie uses LED lights, a passive watering system and minimal environmental control consisting of a fan to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. Recently, the Veggie was used to grow nutritious lettuce crops that are safe to eat on ISS. In contrast, the APH facility is a research, plant growth chamber that can grow plants under complete environmental control (i.e., spectral quality, light intensity, temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and ethylene concentration) for life cycles as long as 135 days. It incorporates a root module watering design that is similar to those developed for ADVASC and BPS: a substrate-based water delivery system that actively controls matric potential of the root zone.",

The APH measures CO2 and water vapor fluxes using non-destructive gas exchange techniques demonstrated on the BPS, a predecessor to the APH with an identical CO2 control architecture. During the ISS Expedition 4 in 2002, the BPS was used to measure the photosynthetic canopy quantum yield (CQY), the conversion of absorbed radiation into gross CO2 fixation, of wheat plant stands in microgravity using the CO2 drawdown technique. In that study, the canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY of 21-day-old wheat in microgravity did not differ from 1g controls at moderate light intensities. The APH was designed to also measure canopy photosynthetic rates and CQY during spaceflight, however, at higher light intensities than previously available in the BPS. The APH provides lighting with a wide range in spectral quality and a maximum photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 1,000 μmol m–2 s–1, which is nearly three times higher than was possible in the BPS.",

Furthermore, there was no crew time allotted for thinning plants, and there were no provisions to bring back harvested plant samples for analysis on the ground. Instead, non-destructive and non-invasive gas exchange measurements (i.e., photosynthesis and respiration) of an Arabidopsis/wheat canopy were recorded daily. Thus, healthy plant growth was ascertained by comparing images and gas exchange data collected during the life cycle of the plants with known values reported in the literature. The photosynthetic responses of an Arabidopsis/wheat canopy to light and CO2 concentration were measured in microgravity, and compared to literature values from previous studies with wheat conducted at 1g and during spaceflight.",

The experiment profiles were also used for conducting pre-programmed CO2 drawdown experiments to collect non-destructive gas exchange data. The data collected included GC and SC environmental parameters, daily overhead and sideview images, and daily measurements of photosynthesis and respiration. In addition, the experiment profiles controlled the photoperiod in the GC and the media moisture content in each SC quadrant. The drawdown experiment generated plant response curves to altered CO2 concentrations and light intensities. Thus, a major portion of the science capabilities of APH were verified during the first plant test.",

The system for controlling the CO2 concentration of the APH GC provides a means to measure canopy photosynthesis non-destructively using gas exchange techniques pioneered by ecophysiologists in the 1960s. Plants remove CO2 from the chamber atmosphere via photosynthesis when illuminated and add CO2 via respiration in the dark. The APH utilizes a semi-closed gas exchange system to maintain chamber CO2 setpoint, and acts like a closed system when CO2 control is disabled. In the semi-closed system, the chamber CO2 setpoint during the photoperiod is maintained by injecting small, known volumes of CO2 into the chamber and the photosynthetic rate is determined from the number of CO2 pulses injected over a given time period, but chamber leak rate must be known. At night, CO2 control is disabled and CO2 concentration rises due to dark respiration to a level higher than the daytime setpoint. At the start of the photoperiod when CO2 control and ethylene scrubbing are disabled, the chamber operates in closed mode and photosynthesis draws down the chamber CO2 concentration down to the daytime setpoint. This daily CO2 drawdown was used to measure photosynthetic rates during the development of the plant canopy growing in the APH.",

The germination rate of the Arabidopsis plant growth test was only 58%, which was significantly lower than the 80% germination rate observed in early germination tests on the ground. The germination rate reported is really a survival rate because germinating Arabidopsis plants are small and cannot be distinguished from background by the overhead camera. A greater number of plants may have actually germinated, but two reasons contributed to poor survival. Typically five plants are seeded per position, but only two were planted in this validation test to prevent overcrowding because crew time for thinning was not available. Poor survival was also observed due to uneven water distribution during priming of the SC and/or overwatering caused by microgravity-induced moisture redistribution phenomena during the early growth phases. These results were later addressed by the PH-01 research team during the implementation of their spaceflight experiment.",

The CO2 control system operates the GC as a closed gas exchange system to determine: (1) daily canopy photosynthetic rates, and (2) response curves of photosynthesis to chamber CO2 concentration and to light intensity. During a CO2 drawdown curve, chamber CO2 is raised to 2,000 μmol mol–1, the plants are allowed to acclimate at the desired light level for ∼1 h, then chamber CO2 and ethylene control are disabled and a photosynthetic CO2 drawdown occurs. Ethylene control must be disabled because the permanganate-filled Purafil SP beads used to control ethylene absorb significant amounts of CO2 (Purafil, Inc., Doraville, GA, United States). Net photosynthetic carbon uptake consumes CO2 and chamber CO2 is reduced at a rate that is proportional to the incident light level. The change in CO2 concentration between 2,000 to 1500 μmol mol–1 is used to calculate canopy photosynthesis at a saturating CO2 concentration. For a CO2 drawdown experiment, repeating drawdown curves are conducted at descending light levels ending in a measurement of dark respiration.",

During the 4 h dark period, CO2 control was disabled for 2 h, allowing CO2 concentration to rise rapidly above 2,000 μmol mol–1. The initial rise in CO2 concentration vs. time during this period provided a measure of canopy dark respiration rate (Figure 5, APH Rdark, blue circles). During the remaining 2 h of darkness, CO2 control was enabled at a setpoint of 1700 μmol mol–1. When the lights came on, CO2 control and ethylene scrubbing were disabled to initiate the drawdown curve. After 1 h, CO2 and ethylene control were enabled to re-establish a setpoint of 1500 μmol mol–1. The decrease in CO2 concentration vs. time during the drawdown period is a measure of maximal canopy net photosynthetic rate (Figure 5, APH Pnet, open circles). A 1 h limit for the daily CO2 drawdown was used because at high light the canopy can deplete CO2 rapidly, and it is imperative to prevent chamber CO2 concentration from dropping below the CO2 compensation point (∼100 μmol mol–1), which may cause photooxidative damage to the plants.",

From 15 to 29 DAP, the daily Pnet matches the photosynthetic rates of wheat grown at 500 μmol m–2 s–1 (Figure 5; Wheeler 1996, red triangles). After 15 DAP, daily Pnet remains higher than was observed in the BPS. Photosynthesis in BPS was constant from 15 to 21 DAP because the wheat flag leaves were larger than the height of the BPS chamber, which caused the upper leaves to fold over each other resulting in self-shading (Figure 5, inset 21 DAP BPS), thus preventing higher penetration of light into the canopy. In contrast wheat grown in APH allowed more light to penetrate into the canopy (Figure 5, inset 26 DAP APH), thus Pnet increases with age at a rate similar to that reported by. After 26 DAP, daily Pnet was lower because the photosynthetic contribution from Arabidopsis was removed. These observations suggest that the wheat/Arabidopsis canopy grown during the first plant test of the APH had similar gas exchange rates as wheat plants grown on the ground.",

The resulting response curves of canopy photosynthesis to CO2 concentration for the four highest light levels are shown in Figure 7. The response curves measured during the first and second days are shown as solid and dashed lines, respectively.

Another source of error in CQY is introduced from inclusion of the two partial drawdown curves because the photosynthetic rates obtained from those drawdown curves were not measured at the desired 1700 μmol mol–1 CO2 setpoints (Figure 6B).

The hardware validation test verified that all subsystems of the APH were fully operational after it was assembled in the Kibo module. The first plant test demonstrated how two plant species requiring different optimum environmental conditions and with vastly different growth rates can be accommodated in the APH. Although there was minimal crew time for tending the plants, and no provisions for bringing plant samples for further analysis on the ground, the APH was able to measure plant responses to CO2 concentration and to light levels using non-destructive gas exchange techniques. The growth of the plants was accomplished via teleoperated commanding from the EMA at KSC, and the pre-programmed CO2 drawdown experiments were conducted using experiment profiles that controlled the setpoints required for measuring these responses. Admittedly, the gas exchange data collected during the first plant test was not repeated on the ground, thus it cannot be used to make any conclusions regarding plant growth in space. However, this effort demonstrated that the APH has expanded the capabilities of spaceflight plant growth chambers both in the size of the growth area, the higher light intensities and increased spectral combinations possible, as well as in their ability to collect non-destructive data sets (i.e., images and gas exchange rates) that can be used to measure plant growth during spaceflight. These capabilities will undoubtedly expand our knowledge of plant growth during spaceflight, which is needed for supporting the sustainable and long-term human colonization of space.",
