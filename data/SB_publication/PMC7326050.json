The analysis revealed enhanced production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones and therapeutically relevant SMs, including bicoumanigrin A, aurasperones A and B, and the antioxidant pyranonigrin A. Genetic variants that may be responsible for increased SM production levels in JSC-093350089 were identified. These findings include INDELs within the predicted promoter region of flbA, which encodes a developmental regulator that modulates pyranonigrin A production via regulation of Fum21. The pyranonigrin A biosynthetic gene cluster was confirmed in A. niger, which revealed the involvement of a previously undescribed gene, pyrE, in its biosynthesis. UVC sensitivity assays enabled characterization of pyranonigrin A as a UV resistance agent in the ISS isolate.",

            "text": "Filamentous fungi are ubiquitous in spacecraft environments due to anthropogenic contamination and an inability to completely sterilize the craft and cargo. Microbial infections are a major health risk for astronauts, and are exacerbated by the combined stresses of microgravity, sleep disruption, alterations in food intake, confined living space, and high levels of radiation that can compromise the immune system. Additionally, several studies have indicated that spacecraft environments increase microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance. As we make strides toward human interplanetary exploration, investigations into the characteristics of filamentous fungi that reside in spacecraft environments are critical for crew health. Additionally, such studies present diverse industrial and therapeutic opportunities, as fungi produce a plethora of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to external stressors. These small molecules often kill or inhibit growth of other organisms, enabling fungi to successfully compete within the complex ecosystem they reside in. While some SMs are toxic to humans, others have diverse industrial and therapeutic applications, including antibiotic, anticancer, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and cholesterol-lowering activities. The remarkable structural and functional diversity of fungal SMs arise from the combinatorial and modular nature of their biosynthesis, in which the SM core backbone is biosynthesized by a core synthase enzyme, such as a polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), or a hybrid PKS-NRPS, and further diversified by a number of tailoring enzymes that are clustered together within the genome.",

The filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger has been reported to be a predominant ISS isolate, and is frequently detected in other built environments. A. niger is a melanized fungal species commonly used in the biotech industry as a production host for citric acid and enzymes. Melanized fungi are commonly isolated from highly irradiated environments, and it has been reported that the electronic properties of melanin change following exposure to ionizing radiation. Additionally, several studies have reported the association of melanin production with fungal virulence. Together, these findings demonstrate the need for studies that assess the characteristics of melanized fungi inhabiting spacecraft environments.",

Advances in genome sequencing of A. niger have revealed its capacity to produce many other SMs in addition to the naphtho-γ-pyrones, as its genome harbors 46 PKSs, 35 NRPSs, and 9 NRPS-PKS hybrid genes. Many of these SM biosynthesis genes are silent or expressed at very low levels in standard laboratory conditions, which has resulted in a lack of studies on SMs that may have useful industrial and therapeutic properties. Given that fungi produce SMs in response to environmental stress, investigations into SM production of A. niger strains isolated from space environments may reveal enhanced production levels of bioactive molecules and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying such adaptations.",

In the ISS strain, pestalamide B production was approximately 2 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.03), and bicoumanigrin, which was reported to have cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines, exhibited a production yield 2.5 times that of ATCC 1015 (P = 0.01).

First, we searched for the core backbone synthase gene involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis. The biosynthetic pathway of pyranonigrin E, a SM very similar to pyranonigrin A, was recently proposed and pynA (An11g00250) was identified as the PKS-NRPS hybrid involved in its biosynthesis. We hypothesized that pyranonigrin A is either biosynthesized by the same cluster responsible for pyranonigrin E production, or by a different cluster harboring a PKS-NRPS hybrid gene similar to pynA. The genome of ATCC 1015 possesses 8 PKS-NRPS hybrid genes other than pynA. BLAST analysis was performed using the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) MycoCosm database on the 8 remaining PKS-NRPS hybrids to determine which genes possessed high sequence homology to pynA. The results revealed that An18g00520 (pyrA) possessed high sequence similarity to pynA, with 53.4% sequence identity and 89.8% subject coverage (Supplementary Table S3).",

Next, the pyrG gene was deleted in the kusA- background to generate CW12003, an auxotrophic mutant that requires uracil and uridine supplementation. CW12003 was then used to generate mutant strains CW12004 and CW12005, which had the pynA gene and An18g00520 genes deleted, respectively.

Interestingly, when we compared the genes surrounding pyrA in A. niger to their homologs in P. thymicola using the JGI MycoCosm database, we noticed that the distribution of genes surrounding pyrA differed between the P. thymicola and A. niger genomes (Supplementary Figure S9). For example, pyrD, a hydrolase predicted to be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis in P. thymicola, is adjacent to pyrC in the P. thymicola genome and has only two genes separating it from pyrA. However, its homolog within the A. niger genome, An18g00470, is adjacent to An18g00480 and has four genes separating it from pyrA. Similarly, although An18g00510 is adjacent to pyrA in the A. niger genome, its P. thymicola homolog has three genes separating it from pyrA in the P. thymicola genome, and was predicted to not be involved in pyranonigrin A biosynthesis.

For this analysis, we also investigated genes involved in the production of kotanin, pestalamide B, and albA pathway SMs (aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones), all of which also featured increased production levels in JSC-093350089 (Figure 1). The biosynthetic gene cluster for kotanin has been identified in A. niger, and includes genes encoding non-reducing-PKS (NR-PKS) ktnS, O-methytransferase ktnB, cytochrome P450 ktnC, and flavine-binding monooxygenase ktnD. The biosynthetic gene cluster for pestalamide A was recently elucidated following deletion of the histone acetyltransferase gcnE, which led to production of pestalamide A as well as other SMs. Pestalamide A is a 4H-pyran-4-one derivative of pestalamide B, and therefore pestalamide B is likely formed from the same cluster as pestalamide A. This cluster harbors genes encoding NR-PKS epaA, ferulate:CoA ligase epaB, acyl-CoA transferase epaC, oxidoreductase orf1, 3-hydroxybenzoate 4-hydoxylase orf2, and salicylate hydroxylase orf3. Naphtho-γ-pyrones, including the aurasperones, fonsecinones, asperpyrones, are biosynthesized by albA, which encodes a PKS that is also crucial for melanin production. Tailoring enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of these naphtho-γ-pyrones are not clustered with albA and have not been identified.",

Notably, the second of these deletions, which featured a loss of 13 bps, was predicted to be within the promoter region (genomic coordinates 23456–23311) using PromPredict, which predicts promoter regions based on DNA duplex stability and has been verified across a broad range of eukaryotic genomes.

The transcription factor Fum21 has been reported to play a role in both pyranonigrin A and fumonisin production, with Fum21 deficiency resulting in a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production. Fum21 is regulated by FlbA, which is a regulator of G-protein signaling and plays a major role in sporulation. While the only variant associated with fum21 was a downstream intergenic INDEL, several genetic variants within the flbA promoter (genomic coordinates 815849-815999) were observed, including a 16 bp insertion, a 7 bp deletion, and a 6 bp deletion (Table 3). Our investigation also revealed one splice region insertion and two intergenic INDELs downstream of flbA.",

It has been reported that kusA deletion significantly enhances the sensitivity of A. niger to UV exposure. Therefore, to investigate whether pyranonigrin A confers UV resistance to A. niger, the kusA gene was first reintegrated into the pyrA- deletion strain (CW12005) to generate CW12015. Next, the JSC-093350089 WT and pyrA- strains were exposed to varying doses of UVC radiation ranging from 5–25 mJ/cm2 in triplicate. The results indicated that pyranonigrin A deficiency significantly reduces the viability of UV-exposed strains at doses greater than 15 mJ/cm2 (Figure 3). The effect became more pronounced as the radiation dose increased, with an approximate viability reduction of 34% observed at 15 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), 43% observed at 20 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.005), and 68% observed at 25 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.0002).",

Metabolomic characterization combined with genetic analysis of A. niger strains that have inhabited spacecraft can provide valuable information about SM-based adaptation mechanisms of fungi capable of surviving in such environments. Additionally, despite a substantial effort to map fungal SMs to their biosynthesis genes, most clusters remain unlinked to their final product, which, in many cases, is due to the low production levels of many metabolites. There is therefore significant potential in analyzing SM production in fungal species isolated from various extreme environments, as such conditions may naturally optimize production yields of useful SMs, thereby reducing the cost of laborious laboratory-based optimization.",

Oxidative stress occurs when ROS overwhelm an organism’s antioxidant defense mechanisms, resulting in the generation of oxidative damage among DNA, proteins, lipids, and other vital cell components. Antioxidants have enormous therapeutic potential, as they neutralize the harmful effects of ROS, which can cause or exacerbate a range of human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. Examination of metabolic reserves of fungi isolated from enhanced radiation environments therefore provides a means of identifying fungal strains that produce optimized levels of specific therapeutics, as illustrated by this study.

We therefore extended our study to include genes encoding products known to regulate pyranonigrin A. Thus far, this is limited to the transcription factor Fum21, which is regulated by FlbA, a regulator of G-protein signaling that plays a critical role in sporulation and whose deficiency results in thin cell walls and cell lysis. It has been reported that Fum21 deficiency leads to downregulation of genes from 4 different SM clusters, accompanied by a 25% reduction in pyranonigrin A production and complete elimination of fumonisin production. Although we did not identify any critical mutation within/near fum21, our investigation revealed 3 INDELs that account for the modification of 29 bps within the promoter region of flbA. It is highly probable that these mutations could lead to altered regulation of FlbA, which may help explain the dramatic increase in pyranonigrin A production in the ISS strain. Further experiments should be conducted to confirm this possibility, and to explore the potential impact of the observed promoter-region mutations on other biological processes within A. niger, such as sporulation and cell wall structure, as such studies may provide insight into why these variations may be favorable in ISS conditions. On the other hand, increased pyranonigrin A production levels may also be the result of differences at the epigenetic level, which would be an interesting avenue to explore but was outside the scope of this investigation.",

Two missense mutations were observed within the gene encoding EpaA, the NR-PKS proposed to perform the initial reaction in pestalamide biosynthesis. Notably, INDELs were observed within the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR of orf1. UTRs often contain regulatory elements that play key roles in appropriate expression of a gene, and therefore the observed variation may be responsible for altered regulatory patterns of orf1, which encodes for an oxidoreductase. The gene product of orf1, also known as AzaJ, is also involved in the biosynthesis of the azanigerones, which are produced by the same cluster as the pestalamides. In azanigerone biosynthesis, AzaJ is proposed to catalyze the oxidation of an aldehyde to a carboxylic acid, partially facilitating the transformation of azanigerone C to azanigerone A. In pestalamide biosynthesis, AzaJ was proposed to be involved in the generation of the intermediate carbonarone A from the polyketide precursor, which involves oxidation and transamination. Further studies need to be performed to determine if this step in the pathway is rate-limiting, and if altered expression of azaJ could be responsible for the increase in pestalamide production levels. Another potentially significant mutation that we observed was an insertion in the 3′ UTR of epaB, which encodes an acyl:CoA ligase that may catalyze the formation of 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA, as it plays a similar role in the azanigerone pathway. 2-methylsuccinyl-CoA is then used as a substrate by EpaC followed by cyclization to form pestalamide. Further experiments should be performed to confirm whether the observed 3′ UTR variant alters expression levels of epaB, which then leads to altered pestalamide production levels.",

This may explain the enhanced production levels of pyranonigrin A in the ISS isolate, and is supported by the UV resistance study, which suggests that pyranonigrin A plays a role in conferring radiation resistance in A. niger. Additionally, we observed a cumulative increase in the production of naphtho-γ-pyrones, which are produced by AlbA, the same PKS responsible for 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) biosynthesis. This stays in agreement with the observed enrichment of AlbA in the proteome of JSC-093350089 relative to ATCC 1015. Such observations suggest that the ISS isolate produces enhanced levels of DHN-melanin, and is consistent with previous reports that fungi inhabiting high-radiation environments produce enhanced levels of melanin. In microbial systems, melanin functions as a UV-protectant, an antioxidant, a thermoregulator, and as a toxin-sequestering agent. It is therefore reasonable to presume that increased melanin production may be an adaptive feature that is selected for by spaceflight environments. We were unable to identify any mutations associated with albA that may explain its upregulation and the associated increase in naphtho-γ-pyrone production. Additionally, we could not investigate variants occurring in naphtho-γ-pyrone tailoring enzymes, as those genes are not clustered with albA and have not yet been characterized. Further, as discussed before with regard to the pestalamides, while production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones were reported to increase following deletion of the epigenetic regulator gcnE, we did not identify any mutations associated with gcnE that may explain increased production levels of naphtho-γ-pyrones.",
