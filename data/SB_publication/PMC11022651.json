Despite this, there is much to learn about how humans adapt to the unique challenges of the space environment. The space environment includes unique stressors, such as microgravity (e.g. weightlessness), immune system perturbations, and space radiation exposure. Determining the effects of spaceflight on the human genome is imperative to support long-term human presence in space. Additionally, a host of physiological adaptations occur when humans travel into space, ranging from cardiovascular and musculoskeletal deconditioning, vision changes (e.g. spaceflight associated neuro ocular syndrome), immune suppression, and metabolic changes, among others. Moreover, increasing evidence highlights the systemic immune dysregulation crewmembers experience from spaceflight exposure. Indeed, there appears to be a reduction in T cell frequency, suppressed cytotoxic function, as well as fluctuations in cytokine concentrations, with increased expression of TNF-Î±, interleukin-8, interleukin-1ra, thrombopoietin, VEGF, and various chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, CXCL5, etc.) associated with spaceflight.",

More recently, however, SpaceX launched a crew of four civilian astronauts on the Inspiration4 (I4) mission, marking a new era for human space exploration. The present I4 mission study aims to investigate the impact of short-duration spaceflight on civilians, along with the post-flight and long-term biomedical, immunologic, and genetic alterations resulting from spaceflight. This includes rapid telomeric responses, whereby telomere elongation occurs as a function of spaceflight, followed by shortening upon return to Earth. Both unusually short and long telomeres have been associated with adverse health effects involving aging and age-related pathologies, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, a variety of lifestyle factors and environmental exposures influence telomere length. Previous studies have also shown changes in clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) gain a clonal advantage through the acquisition of somatic mutations. Clonal hematopoiesis is associated with cardiovascular disease, the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and increased overall mortality. The NASA Twins Study shed light on telomeric responses and the chronic inflammatory state resulting from long-duration spaceflight and provided the first measures of telomere length and clonal hematopoiesis in astronauts. Mutations in epigenetic regulators, such as DNMT3A and TET2, were found at increased rates in both career astronaut twins when compared to their civilian counterparts. A retrospective study of 14 astronauts who flew shuttle missions has also shown an elevated presence of genetic abnormalities in CHIP-driver genes in the astronaut population.",

It is imperative to study these adaptations in this context for future space missions, as prolonged space environment exposure could exponentially increase the rate of mutational burden, be it due to the inflammatory milieu resulting from spaceflight or the particular challenges of the space environment, such as microgravity and radiation exposure. Here, we leveraged the I4 mission to examine the development of genetic abnormalities in the astronauts by studying their physiological response to the demands of spaceflight and quantifying the genetic changes that are associated with spaceflight.",

All samples from the testing and validation cohort were sequenced using a custom designed DNA sequencing assay (DB0188, VariantPlex, ArcherDX). This panel captures the nine genes most commonly mutated in solid tumor patients following therapeutic radiation including the full exonic regions of five genes (DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, TP53, CHEK2) and targeted exonic regions of four genes (JAK2, SRSF2, SF3B1, PPM1D). Libraries were prepared from 250 ng gDNA using the VariantPlex protocol (ArcherDx Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) which utilizes Anchored Multiplex PCR (AMP) technology to generate target-enriched sequencing-ready libraries. Following DNA fragmentation ligation with a universal ArcherDx molecular barcode (MBC) adapter is performed, which tags each DNA molecule with a unique molecular index (UMI) and allows for unidirectional amplification of the sample using gene-specific primers. The resulting libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Ilumina), as per manufacturer's instructions. The methods for variant identification are comparable to those in Novetsky et al. 2023. The variant calling pipeline included UMI consensus building followed by utilizing Mutect2, VarDictJava, Lofreq2, Pindel in parallel for variant identification. Normalization was performed via LeftTrimAndAlign, and a panel of normals of 27 children and young adults was used with a bonferroni-corrected p value to identify true putative mutations in our astronaut cohort. A pileup analysis as performed in Bolton et al. 2020 was used to query variants in longitudinal follow-ups. A variant list was used to scrutinize raw BAM files and the PoN samples, a fisher's exact test and Bonferroni-corrected p value were used to determine a noise threshold. Variants surpassing this threshold in at least one sample were further examined in the remaining samples, and if statistically validated, the variants were aggregated to construct the final variant list. Variant-Effect-Predictor VEP (v107) and SnpEff (v4.3) was used for annotation of variants.

Indeed, the monitoring of this crew provides us with a unique opportunity to understand the beginning of the already established relationship between career astronauts and CHIP. Of note, the NASA Twins Study assessed the mutational burden of long-duration spaceflight in CHIP genes and a retrospective study established a burden of CH-related mutations in the career astronaut population and we sought to examine these same CHIP genes for the I4 crew. To address the variant allele frequency (VAF) of CHIP genes, we performed deep targeted sequencing (>15,000x) of 10 known epigenetic regulators and CHIP-associated genes and assessed the mutational burden of short duration spaceflight in the I4 astronaut cohort. Notably, the mutational burden of the CHIP-associated genes did not change as a function of spaceflight and remained stable for up to 6 months post spaceflight (Fig.Â 2A). No known deleterious mutations arose in the I4 cohort post-flight, nor did any pre-existing somatic mutations increase in allele frequency significantly (Fig.Â 2B & C).

            "text": "The NASA Twins Study was the first to report spaceflight-specific telomere elongation in humans, with one astronaut experiencing telomere elongation during his one-year mission, rapid telomere shortening upon return to Earth, and telomere length recovery to near pre-flight baseline values over the following months, although many more short telomeres after spaceflight than before were also observed. Luxton et al. reported similar spaceflight-associated telomere length dynamics in 3 unrelated astronauts on â¼ 6-month missions onboard the ISS. It was hypothesized that such dramatic shifts in telomere length dynamics were associated with chronic exposure to the space radiation environment and represented an adaptive response to chronic oxidative damage, specifically to telomeres, whereby the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway is transiently activated in normal somatic cells. Cytogenetic evidence of heterogeneous telomere lengths and DNA damage responses were also reported, andâtogether with our cfDNA enrichment analysesâsuggested increased DNA damage and are consistent with space radiation exposure and increased senescence-associated foci. Similar changes in telomere length dynamics observed in the I4 crew as a function of spaceflight indicate that telomere length alterations are fast-acting as associated with spaceflight, even for missions of short (e.g. days) duration. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments, originating from various tissues and the immune system, offer a non-invasive method for assessing astronauts' dynamic immune responses to spaceflight-induced physiological stress. As an emerging biomarker, cfDNA concentration and molecular profile yield valuable insights into stress responses in unique spaceflight environments despite its heterogeneous and sensitive nature.",

Previous studies of the relationship between clonal hematopoiesis and astronauts has elucidated that spaceflight increases proportion of CH abnormalities in subjects when compared to healthy controls. It is not clear why that is the case, or when in an astronaut's career these abnormalities begin to appear, a key limitation of studying career astronauts. Previous studies have also shown the influence of acute events on the development of CH abnormalities, such as first responders from the world trade center tragedy. Therefore, the I4 mission is uniquely positioned to characterize the clonal dynamics associated with a short-duration flight, and will allow future comparisons between career astronaut CH abnormalities and civilian space travelers. There is an opportunity to study the compound effects of spaceflight between missions on CH abnormalities if one or more of the I4 astronauts returns to space. This can be leveraged for a better understanding of long-term risk and clonal evolution.",

In the NASA Twins Study, both career astronauts had increased mutational burden in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2 compared to prostate cancer patient controls. Although only one of the twins was in orbital spaceflight for a year, both twins displayed comparable CHIP-related mutations shortly after flight and for several years of follow-up. We continue to monitor the CHIP-related mutational burden of both astronauts years post-flight. The VAF of mutations found in both subjects has, as expected, increased over time, and a new missense variant has been identified in subject HR in the last 3-year follow-up. This is to be expected as CHIP-mutational burden is known to increase as a function of aging. Both astronauts, however, presented clonal burdens that preceded their age-matched control for over two decades at the time of the original study. The fact that TW (space subject) did not present a greater mutational burden post-flight than HR (ground control), despite the length of his last mission, might indicate that the overall number of flights, rather than their duration, is a greater extrinsic factor for clonal positive selection. The I4 cohort provides a unique opportunity to assess the short and long term physiological effects of a singular spaceflight mission. As civilians, the I4 cohort's physiological findings are likely a better representation of what first-time fliers may expect as we gear up toward an increased human presence in space.",

MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 encode subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, which is involved in the reduction of oxygen to water. Decreases in MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 expression cause significant cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial complex IV deficiencies, which may lead to tissue maladaptations. Most mitochondrial genes return to basal levels of expression in our L-92 vs RÂ +Â 82 comparison, suggesting relief from spaceflight-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress. DCs, monocytes, and T cells showed increased MT-ND4L expression over two months after return from flight. The MT-ND4L gene encodes for NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L, a component of the respiratory chain Complex I, a protein required for electron transfer and dehydrogenation from NADH to ubiquinone. Longitudinal changes in its gene expression may suggest that mitochondrial ATP production is altered long after return to earth.
