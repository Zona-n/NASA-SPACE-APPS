            "text": "In C. elegans, unc-89 encodes a set of giant multi-domain proteins (up 8,081 residues) localized to the M-lines of muscle sarcomeres and required for normal sarcomere organization and whole-animal locomotion. Multiple UNC-89 isoforms contain two protein kinase domains. There is conservation in arrangement of domains between UNC-89 and its two mammalian homologs, obscurin and SPEG: kinase, a non-domain region of 647–742 residues, Ig domain, Fn3 domain and a second kinase domain. In all three proteins, this non-domain “interkinase region” has low sequence complexity, high proline content and lacks predicted secondary structure. We report that a major portion of this interkinase (571 residues out of 647 residues) when examined by single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro displays the properties of a random coil and acts as an entropic spring. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create nematodes carrying an in-frame deletion of the same 571-residue portion of the interkinase. These animals display severe disorganization of all portions of the sarcomere in body wall muscle. Super-resolution microscopy reveals extra, short-A-bands lying close to the outer muscle cell membrane and between normally spaced A-bands. Nematodes with this in-frame deletion show defective locomotion and muscle force generation. We designed our CRISPR-generated in-frame deletion to contain an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms. This HA tag results in normal organization of body wall muscle, but approximately half the normal levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms, dis-organization of pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to poor nutritional uptake.",

            "text": "C. elegans UNC-89 is the founding member of the UNC-89/obscurin family of giant muscle proteins. Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines. unc-89 is a complex gene: through the use of three promoters and alternative splicing at least 16 polypeptides are generated, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da. Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B and UNC-89-F, consist of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, our lab has systematically identified its binding partners. We have screened a yeast two hybrid library with segments representing the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners, and 6/7 have orthologs or homologs in humans. Interactions have been verified by a combination of demonstrating binding in vitro using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and identifying muscle mutant phenotypes.",

            "text": "Mammalian striated muscle express three UNC-89-like proteins from separate genes, obscurin (OBSC), obscurin-like 1 (obsl1) and striated muscle preferentially expressed gene (SPEG). UNC-89 is most similar to obscurin, which also expresses many isoforms, including giant isoforms (obscurin A), and shorter isoforms with 2 protein kinase domains. Although UNC-89 is located only at the M-line, various obscurin isoforms are located at either the M-line, or the Z-disk. Mutations in the human OBSC gene result in cardiomyopathies (HCM, DCM, LVNC). In addition to serving as a platform for assembly of M-line proteins, obscurin links myofibrils to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The C-terminus of obscurin interacts with an ankyrin localized to the SR. The obscurin KO mouse has normal myofibril organization but disorganized SR. This myofibril to SR linkage is conserved in nematode UNC-89. Obsl1 is an ~200 kDa protein consisting solely of 20 tandem Ig domains, and in heart muscle is localized to M-lines, Z-disks and intercalated disks. Several portions interact with titin and myomesin at the M-line. However, obsl1 is ubiquitously expressed, global KO is embryonic lethal and mutations in the human Obsl1 gene result in a growth defect (3M-growth syndrome). SPEG also exists as different sized isoforms, but the largest isoform is 3,267 aa and consists of 9 Ig and 2 Fn3 domains, and 2 protein kinase domains. It can be regarded as similar to the C-terminal tandem kinase domain regions of obscurin and UNC-89. SPEG is located in a complex lying between the SR and plasma membrane (JMC) in cardiomyocytes. In the mouse, cardiac-specific KO results in DCM, whereas mutations in human SPEG result in centronuclear myopathy with DCM. The in vivo substrates for the kinase domains of UNC-89, obscurin and SPEG are not known. However, sequence analysis suggests that: (i) UNC-89 PK1 is catalytically inactive, whereas PK2 is an active kinase; (ii) human obscurin PK1 and PK2 are both likely to be active kinases, and each has been shown to undergo autophosphorylation in vitro. Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro. There is a suggestion that SPEG phosphorylates the JMC protein junctophilin 2.",

There is very little sequence homology amongst the non-domain or “interkinase” (IK) regions of these proteins (Supplemental Figure 1). However, these IK regions have in common, a low sequence complexity, high proline content (11.8—13.3%), and an overall paucity of predicted α-helix and β-strands, and thus are likely to be predominantly random coils. These properties of the IK regions are shared with the known highly elastic spring regions of human titin (PEVK and N2A/B). In this paper, we describe, for nematode UNC-89, the response of the interkinase to mechanical pulling and the phenotype of worms in which the interkinase has been deleted in-frame. This is the first time the function of this region has been explored for any member of the UNC-89/obscurin family.",

As shown in Supplemental Figure 2, and in Fig. 1B, there are only short stretches of α-helix (15, 9, 9, 11, 7 and 7 amino acids, from N- to C-terminus of IK), and even fewer and shorter instances of β-strands (3, 2, 3, 4 and 6 amino acids). Except for the 15-residue long region near the IK N-terminus, all the other instances of α-helices reside in the C-terminal one third of the IK sequence. These α-helices reside within the C-terminal 232 residues which is the minimal binding site determined for LIM-9 (FHL2), and thus may comprise an unrecognized or novel domain. Thus, the remaining sequence of UNC-89 IK, approximately, 475 residues, is random coil. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2 and Fig. 1B, obscurin and SPEG have even fewer predicted secondary structure elements, although like UNC-89, obscurin has a fairly long α-helix of 19 residues lying within the C-terminal 52 residues.",

            "text": "Given the nature of the amino acid sequence of the IK region of UNC-89, we wished to determine how it might respond to a mechanical pulling force using the single molecule force spectroscopy technique. To carry this out, we first expressed in E. coli 1 571 residue segment comprising the majority of the 645 residue interkinase region (IK) flanked on the N- and C-terminus by two copies of Ig27 from human titin. The response of Ig27 to pulling force is well documented and served as an internal control. In addition, the protein had a 6XHis tag at its N-terminus (Fig. 2A). After purification (Fig. 2B), the protein was allowed to attach to a glass surface coated with Ni2+-NTA to allow binding of the N-terminus of this polyprotein via its 6XHis tag. The stylus of the single-molecule force spectrometer was allowed to bind non-specifically and at random points along the polyprotein, and then pulling force was applied by moving the piezo-electric platform downward. A representative force curve of the mechanical unfolding of the polyprotein in which the stylus had attached to the C-terminus is shown in Fig. 2C. After a long and featureless trace without energy barriers, the typical unwinding of the 4 Ig domains is found. The statistical distribution of the contour length of the long featureless peak (Fig. 2D) shows that the mean contour is approximately 185 nm. This is a good match to the expected contour length of a fully unwound polypeptide of 571 amino acids, since the average length of an amino acid is 0.34 nm, i.e. 0.34 nm/aa × 571 aa = 194 nm. Based on this force curve and contour length, we can conclude that the IK has the mechanical properties of a random coil and behaves like an entropic spring.",

To do this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to create an in-frame deletion of the same 571 residues that we explored with the single molecule method in vitro. However, to be able to monitor the expression of UNC-89 large isoforms in which the IK had been deleted we added an HA tag to the N-terminus of the large isoforms. We thought such tagged UNC-89 could also be used in future immunoprecipitation experiments to identify proteins in a complex with UNC-89. Animals expressing HA-UNC-89 large isoforms were obtained by CRISPR/Cas9, and the strain is designated unc-89(syb797). The proper fusion of a tag containing three consecutive HA sequences to the normal N-terminus of the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by Sanger sequencing (Supplemental Figure 3). The presence of the HA tag on the large UNC-89 isoforms was verified by western blot (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the HA-UNC-89 proteins could be detected by confocal microscopy to be normally localized to the sarcomeric M-lines of body wall muscle (Fig. 3B). The HA tag also does not affect the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres as assessed by confocal microscopy using phalloidin for I-bands, or antibodies to myosin heavy chain A for A-bands, UNC-89 for M-lines, UNC-95 for the bases of M-lines and dense bodies, or ATN-1 (α-actinin) for the major portion of dense bodies (Fig. 4). As shown later, this HA tag also does not affect whole animal locomotion. However, HA tag does reduce the abundance of the UNC-89 giant isoforms (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). With an n=2, the level of expression from unc-89(syb797) is 51.2% (standard deviation of 11%) of the level from wild type.",

We had hoped to be able to use an antibody to PK2 to prove that the deletion is in-frame, however, two attempts to make such an antibody (in rabbits or rats) failed. Nevertheless, since the levels of large isoforms did not diminish below that shown with the HA tag (in syb797), it is likely that we achieved an in-frame deletion which does not destabilize the protein. We expected to observe slightly smaller giant isoforms from syb797syb1257 compared to wild type, but there seems to be no discernible difference (Fig. 5B). Although there are at least 14 predicted giant isoforms ranging from 5,000 to 8,081 residues each, we do not know the relative abundance of each of these giant isoforms. Deletion of 571 residues out of a total of 8,081 residues for the largest isoform would be only a decrease of 7% and may not be a difference detectable by the gel system used. However, as shown in Fig. 5C, the internal deletion of the IK of UNC-89 results in disorganization of M-lines in body wall muscle. This can be seen when either an established monoclonal for UNC-89, MH42, or anti-HA is used in immunostaining. In fact, the signals from each antibody overlap.",

To assess sarcomere organization of the IK deletion, we took the same strategy as we did to characterize the sarcomere organization of unc-89(syb797): immunolocalization of several proteins with known sarcomere locations using confocal microscopy. Deletion of IK (in mutant syb797syb1257) results in disorganization of sarcomeres in all substructures (Fig. 6). It is important to note however that in syb797syb1257, although the pattern of UNC-89 is disorganized (i.e. not parallel straight lines as in syb797 or wild type), UNC-89 is still detectable at high levels consistent with the western blot result. Note also that in syb797syb1257, the disorganization of UNC-89 appears quite similar to the pattern of disorganization of myosin heavy chain A (MHC A). This is not unexpected as thick filaments in nematode body wall muscle have differential localization of two myosin heavy chain isoforms, with MHC A in the middle, and MHC B in the major outer portions. Normally thick filaments are arranged parallel and in register, so that the M-line is the structure in the middle of the A-band, which contains MHC A, and where the thick filaments are crosslinked. Thus, when imaging C. elegans body wall muscle with light microscopy, the localization of MHC A and UNC-89 are nearly identical. Note that upon anti-UNC-95 staining, the bases of M-lines are often branched and can overlap the bases of dense bodies (Fig. 6, right inset). Overall, these results indicate that the IK is required for the proper organization of sarcomeres.",

However, in-frame deletion of IK (in syb797syb1257), for both MHC A and UNC-89 immunostaining, it is evident that the A-bands are broken, and much of the parallel arrangement is missing. In addition, there appear to be extra, short A-bands (indicated by arrows in Fig. 7) that lie in the spaces between otherwise nearly normal A-bands. By capturing optical sections with an interval of 0.2 μm, we noticed that these partial A-bands lie mostly close to the outer cell membrane of the muscle cells.

Given the disorganization of sarcomeres in the body wall muscle of nematodes expressing large isoforms of UNC-89 with an in-frame deletion of the IK, we wondered if these animals would display defects in movement or in muscle force generation. First, because our strain with the IK deletion also contains an N-terminal HA tag, we measured locomotion in the strain with the HA tag alone, syb797. As shown in Fig. 8A and B, syb797 is not slower in swimming or crawling as compared to wild type. In fact, syb797 displays a statistically faster swimming than wild type. However, clearly, syb797syb1257, containing both an HA tag and IK deletion shows a 15% reduction in swimming and a 30% reduction in crawling (Fig. 8A and B). This decrease in swimming speed is comparable to that displayed by the canonical unc-89 allele e1460, but not as severe as that of alleles su75 or tm752 (Fig. 8A). The decrease in crawling of the IK deletion strain is not as severe as 3 of 4 other alleles tested (e1460, su75, tm752). In terms of muscle force exerted, as measured by the NemaFlex assay, all mutant alleles (including syb797 syb1257) except for tm752 are defective compared to wild type (Fig. 8C). Interestingly, syb797, which has an HA tag at the N-terminus of the large isoforms, shows no decrease in crawling, but an increase in swimming, and decreased ability to generate force. This phenotype of increased speed of swimming, no change or even increased speed of crawling, and yet decreased force, is shared with the allele ad539. unc-89(ad539), like syb797, has normally organized sarcomeres in body wall muscle, which likely accounts for lack of any decrease in swimming or crawling. (We first showed that unc-89(ad539) has normally organized sarcomeres by EM, but to verify this result we have immunostained its muscle with a variety of antibodies to sarcomeric proteins, and all of these are normally localized (Supplemental Figure 5)).",

Based on this, and the similarity of ad539 with syb797, we examined the pharyngeal muscle structure of both these alleles, and additional alleles of unc-89 using polarized light microscopy (Fig. 9). As first noted by Waterston et al., in unc-89(e1460), instead of the radially oriented filaments observed in the posterior bulb of wild type, this mutant has longitudinally oriented filaments at the periphery of the bulb (indicated by yellow arrow in Fig. 9). In fact, all the unc-89 mutants that we imaged show this defect except for tm752, which shows normal pharyngeal muscle organization. Remarkably, syb797, with the HA tag, shows the same defect. However, ad539 shows not only the defect in the terminal bulb; it also shows a defect in the anterior bulb (blue arrows in Fig. 9). The only other unc-89 allele that shows both bulbs affected is su75.",

This was done by co-immunostaining worms with antibodies to UNC-89 and to the pharyngeal myosin heavy chain MHC C. We have previously demonstrated that in wild type, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments in pharyngeal muscle. As shown in Fig. 10, UNC-89 is localized to the middle of thick filaments throughout the pharynx. However, in syb797 there is no detectable expression of UNC-89 in the posterior bulb. In ad539 there is no observable expression of UNC-89 throughout the pharynx. Moreover, MHC C staining reveals that in both syb797 and ad539, there are abnormal accumulations of thick filaments at the periphery of the posterior bulb (indicated by yellow arrows in Fig. 10), corresponding to the arcs observed by polarized light. The expression defects in the mutants seem to correspond with the defects in pharyngeal muscle organization and indicate that UNC-89 is required for normal organization of sarcomeres in pharyngeal muscle.",

In the case of UNC-89 IK, which was studied here, as shown in Fig. 1B, JPred predicts only short stretches of α-helices, primarily in the C-terminal third of the IK, and the majority of the sequence is predicted to be random coil. By use of single molecule force spectroscopy in vitro (Fig. 2) we showed that this IK sequence, is likely to be a random coil since it acts like an entropic spring upon application of pulling force. The nature of the IK sequence (random coil) and its physical properties (entropic spring) is shared with the highly elastic spring elements (PEVK, N2B) of another giant muscle protein, titin. In the case of titin, there is good evidence to suggest that these elements unwind when muscle sarcomeres are stretched beyond their relaxed state, store potential energy and then provide a passive restoring force to allow the sarcomeres to return to their resting (relaxed) lengths.",

As Supplemental Figure 6 shows the overall secondary structure of the I27 polyprotein (dotted line) is similar to published data on I27 polyproteins showing maximum around 200 nm a minimum at ~212nm, a characteristic of a mainly β-strand structure.

            "text": "The normal location of UNC-89 is the M-line, the structure in which thick filaments are cross linked in the middle of the A-band. Deletion of the IK, in addition to disrupting the normal continuous and parallel M-lines or A-bands, results in formation of short A-bands which are not full-depth but confined to the portion nearest the outer muscle cell membrane, and these occur between normally spaced A-bands. Sarcomere assembly is known to occur from the outside inwards, first with the deposition of ECM proteins like perlecan, followed by localization of integrins, and then localization of integrin adhesion proteins (UNC-112 (kindlin), PAT-4 (ILK), UNC-97 (PINCH), PAT-6 (α-parvin), followed by assembly of M-line or dense body (Z-disk)-specific proteins. We know that UNC-89 interacts with CPNA-1, which in turn interacts with PAT-6, a member of the 4- protein complex that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of PAT-3 (β-integrin). It should be noted that CPNA-1 interacts with Ig1-Ig3, which is near the N-terminus of UNC-89 and remote from IK. Our results seem to indicate that these protein interactions at the membrane are not sufficient for full assembly of a M-line/A-band, and the proper spacing between A-bands. Either the length or the elasticity of UNC-89 IK is required. In future experiments, we can determine the minimum length of IK that is sufficient for full A-band assembly, and whether elasticity is crucial. We could replace the elastic IK with a sequence of similar length that is rigid. An example of a rigid sequence that could be used is the series of 4 consecutive Ig domains in human titin that are not separated by linker sequences. It is tempting to speculate that the length of the interkinase is important for somehow determining the spacing between adjacent A-bands. Another possibility is that deletion of the IK in some way interferes with the activity of the active protein kinase domain of UNC-89 PK2. This is not likely because inactivation of PK2 does not result in a defect in sarcomere organization (Matsunaga et al., manuscript in preparation). So far, we have only examined the organization of body wall muscle sarcomeres in adult muscle. Therefore, we cannot distinguish a role for UNC-89 IK for sarcomere assembly vs. sarcomere stability. Indeed, it is likely that UNC-89 has more of a role in maintaining or stabilizing sarcomere structure: In strong loss of function alleles like unc-89(e1460), A-band organization is normal in early larvae, despite the fact that UNC-89 is expressed even in embryonic muscle.",

We designed this for future immunoprecipitation experiments to further test whether UNC-89 interacting partners that we have discovered primarily through two hybrid screens are actually associated with UNC-89: we would create in-frame deletions of segments of UNC-89 that are suspected to bind to a partner, then IP those internally deleted UNC-89 proteins, and look for absence of the association. Somewhat surprisingly, this HA tag reduces the level of expression of the giant UNC-89 isoforms to approximately half of their wild type levels in whole worm extracts. And although the HA tag does not affect the organization of sarcomeres in body wall muscle or the ability of whole animals to swim or crawl, it does reduce the ability to generate muscle force. In addition, the HA tag results in a defect in thick filaments in the terminal bulb of the pharynx. Moreover, the level of expression of UNC-89 is reduced in the terminal bulb, consistent with the western blot result. This suggests that the HA tag at the N-terminus either reduces the stability of pharyngeal-specific UNC-89 mRNA or protein isoforms, or interferes with interaction with binding partners found only in pharyngeal muscle. Although our extensive yeast two-hybrid screens did not reveal any binding partners for the N-terminus of UNC-89, these screens cannot reveal all relevant binding partners. Also, it is possible that the HA tag reduces the steady state levels of the giant UNC-89 isoforms in both pharyngeal and body wall muscle, below a critical level required for pharyngeal but not for body wall muscle sarcomere assembly and/or stability.",

In fact, the only mutant studied that generates normal force is tm752 that does so despite having mildly disorganized body wall muscle. The key to explaining why these two mutants generate less force appears to be their reduced body diameters. In fact, as shown in Table 1, all the mutants generating less force have smaller than wild type body diameters, and defective pharynxes. tm752 has a normal body diameter and a normal pharynx. Our speculation is that all the mutants with defective pharynxes have reduced nutrition and consequently are smaller. Although our force measurements were normalized for body diameter, it is possible that reduced nutrition results in reduced metabolism and reduced energy production, and thus less ability to generate force. It is also curious that both syb797 and ad539 display greater swimming speeds and ad539 shows greater crawling speed. Perhaps this is because these thinner animals can bend more easily.",

PHX1257 unc-89(syb797syb1257) was created from PHX797 to contain a 4,614 bp in-frame deletion of the interkinase region, using sgRNAs with the following sequences: Sg1:CCTGTAGCACCGGAAGGTCGACG, Sg2:CCACCACCGACTGTGGAATACGT, Sg3:AACAGCAATTGAGAGAATTAAGG and Sg4:CCACAAAGAAGAATGATGATGGA. Sanger sequencing was used to verify the sequence alterations of each strain (Supplemental Figures 3 and 4). Both strains were outcrossed 5 times to wild type to remove most of the possible off target effects of CRISPR/Cas9; PHX797 to GB312, and PHX1257 to GB313.",

Ten, 10 second videos were recorded for each nematode strain from different sections of the plate, each video tracking the motion of ~10 worms. The video data was analyzed by Image J FIJI WrmTracker software to obtain body bends per second (BBPS) from a total of 48–83 individual worms for each strain. The resulting worm tracks for each animal were observed, with immobilized animals in addition to upper and lower range outliers being removed from BBPS values for each strain prior to the statistical analysis.

            "text": "The maximum exertable muscle force by C. elegans strains was measured using the NemaFlex technique as previously described. The technique is based on deflection of soft micropillars as the animals are crawling through the micropillar arena. The micropillar devices had pillars arranged in a square lattice with a pillar diameter of 44 μm and height of 87 μm. The gap between the pillars is 71 μm. Age synchronized day 1 adult animals were loaded individually in each chamber, and a 1-minute video was captured for each animal in a food-free environment at a temperature of 20 ± 1 °C. Imaging was performed in brightfield using a Nikon Ti-E microscope and Andor Zyla sCMOS 5.5 camera. Images were acquired at 5 frames per second with a 4x objective at a pixel resolution of 1.63 μm per pixel. Movies were then processed and analyzed for force values using our in-house-built image processing software (MATLAB, R2016a). Animal force measurements were calculated by identifying the maximal force exerted in each frame for an individual animal. We define the maximum exertable force f95 corresponding to the 95th percentile of these maximal forces. To account for differences in animal body diameter, we normalize f95 by the cube of animal body diameter. To compare muscle forces of mutants with wild-type animals, we take the ratio of this normalized maximum exertable force and denote it as fold change in muscle force. Statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.",
