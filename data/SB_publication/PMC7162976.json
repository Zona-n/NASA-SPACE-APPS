We have previously shown that a diet supplemented with dried plum powder (DP) prevented radiation-induced bone loss in mice. In this study, we investigated the capacity of the DP diet to prevent bone loss in mice following exposure to simulated spaceflight, combining microgravity (by hindlimb unloading) and radiation exposure. The DP diet was effective at preventing most decrements in bone micro-architectural and mechanical properties due to hindlimb unloading alone and simulated spaceflight. Furthermore, we show that the DP diet can protect osteoprogenitors from impairments resulting from simulated microgravity. Based on our findings, a dietary supplementation with DP could be an effective countermeasure against the skeletal deficits observed in astronauts during spaceflight.",

There are multiple stressors associated with spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation which are known to cause bone loss. Decrements in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed in astronauts from the Mir missions as well as missions to the International Space Station (ISS). While much research has focused on the detrimental effects of microgravity on skeletal tissue, less is known about the impact of spaceflight radiation. Crewed missions have, to this point, primarily remained within low-Earth orbit (LEO). While sources of ionizing space radiation within LEO include galactic cosmic radiation and charged particles from unpredictable solar particle events (SPE), the presence of the Earth’s magnetosphere reduces exposure to ionizing space radiation. Missions beyond LEO pose the greatest risk of radiation exposure and is of significant concern for crew health. Spaceflight-relevant radiation includes a mix of low-linear energy transfer (LET) species such as protons and helium ions as well as high-LET species such as iron. Beyond LEO, for example, astronauts may be exposed to up to 0.7 Sv of ionizing radiation during a multi-year mission to the Moon or Mars.",

            "text": "On Earth, bone homeostasis is effectively maintained by the controlled remodeling activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. However, exposure to low-LET radiation (137Cs or X-ray, 1–2 Gy) leads to a transient increase in the number of osteoclasts, accompanied by an increase in trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and decrease in trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), overall leading to a reduction in bone volume fraction (BV/TV). Together, this early increase in bone resorption and decrease in bone formation due to radiation exposure can result in a state of osteopenia, potentially leading to an increased risk of bone fracture. A possible mechanism of action responsible for these changes in bone homeostasis is the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to radiation exposure. Furthermore, reduction of antioxidant defense mechanisms and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines have been associated with altered redox-balance due to radiation exposure. Together, these critical changes in cellular signaling lead to compromised bone strength and increased fracture risk. Due to the involvement of redox-signaling in radiation-induced bone loss, antioxidants have been considered as candidate countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced bone loss. Proposed mechanisms by which antioxidants exert protective effects include the quenching of ROS via an increase in antioxidant activity and decreasing pro-inflammatory signaling cascades.",

Dried plum’s positive effects on bone health markers have been investigated in multiple models of osteopenia, in both human clinical trials and rodent studies. While the mechanism of action of dried plum is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that the high antioxidant capacity and high polyphenolic content of this fruit scavenges free-radicals as well as promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption. Our lab has reported that mice fed a diet composed of Dried Plum (DP) prevented cancellous bone loss caused by ionizing radiation (IR), both low-LET such as gamma (137Cs) and a mixture of both low-LET and high-LET (sequential beam of proton, 1H and iron, 56Fe). The proposed mechanism for DP’s protective effect is via the prevention of radiation-induced increases in markers of bone resorption, inflammation and oxidative stress.",

The current literature indicates that simulated microgravity and IR each have detrimental effects on cancellous bone structure, although there is no consensus on whether simulated microgravity and IR cause additive or synergistic effects when combined. Thus, more studies are needed to determine whether combining simulated microgravity and IR leads to cumulative effects compared to simulated microgravity and IR alone. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is widely used to simulate the effects of the microgravity environment in rodents. This model allows for a simulation of the cephalad fluid shift and removal of load-bearing forces typically experienced by the hindlimbs, which can lead to increased numbers of bone-resorbing osteoclasts and decreased numbers of bone-forming osteoblasts. Together, these events result in bone loss as well as reduced bone mechanical properties in rodents. In addition, exposure to microgravity in mice adversely affects osteoprogenitors. The bone marrow niche contains osteoblast progenitors cells and it has been shown that exposure to microgravity alters the cells proliferation capacity and impairs their ability to produce extracellular matrix, in turn inhibiting the maturation of the bone matrix. Thus, the ability to maintain bone homeostasis is diminished.",

For this study, we utilized the HU model and exposure to total body irradiation (137Cs gamma radiation, at 2 Gy dose) as analogs of weightlessness and radiation exposure, respectively. A relatively high dose of radiation (2 Gy) was chosen as a positive control dose to ensure bone loss in rodents and to allow for testing of DP as a countermeasure, as previously described. We sought to determine whether DP diet prevents simulated microgravity-induced bone loss alone, and in combination with radiation, as compared to respective control diet controls. We also assessed the ability of DP to mitigate simulated weightlessness- and/or radiation-induced changes to the axial skeleton, specifically the lumbar 4 (L4) vertebrae. We analyzed both cancellous and cortical bone microarchitecture as well as mechanical properties of skeletal tissue. Additionally, we determined whether the DP diet had the capacity to protect osteoprogenitors after exposure to simulated microgravity, an essential part in the healthy maintenance of skeletal tissue.",

Overall, mice fed the CD diet and exposed to simulated spaceflight led to a thinning of the trabeculae and greater separation between trabeculae, leading to a significant decrease in the BV/TV within the cancellous compartment. In DP-fed mice, the combination of HU and IR led to a statistically significant decline in Tb.Th relative to HU or IR alone.

Mechanical properties of interest included maximum load (i.e. the greatest force endured by the material before failure), and stiffness (i.e. the force needed to displace the material a standard distance). The maximum load for mice on the CD diet was 35% and 36% lower after exposure to HU and HU + IR respectively, compared to NL controls (Fig. 5, panel a). Based on our analysis, stiffness normalized to vertebral height in the CD fed groups did not meet criteria for a significant decrease when exposed to HU or HU + IR (Fig. 5, panel b). There was however a notable trend that HU (−40%) and HU + IR (−25%) led to decreased vertebral stiffness. We did however, see that there is an 85% greater stiffness in the DP fed, HU group compared to the CD-fed, HU group indicating that when exposed to HU, DP alone improved the stiffness of the vertebrae. Representative force-displacement curves are shown in Fig. 5 for the mice fed the CD diet (panel c) versus mice fed the DP diet (panel d). Mice fed the DP diet did not show significant decrements in maximum load or stiffness relative to CD-fed, NL mice.

A diet supplemented with DP prevented most of the simulated spaceflight-induced damages to both the appendicular (i.e. tibia) and axial (i.e. vertebrae) skeleton. When mice were fed the control diet, a relatively high dose (2 Gy) of low-LET gamma radiation exclusively decreased the BV/TV and Tb.Sp of cancellous tissue in the tibia. Based on our results, cancellous bone loss was caused by a thinning, not a decrease in the number, of existing trabeculae, which overall, expanded the space between trabeculae. HU for 14 days caused bone loss within both cancellous and cortical regions of the tibia and the L4 vertebrae. HU also led to reduced compressive strength of the vertebral body. The independent effects of HU and IR remained of similar magnitude in each tissue compartment when mice were exposed to HU and IR simultaneously. Regardless of the treatment (with one exception, Ct.Th proximal tibia), consumption of the dried plum diet prevented detrimental skeletal changes.",

The decrease in trabecular thickness incurred by HU and HU + IR was entirely prevented by consumption of the DP diet. The DP diet also protected from HU-induced decrease in cortical thickness. Unlike the proximal tibia, the distal tibia did not show changes in cortical structure. In contrast, in the proximal tibia HU and IR together, not each treatment alone, caused a decrease in cortical thickness of the proximal tibia.

Under conditions of simulated weightlessness and consumption of control diet, BV/TV and Tt.Tb.Th of the vertebral body were reduced accompanied by a reduction in cortical thickness and cortical bone area. Collectively, these findings indicate an overall deterioration of bone via thinning of the vertebrae’s trabeculae and cortical tissue. This deterioration of the microarchitecture directly impacted the overall strength of the tissue, as reflected in the decrease in maximum load tolerable by the vertebral body, as well as the decrease in material stiffness as measured by mechanical compression testing. Taken together, these changes in both microarchitecture and strength have the potential to lead to fracture. However, these changes were not observed when mice were exposed to IR alone. In contrast to other studies where high-LET 56Fe radiation was utilized in combination with HU, our results did not indicate an additive effect of IR on the deterioration of strength and structure of the L4 vertebrae. HU-induced damage to the vertebral body was entirely prevented when mice consumed the DP diet. Interestingly, there was a statistically significant increase in Tt.BV/TV (9%, Fig. 4, panel a) for sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the DP compared to the sham-irradiated, NL mice fed the CD. This elevated Tt.BV/TV was consistent for all treatment groups fed DP when compared to NL, CD-fed mice, suggesting a potential anabolic effect of DP.",

When evaluated in combination with our findings, this supports the potential mechanism that dried plum activates osteoblasts, which may lead to an increase in bone formation. It should be noted, however, that another paper published by the same group showed that fractions of dried plum polyphenols were not as effective at preventing bone loss in a rodent model of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in comparison to a diet supplemented with whole dried plum. Thus, follow-up studies are needed to compare the potential protective effect of these polyphenol fractions on bone exposed to simulated microgravity and ionizing radiation.

Further studies also are needed to gain more insight into any potential long-term side effects of consuming a dried plum diet.

The geometry of the cortical shell was assessed separately at the posterior side of the vertebral body, as this region displays concentrated stress during uniaxial compression.",

            "text": "The vertebral column was processed to isolate the L4 vertebra and further prepared for mechanical testing as described previously. In brief, all soft tissue was carefully removed, and endplates and posterior elements were removed using a diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany) to isolate the vertebral body and ensure plano-parallel testing surfaces. Uniaxial compressive monotonic testing was performed as described previously. In brief, after microCT was performed as detailed above, uniaxial compressive testing was performed at ambient temperature at a platen displacement rate of 0.01 mm/sec. Force (N) and displacement (mm) data were collected during testing (1,000 Hz; WinTest 7, version 7.01). Mechanical testing was not performed on samples in which the vertebral body was compromised during sample preparation. Thus, the sample size per group was as follows: n = 10 (CD, NL), n = 5 (CD, IR), n = 8 (CD, HU), n = 7 (CD, HU + IR), n = 8 (DP, NL), n = 6 (DP, IR), n = 9 (DP, HU), and n = 6 (DP, HU + IR). Custom MATLAB code (Version R2017a, The Mathworks, Inc., Natick, MA) was used to analyze the data and obtain maximum load at failure (N) and stiffness (N/mm). Stiffness is defined as the force required to displace a specimen a set distance, or the slope of the specimen’s force-displacement curve. Thus, stiffness was calculated as the slope of a line that best fit the middle 80% of data points in the range between the force at displacement = 0 and maximum load (i.e. a consistently linear region of the curve for all specimens). Reported stiffness (N/strain) was normalized by the height of the vertebra, as determined by microCT (Fig. 5, panel b). Due to the variation in cross-sectional area of the vertebral body from cranial to caudal ends, the elastic modulus and ultimate stress were not calculated.",
