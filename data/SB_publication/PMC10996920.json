CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab–Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.",

Research shows that there is genetic control over the high-level usage of specific gene segments, but individual CDR3 repertoires are highly variable. Previous work shows that variations in recombination signal sequences, which are the sequences beside the gene segment that regulate recombination, may lead to differential usage of a specific gene segment in the repertoire. Additionally, locations of gene segments on the genome also play a role in gene segment selection in humans with more 3’ D-gene segments pairing more commonly with more 5’ J-gene segments and more 5’ D-gene segments pairing with more 3’ J-gene segments. After the gene segments are spliced, additional nucleotides, called N or P nucleotides, are added at the junction between gene segments. P nucleotides are palindromic and complete the overhangs made during exonuclease cuts in the genome. N nucleotides are random nucleotides added by TdT. In the mouse repertoire, P nucleotides are more common than N nucleotides and help drive diversity.",

Our group has had the opportunity to examine the Ab repertories in C57BL/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that Ab diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight, and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect Ab diversity. To test this hypothesis, we will present an analysis of Ab diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five datasets we have generated using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts, specifically the Shannon index (SI), an established measure of diversity. The higher the SI, the more diversity the community. Immunologically, repertoire diversity is essential to maintain a healthy adaptive immune system. Theoretically, if an individual has a diverse Ab repertoire, there are more possibilities of productive responses to more Ags. Therefore, diversity measurements of the Ab repertoire are relevant to understanding host fitness (as defined immunologically and ecologically). For example, work by Greiff et al. has shown that diversity measures can determine if an animal was vaccinated or unvaccinated.",

Our study examines a total of 1,173,166 unique Ab sequences arising from 44 individual and 18 pooled animals across four experiments.",

Given that mice have 1 × 108 total B cells, unique B cells account for ~0.3–0.03% of the repertoire, based on CDR3 capture. Our results contrast other estimations of shared naive B cells at 11–13%.

We also detected a pattern in the rank-abundance curves for each pool. One predominant CDR3 comprised the highest rank, and abundance quickly dropped as rank increased, demonstrating that the population was highly skewed.

Although T cell repertoires have been examined during spaceflight, little research exists examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire. We found no statistical difference between SIs for ground and flight animals, but a trend (p = 0.1138) toward lower diversity in the flight animals was detected. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 wk at flight), and a different strain (C57BL/6Tac) than used in the other experiments that were analyzed in this paper. Additionally, the flight was relatively short, with only 3 wk in microgravity. Age is known to affect the Ab repertoire by reducing diversity and other works have shown that aged humans respond poorly to vaccinations. Aging decreases B and T cell regeneration rates. Because the half-life of a B cell in the spleen is between 4 and 7 wk, a longer flight time may strengthen the lower diversity trend we noticed. The sample size was also small because these data were obtained as a secondary science objective from an initial validation flight and a larger sample size may provide more information regarding this trend.",

These differences mean that a direct comparison is less than ideal, but given the relative scarcity of data from flight animals, the comparison is nonetheless valuable. We found that the control animals (CASIS ground and TARDIS loaded) and experimental animals (CASIS flight and TARDIS unloaded) were not statistically different. However, when the complete CASIS dataset was compared with the complete TARDIS dataset, we found that the CASIS animals had significantly lower SIs. Although our total read counts were similar between the two experiments (CASIS, 66,909–181,703; TARDIS average, 82,655–109,107), the low number of samples in the CASIS dataset (n = 6) compared with the TARDIS dataset (n = 32) is more likely to be skewed by a single low diversity mouse.

However, there was a trend for a higher abundance of the rank one splenic CDR3 in TT-treated animals (p = 0.0571). In the bone marrow, only TT-treated animals showed a reduced diversity SIs. Unloading again did not affect TT− or TT + CpG1826–treated animals. Both the higher abundance rank one CDR3s and the lower diversity are indicative of the TT-specific response. As the repertoire narrows to focus on responding to the Ag, the total number of unique CDR3s is likely to decrease, decreasing overall diversity.

This could be because the populations of cells in the bone marrow are less diverse because they are memory populations waiting to respond to agonists. Splenic and circulating B cells may be more diverse because they are less experienced. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that V-gene segment usage by naive B cells in the spleen and pre–B cells in the bone marrow are strongly influenced by the genetic background of the animal, whereas the plasma cells are a mostly individual variation. Our workflow does not allow us to identify the cells that make up our population.

Interestingly, this CDR3 is predominately composed of an IgM response, rather than the anticipated IgG response (data not shown). Although these data are from the pooling of two animals, the high repertoire percentage likely arose in a single animal. However, we found no difference in the TT-specific repertoire SIs as compared with the TARDIS TT + CpG1826 spleen or bone marrow.

Although CARGAYW occurred at very high counts (3598) in some animals, it occurred at much lower counts in others. This is consistent with previous data published by Greif et al. showing that public clones have variable frequencies. One specific V/J combination, V1–80/J2, was the predominant combination, with over 77% of the CDR3s formed from these two gene segments. V1–80/J2 (14.6%) and V1–80/J4 (6.1%) also contributed to the pairings. All other combinations were found in <0.5% of the sequences. Interestingly, our previous work has shown that V1–80 is one of the most commonly used V-gene segments in the mouse repertoire. In comparison, when we examined a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, one combination (V9–3/J1) comprised 99.9% of combinations detected. The identification of the three other combinations (V3–5/J1, V1–22/J1, and V9–1/J1) may be the result of sequencing errors.

We have demonstrated that trends or significant reduction in diversity occur in response to hindlimb suspension and TT vaccination in the bone marrow. A reduced diversity is also found in the bone marrow as compared with the spleen. However, comparisons of the anti-TT repertoire to the overall repertoire of the spleen and bone marrow revealed no differences in SIs. We also were not able to detect CDR3 signatures by experiment, treatment, or tissue. We examined the V/J combinations for two common public CDR3s and found more variation in V/J pairing in the shorter CDR3 when compared with the longer CDR3. Finally, from this large multidata, we observe that there is significant individual-to-individual CDR3 uniqueness. These data suggest that an animal’s Ab repertoire is quite unique, even in a highly inbred animal. Evolutionarily, this makes sense and maximizes the possibility that the unique repertoire will allow survival against the widest array of pathogens. This is not a new concept, but these data help to support that hypothesis. Additional sequences will be needed to solidify the hypotheses generated from our analyses.",
