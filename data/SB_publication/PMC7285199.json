            "text": "Aging and healthspan are determined by both environmental and genetic factors. The insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1) pathway is a key mediator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Specifically, DAF-2 signaling, an ortholog of human IGF, controls DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, a master regulator of metabolism and longevity. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are both linked to aging. We propose that daily supplementation of tart cherry extract (TCE), rich in anthocyanins with antioxidant properties may exert dual benefits for mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, resulting in beneficial effects on aging in C. elegans. We found that TCE supplementation at 6 μg or 12 μg/mL, increased (p < 0.05) the mean lifespan of wild type N2 worms, respectively, when compared to untreated control worms. Consistent with these findings, TCE upregulated (p < 0.05) expression of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2 (but not daf-2 or akt-1 genes) and genes related to oxidative stress such as sod-2. Further, we showed that TCE supplementation increased spare respiration in N2 worms. However, TCE did not change the mean lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms. In conclusion, our findings indicate that TCE confers healthspan benefits in C. elegans through enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative stress, mainly via the DAF-16 pathway.",

Excessive ROS production causes oxidative stress, which is a predominant factor in the pathophysiology of various diseases and aging in human and other models such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and Drosophila. Calorie restriction is the most established method for successfully extending lifespan of animals and model organisms such as C. elegans. However, human studies are scarce, and the safety and effectiveness of calorie restriction for lifespan extension in humans is controversial.

C. elegans DAF-2 signaling, which is orthologous to insulin and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in mammals, is also involved in metabolism and longevity but is negatively regulated by DAF-16/FOXO signaling. Additionally, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a conserved energy sensor in cells, extends lifespan of C. elegans. In addition to these major pathways and genes, ROS is also involved in regulating longevity. High ROS activity has been shown to be a major lifespan limiting factor in humans, C. elegans, and Drosophila. Finally, in addition to the factors discussed above, mitochondria regulate different signaling and metabolic pathways, including ROS production and therefore plays a vital role in aging progression.

However, the mechanisms by which TC reverses effects of aging through antioxidant activities have not been studied yet and remain to be further elucidated. To investigate the effects of TC extract (TCE) on aging and healthspan, we used the nematode C. elegans, which is an excellent model for aging research because of its short lifespan (2–3 weeks), experimental flexibility, and rapid turnover. Furthermore, C. elegans behavior and physiological activities slow down with age similar to that of higher mammals, including humans. Additionally, 83% of C. elegans proteome shows homology to the human proteome, and both humans and nematodes share significant age-related characteristics that can be used to study effects on health and aging.

Consistent with this finding, TCE regulated upstream and downstream genes related to DAF-16 pathway, reduced the activity of genes related to ROS, and increased oxygen consumption rate. Therefore, our findings reveal protective anti-aging effects of TCE in vivo with robust translational potential in humans due to the feasibility of incorporating TCE into a typical human diet. ",

Previous studies from our lab have shown that TC increased cell survival and antioxidant activity in vitro using adipocytes. Moreover, TC reduced toxic levels of ROS in both adipocytes and Zucker fatty rats. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have documented lifespan effects of TCE in mammalian and only one study has showed TCE effects in model organisms. Some studies have shown that TC improves memory, autophagy, and hippocampal inflammation in aged rats and protects against age-related bone loss in mice. Studies in C. elegans with blueberries (50, 100, and 200 mg/mL of extract) demonstrated increased MLS by 22.2%, 36.5%, and 44.4% and 5 mg/mL of blueberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10%. Similarly, cranberry extracts (2 mg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 32.5% and 20 mg/mL cranberry extracts extended MLS of Drosophila by 10%; purple wheat anthocyanins (100 μg/mL) increased MLS of C. elegans by 10.5%. In our study, we found that feeding C. elegans lower concentrations of TCE (3, 6, and 12 μg/mL) resulted in significant extension of MLS by 12.09% (p > 0.05), 26.44% (p < 0.05), and 25.69% (p < 0.05), respectively. These results are comparable to findings from the studies outlined above using other plant or fruit extracts. However, previous studies in C. elegans were done on agar plates, which require typically very high doses to get enough drug into the worms, as the drug can diffuse into the agar, and drug delivery is not efficient. Our cultures are in liquid environment due to microfluidics (NemaLife), which is a novel approach to culture worms with several advantages: worms can crawl in an optimized micropillar arena in liquid (unlike in agar plates) that improves drug delivery; during maintenance, sieve channels dispersed progeny, thus avoiding loss of adults; they can feed the adult-only population. Consistent with the advantages mentioned above, observation of lifespan-extension with low doses of TCE suggests that the microfluidic environments are efficient at drug delivery compared to agar plates.",

TCE did not increase lifespan in daf-16 mutant C. elegans, indicating that TCE may regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Further analysis of genes in WT worms also confirmed that TCE regulates lifespan mainly via DAF-16/IIS pathway, evident by significantly reduced expression of daf-2 and increased expression of daf-16 genes. Since both DAF-2 and DAF-16 in IIS pathway are highly conserved, our findings reveal the significant potential of TCE to promote healthy aging in humans. Although we did not see any changes of akt-1 and lin-14, two inhibitors of DAF-16, at mRNA levels, there are many other upstream pathways and downstream targets that we did not test. Thus, it is possible that TCE regulates upstream molecular targets of akt and lin-14, which merit further investigation, including those that control the expression of these genes such as pdk-1 and lin-4. SKN-1 is another transcription factor, which acts downstream of IIS pathway and showed reduced expression with reduced IIS signaling. We found that skn-1 gene expression was also upregulated by TCE treatments in WT worms. Our results are consistent with a recently published study using Hibiscus sabdariffa L. extracts which increased SKN-1 activity and prolonged lifespan in C. elegans. Studies have shown that cherries including sour cherry possess antimicrobial activity. We performed all our gene expression data in liquid CMEM media without bacteria supplementation and still observed increased expression of lifespan-related genes. However, in our current study, we did not measure anti-microbial activity of TCE on the OP50 bacteria which might account for part of calorie restriction-like effects on C. elegans to increase lifespan.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a fuel-sensing enzyme that negatively regulates fatty acid synthesis and positively regulates energy production pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid β-oxidation. Activation of AAK-2, homolog of AMPK in C. elegans physiologically (dietary restriction) or pharmacologically (resveratrol or metformin), increased lifespan of C. elegans. C. elegans has both aak-1 and aak-2, two different genes. The AMPKα1 subunit in C. elegans, AAK-2, is activated by AMP and involved in longevity. By contrast, AMPKα2 subunit, AAK-2, in C. elegans is not involved in longevity effects suggesting that AAK-2 is the subunit with kinase activity. Because of that, here, we evaluated the effects of TCE in aak-2 worm lifespan and aak-2 gene expression in WT worms. TCE did not change the MLS of aak-2 worms treated with TCE. Previous studies reported that aak-2 (ok524) mutants have a shorter lifespan (12%) than WT worms. In contrast to these findings, however, aak-2 (rb754) mutant worms we used for our lifespan assays did not show shorter average lifespan than WT worms, and aak-2 (rb754) had 17.8% increased lifespan than WT worms. The above reported study has been conducted on agar plates, while we used microfluidic devices for the lifespan assay and fed worms everyday with liquid OP50 mixed with TCE. Changes of the environment, use of microfluidic devices, and differences in the aak-2 strains used might be a potential cause for these discrepancies. Further genetic analysis in WT worms showed increased expression of aak-2 gene with TCE treatments. Possibly, activation of aak-2 increased fatty acid oxidation in WT worms, which may change total fatty acid composition in the worms and indirectly influence the lifespan of WT worms. However, these changes were not taking place in mutant aak2, which may affect their responses to TCE and changes in fatty acid composition or lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that TCE acts partly through AAK-2 pathway and requires DAF-16 and IIS pathways to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Sirtuins-1 (Sirt-1), an ortholog of mammalian yeast deacetylase Sir-2 linked to IIS signaling pathway, may also be involved in lifespan regulation and merits further investigation.",

            "text": "Mitochondria plays an important role in overall cellular and organism health. Mitochondria are involved in cellular metabolism, apoptosis, and production of ROS. It is thought that impaired mitochondria produce more ROS which causes cellular damage and leads to aging. SOD is an enzyme that is involved in detoxification and is found in cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. Experiments in yeast and mice showed that knocking out sod-1 and sod-2 decreased lifespan. In contrast, another study reported that SOD has no effect on lifespan in C. elegans. In our current study, sod-2 gene levels were increased with TCE, with no changes in sod-3 gene expression. Another study using purple pitanga fruit showed increased sod-3 protein expression in C. elegans. We chose sod-3 over sod-1 as they share some genetic similarities and have a certain level of amino acid homology, and sod-2 does not share substantial amino acid homology with either sod-1 or sod-3. Possibly, increased sod-2 gene expression in our study decreased mitochondrial ROS activity and extended lifespan. However, these findings remain to be confirmed using sod-2 mutant worms. Furthermore, to validate effects of TCE on ROS production, we plan in future to conduct additional functional assays to measure ROS, GSH/SG, and MDA levels. ",

            "text": "Ideal mitochondrial function is critical to have healthy cellular activity, and mitochondrial respiration is a strong indicator of good mitochondrial function. An age-related decline in oxidative phosphorylation can relate to reduced mitochondrial and nuclear expressed peptides functioning in the electron transport chain (ETC). Mitochondrial health can be measured by the rate of mitochondrial respiration in ETC. Moreover, alterations in the oxygen consumption rate are an indicator of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, decreased mitochondrial function reduces sufficient energy production, which plays key role during aging. In order to quantify the function of mitochondria, we assessed mitochondrial OCR by TCE treatments in WT C. elegans. Our data showed that TCE treated adult worms have significantly higher spare respiration capacity with 6 and 12 μg/mL concentrations. Spare respiratory capacity is the amount of additional ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation as a result of sudden increase in energy demand. Based on our findings, it is possible that increased expression of antioxidant genes, led to increased mitochondrial spare respiration by reducing ROS production and oxidative stress in part through sod-2.

            "text": "Another indicator of mitochondrial function is uncoupling proteins (UCPs). C. elegans expresses ucp-4. UCPs are highly conserved in many species, such as invertebrates, plants, and mammals. UCP-1 in mammals is induced by cold temperature and is a major player in thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Mammals express several other UCPs, which are involved in different functions other than thermogenesis. It is reported that non-thermogenic UCPs protect cells against oxidative stress. In support of these ideas, knocking down ucp-2 gene in mice generated more ROS than WT mice, and knocking down ucp-3 gene led to more ROS production in skeletal muscle. UCP-like protein in C. elegans is thoroughly related to ucp-4 in mammals, and the two proteins share 46% sequence identity. Here, we found that expression of ucp-4 was significantly higher in worms treated with 6 and 12 μg/mL TCE. Several studies documented that ucp-4 mutants may be involved in increased neuronal defects during aging, but none of the studies have reported lifespan extension effects of ucp-4 by reducing mitochondrial ROS production. Our findings suggest that reduced ROS production and increased mitochondrial function by TCE may be governed partially by increased ucp-4 expression.",

This may be mainly due to genetic regulation in IIS and DAF-16 pathway, partial involvement of AAK-2 signaling, increased antioxidant activity, and spare respiratory activity, allowing cells to function better under stressful conditions. Major underlying molecular targets are summarized in Figure 5, some of which require additional validations. Further studies are warranted to understand mechanisms linking oxidative stress, respiration, and longevity and their regulation by dietary antioxidants such as tart cherry anthocyanins. ",
