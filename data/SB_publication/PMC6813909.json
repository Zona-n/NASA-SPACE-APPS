            "text": "Bone can become brittle when exposed to ionizing radiation across a wide range of clinically relevant doses that span from radiotherapy (accumulative 50 Gy) to sterilization (~35,000 Gy). While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to a single x-ray radiation dose of either 0 (control), 50, 1,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, (p < 0.001) but at 50 and 1,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy. By contrast, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking was greater than control for all radiation doses (p < 0.001). All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.",

In vivo, radiotherapy treatment results in an accumulated localized dose of ~50 Gy1 in cancer patients. Ex vivo, bone allografts are sterilized at a dose of 30,000 ± 5,000 Gy. While these high-dose applications are critical for overall patient health and safety, high levels of ionizing radiation exposure have been shown to increase risk of fracture. For example, for women with anal, rectal or colon cancer, those treated with radiation therapy were more than three times as likely to suffer a pelvic fracture than those without radiation therapy. Furthermore, for patients with implanted bone allografts, allografts sterilized with radiation were twice as likely to fail compared to allografts sterilized using other methods. The increased risk of fracture clinically has led to research into the effect of high levels of ionizing radiation exposure on the mechanical and biochemical properties of bone.",

            "text": "Numerous ex vivo studies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that ionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure independent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties — ultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure — of irradiated bone has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure. Though the exact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, two mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved directly by x- and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. Second, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water molecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within collagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at what dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated with a number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each mechanism (i.e. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into applications of irradiation, and also aging and diabetes.",

First, we isolated the collagen via methods adapted from Burton et al. (see for details). In brief, L3 specimens were demineralized over 3 weeks in 0.5M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with the solution changed every 2–3 days. Demineralized specimens were defatted for 24-hours in a 1:1 solution of chloroform and methanol and then soaked in 100% methanol for another hour. Specimens were dried in a desiccator overnight, and then flash-frozen with liquid-nitrogen and crushed into bone powder using a mortar and pestle. Bone powder was then lyophilized (Sequence: −38°C for 180 minutes, −38°C at 120 mTorr for 90 minutes, −20°C at 770 mTorr for 900 minutes, −10 °C at 930 mTorr for 270 minutes, and 23°C at 120 mTorr for 55 minutes) (VirTis AdVantage Plus Benchtop Freeze Dryer XL Model, SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY). For tissue digestion, the powder was added to a solution of 0.5M acetic acid and pepsin (1mg of pepsin per 10 mg of bone powder) and placed on a rocker at 4°C for 72-hours. To neutralize the digestion process 5M NaOH was added until pH was neutral (pH = 6–8). To remove non-soluble collagen and non-collagenous proteins, samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant, containing the soluble collagen, was collected. To precipitate the collagen out of solution, solid NaCl was added to a final concentration of 2M NaCl and placed on a rocker at 4°C for 24-hours. Samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 200 uL of 0.5M acetic acid. Samples were then lyophilized and stored at −20°C until electrophoresis. In preparation for electrophoresis, the isolated collagen was dissolved in 1X PBS, mixed with additional reagents (Agilent Technologies Protein 230 Manual), and loaded on a bioanalyzer chip for automated electrophoresis. Rat-tail collagen (Sigma Aldrich, C7661–25MG) was run as a standard. From this assay, the distribution of molecular weights of the collagen protein was assessed in two ways: (1) visually with a software-generated “gel” and (2) quantitatively with a software-generated fluorescence unit (FU) chart, called an “electropherogram” (Agilent 2100 Expert software). The nominal size of a type-I collagen, either alpha-1 or alpha-2, is between 130–150 kDa. To identify chain fragmentation, we looked for evidence of less protein in this range, and a wider distribution of molecular weights. On the gel, this was observed as a lighter-colored band or smeared band at ~150 kDa. On the electropherogram, fragmentation can be observed when the peak at ~150 kDa is diminished, indicating fewer fluorescence units and therefore fewer collagen chains of the nominal size.

In accordance with previous investigations of cortical bone, we observed a reduction in both monotonic and fatigue properties at a dose equivalent to nominal allograft sterilization of ~30,000 ± 5,000 Gy, and a reduction of monotonic strength at 17,000 Gy. While our study is consistent with earlier observations, our findings expand upon previous knowledge in three important areas. First, previous inquiries have been conducted on either cortical or trabecular bone tissue specimens, not whole-bones. Second, mechanical characterization has been primarily conducted in either monotonic or fatigue loading conditions, not both. Finally, only a subset of these studies has conducted concurrent collagen biochemical analysis, quantifying either crosslinks or fragmentation. For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones (with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across a spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (i.e. radiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and fatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. We expand on the work of Currey et al. and demonstrate that in addition to a reduction in monotonic strength following irradiation at 17,000 Gy, fatigue properties are also significantly reduced. Importantly, we have demonstrated the doses at which the differences in collagen structure and mechanics arise. Our results provide new insight into the type of molecular change driving the degradation of whole-bone strength and fatigue life following irradiation.",

While no previous studies have quantified the fragmentation of collagen in irradiated whole-bones, our results are in agreement with previous work on cortical bone, which demonstrated that diminished fracture toughness at doses of ~35,000 Gy was a result of collagen fragmentation. Expanding on this knowledge, we demonstrate that collagen fragmentation leads to degraded murine whole-bone mechanics at 17,000 Gy, a dose signifiantly lower than the standard for allograft sterilization (25,000 – 35,000 Gy).

Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging, drug treatments, irradiation sterilization, and diseases such as osteoporosis and diabetes. While the concentration of non-enzymatic crosslinks does accumulate in bone collagen in these applications, any causation of those crosslinks with respect to degraded mechanical properties has not been established. Here, we observed that despite a substantial (95%) increase in crosslink concentration, we could not detect any effect on vertebral strength. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that an increase in non-enzymatic crosslinks induced via ribose incubation can be used to counter the loss of strength due to the fragmentation of the collagen network, not degrade it further. Taken together, our results strengthen the argument that the contribution of non-enzymatic crosslinks to diminished bone strength with disease and aging plays a smaller role in comparison to other factors, such as collagen network connectivity.",

However, as discussed above, similar trends in irradiation-induced degraded bone strength and molecular-level changes have been seen in other studies across a number of anatomic sites and species, including human bone. That consistency suggests our results are not limited to murine bone. Second, as an ex vivo study, we excluded the impact of any biologically induced responses to radiation in order to explore the extent to which radiation directly alters the mechanical behavior of the bone matrix. For applications of allograft sterilization, which are only conducted ex vivo, excluding cellular effects is appropriate. However, for in vivo applications of radiation therapy, there can be cellular-driven changes, such as reduced bone volume fraction or altered trabecular microarchitecture, which can alter bone mechanics beyond what is reported here. Thus, our method of irradiation is directly comparable to ex vivo allograft sterilization; for doses equivalent to in vivo radiotherapy treatment (50 Gy), our method is only applicable when considering the direct effects of radiation on the bone matrix. Additionally, we performed all mechanical tests, monotonic and cyclic, in compression. While compressive loading is most relevant for in vivo behavior, the response may be different for isolated specimens tested in pure tension.",

To address this gap, we conducted a post-hoc study for doses of 5,000 and 10,000 Gy (see Appendix) with the same mechanical and biochemical assays described above. We found some mechanical differences occurred with radiation exposure of 5,000 Gy (and above), but only for cyclic loading: compared to the control, fatigue life was lower by 18% (p < 0.01) but monotonic strength was not different (p = 0.12). These ad hoc results confirm previous observations that cyclic loading may be a more sensitive test than monotonic loading for detecting mechanical effects of radiation. Clinically, radiation-induced fractures are often observed months to years after irradiation and classified as spontaneous or insufficiency fractures (i.e. fractures which are not the result of a fall or trauma, and more likely due to repetitive loading at low forces over time). As such, it is clinically important to consider mechanisms that can affect cyclic loading properties differently than static loading properties.

However, our supplemental findings suggest collagen fragmentation and associated loss of cyclic mechanical properties can begin with a dose as low as 5,000 Gy (see Appendix). To mitigate the loss of mechanical integrity, further studies are needed to investigate how to safeguard the bone with a radioprotectant. Several radioprotectants have been considered for their ability to preserve tissue properties following irradiation. Based on our results, we would recommend studies focused on radioprotectants which can prevent or offset the fragmentation of collagen, as these types of radioprotectants may preserve bone mechanics to a greater degree than those which protect against non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks.",

Thus, direct effects of radiation on the collagen matrix from radiation therapy are not solely responsible for the increased fracture risk observed clinically. From this, we can infer that the cellular processes of bone remodeling due to in vivo irradiation are likely the root cause. Indeed, previous in vivo irradiation studies of bone in a murine model have shown reduced trabecular bone mass, number and connectivity associated with hyperactive osteoclast activity. Taken together with our ex vivo observations, cell-mediated changes in bone quantity, trabecular microarchitecture, or tissue material quality are more plausible explanations for the increased fracture risk from radiation therapy than direct changes to the bone material.",

            "text": "To gain insight into the effect of ionizing radiation between 1,000 and 17,000 Gy, we conducted an additional ex vivo x-ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae from 20-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice, randomly assigned to a one-time ex vivo radiation dose of either 0 (n = 4), 5,000 (n = 5), or 10,000 Gy (n = 5). As detailed above, we measured mechanical properties, collagen crosslinks, and collagen fragmentation (data not shown). We observed compressive fatigue life to be lower for the irradiated groups, being 18% (p < 0.01) and 37% (p < 0.0001) lower for 5,000 and 10,000 Gy doses, respectively, compared to the control (5.0 ± 0.4 log(cycles)). We detected no significant effect of radiation dose for any of the compressive monotonic mechanical properties, either for strength (p = 0.12), stiffness (p = 0.62), or maximum displacement (p = 0.51). Collagen crosslinks increased significantly for all irradiated groups, by 71% and 101% for 5,000 and 10,000 Gy, respectively (p < 0.05). Collagen fragmentation was evident for 5,000 Gy, observed as a significant decrease in the amount of nominally sized collagen chains (~150 kDa) compared to the 0 Gy control (p = 0.008); data for the 10,000 Gy group was lost due to a processing error. These findings suggest that doses well below sterilization standards (30,000 ± 5,000 Gy) and a proposed alternative (11,000 Gy) may compromise the mechanical strength and collagen integrity of bone allografts, making them more susceptible to failure under cyclic loading.",
