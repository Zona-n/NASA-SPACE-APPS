            "text": "Although heat and desiccation stresses often coincide, the response to heat especially in desiccation tolerant plants is rarely studied. We subjected hydrated Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds to temperatures up to 50°C and dehydrated fronds up to 65°C for 24 h. The effect of heat stress was evaluated using morphological changes, photosystem (PS) II efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Pinnae of dried fronds exposed to more than 40°C curled tighter and became brittle compared to fronds dried at lower temperatures. Exposure to > 50°C leads to discolored fronds after rehydration. Hydrated fronds turned partially brown at > 35°C. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Ft) and quantum yield (Qy) increased following re-hydration but the recovery process after 40°C treatment lasted longer than at lower temperatures. Similarly, hydrated fronds showed reduced Qy when exposed to > 40°C. Dried and hydrated fronds remained metabolically active up to 40°C. Hydroperoxides and lipid hydroperoxides in dried samples remained high up to 50°C, but decreased in hydrated fronds at > 40°C. Catalase (CAT) and glutathione (GSH) oxidizing activities remained high up to 40°C in dehydrated fronds and up to 35°C in hydrated fronds. Major fatty acids detected in both dehydrated and hydrated fronds included palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids, oleic (18:1), linoleic (C18:2); and linolenic (C18:3) acids. Linolenic acid was most abundant. In dried fronds, all fatty acids decreased at > 35°C. The combined data indicate that the thermotolerance of dry fronds is about 55°C but is at least 10°C lower for hydrated fronds.",

            "text": "Heat stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting plant growth, yield, and productivity. Temperatures beyond the “physiological capacity” of plants have debilitating effects on biochemical processes, cellular homeostasis, changes in enzyme activities, photosynthesis, protein synthesis, and membrane fluidity. Damage to photosystem (PS) II and associated proteins is reported to be a primary target of high temperature stress. Heat stress uncouples electron transport activity, ATP synthesis and variable (Fv), and maximum (Fm) chlorophyll fluorescence, which results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as singlet oxygen, superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals, all of which induce oxidative stress. Furthermore, heat stress affects activity of the antioxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants like ascorbic acid and glutathione (GSH), which change in response to heat stress.",

            "text": "Plants not only experience heat- but also desiccation stress, which stems from loss of water via evapotranspiration. Distinguishing combined stresses is difficult because many of the physiological and molecular responses between these stresses overlap. Some studies suggest that the combination of these two stresses is more deleterious to plant growth and productivity than each individual stress and the response to combined stresses cannot be extrapolated from the individual stress. Therefore, studies typically report the combined effects of heat and drought stress. However, this approach obscures the individual stress response. Additionally, separating heat from desiccation stress is not possible in the field and difficult to establish even under laboratory conditions but leads to meaningful characterization of the metabolic response to individual stressors.",

            "text": "Plants that are especially well-suited to study desiccation stress are “resurrection” plants. These plants are defined by their vegetative tissues being able to sustain desiccation to water potentials as low as −100 MPa. They can reach complete air dryness and rehydrate without suffering noticeable injury. Because these plants can sustain desiccation and attain certain levels of quiescence during this process, their heat tolerance can be tested in dry and hydrated conditions. A large body of research has reported thermotolerance capacity of non-vascular, poikilohydric species such as bryophytes and lichens. Although thermo and frost resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes and heat resistance of desiccation tolerant pteridophytes and angiosperms was examined, there is no information on biochemical responses of these plants to elevated temperatures. Based on morphological and photosynthetic responses, there is general consensus that non-vascular and vascular plants show increased thermotolerance after desiccation. However, the dependency on seasonal conditions also indicates that desiccation alone is insufficient to establish thermotolerance. To dissect the biochemical responses to heat and desiccation, we studied the response of the desiccation tolerant fern Pleopletis polypodioides in dry and hydrated fronds. Because pteridophytes are widely distributed and successfully established in various environments, they not only provide essential information on the evolution of desiccation tolerance but also serve an excellent model to study the effects of heat stress.",

In response to dehydration, the ventral surface curls inward and the dorsal surface, covered with peltate scales, remains exposed. Such folding mechanisms, also demonstrated by other resurrection plants, are thought to be a defensive mechanism against photooxidation. Although there is plenty of information on morphological changes of plants in response to heat and desiccation stress, adaptations of ferns to desiccation, and biochemical response to drought are limited. In addition, the response of Pleopeltis to heat has not been investigated.",

F0 was measured by applying a light pulse (455 nm of 0.09 μmoles m–2s–1 for 30 μs) and recorded as Ft. Similarly, Qy measurements were obtained by applying a saturating light that measures maximum value of fluorescence (Fm) from PS II (approximately 3000 μmol m–2 s–1 for 0.8 s) to dark-adapted dry fronds and dim-light (∼10 μM m–2 s–1) exposed fronds. Preliminary measurements showed no difference between dark or dim-light adapted measurements. The difference between minimal fluorescence F0 and maximal fluorescence Fm divided by Fm, i.e., (Fm-F0)/Fm. We used this ratio to describe quantum yield (Qy) of PS II system.

However, treatment of ≥ 40°C strongly increased the conductivity of fully and partly submersed fronds, indicating membrane leakiness (Figure 4).

The problematic aspects include the duration of the temperature treatment and the testing of various processes and enzymatic activities. It is unlikely that in nature temperatures greater than 40°C extend for more than 12 h. Nonetheless, heat tolerance was tested previously for an equally arbitrary time of 30 min, which resulted in tolerance of > 100°C. While evaporative cooling likely provides some protection during short-term heat exposure, our heat treatments of 24 h exceeds naturally occurring conditions but provides enough time to assess metabolic responses. Similarly, submersion of fronds eliminates water stress but may cause different stress for the epiphytic Pleopletis as was shown by the lower reducing capacity (Figure 6) and reduced Qy (Figure 3F) of completely vs. partially submersed fronds (Figure 3D). This sensitivity may be the result of reduced gas exchange, or the enhanced activity of symbiotic surface organisms; both phenomena can lead to anoxia. Nonetheless, the differences between the submersion treatments illustrate the sensitivity of the fronds to different conditions and allow for nuanced evaluation of heat effects.",

These changes possibly indicate glass transition, which facilitates survival in ferns spores. Among the cell wall polymers, pectin affects the elasticity of the cell wall and heat sensitivity. Loss of pectin functionality leads to increased cell wall porosity, brittleness, and conductive evaporation. Pectin arrangements are likely modified in response to the combination of drying and elevated temperatures, but further research is needed to assess the status of pectin in the cell wall of dried Pleopeltis fronds.

One of the key enzymes known to regulate the breakdown of chlorophyll is pheophytinase. It is possible that the activity of this enzyme increases at high temperatures, similar to observations in bentgrass. Stress-induced chlorophyll degradation is also affected by ethylene, abscisic acid, cytokinin, and ROS. These compounds also influence PS II-mediated electron transport, and membrane-bound ion channels, proteins, and lipids.

This disruption likely protects the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage. Interestingly, after exposure to 65°C, Ft was higher than after 60°C exposure or in non-heat-treated, dry fronds (Figure 3A), suggesting that extreme temperatures (i.e., 65°C) lead to the disintegration of the photosynthetic reaction center but chlorophyll fluorescence persists. Thus, based on the Ft and Qy data, the photosynthetic apparatus in dry fronds is heat-tolerant up to 60°C. The photosynthetic apparatus adjusts to stress in several ways, including elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which can lead to increases in Zeaxanthin and other pigments even under dark conditions and ROS.

Qy values of fronds exposed to 30°C reached control values within 5 h of re-hydration but required at least 24 h in fronds exposed to higher temperatures (Figure 3B). The slow recovery of Qy performance indicates that heat exerts long-term stress on the PS II system, likely by interfering with the water oxidation complex and/or PS II energy transfer. Fronds re-hydrated after 60°C appeared photosynthetically functional but at significantly reduced efficiency (Figures 3A,B), which suggests that repair processes are damaged. Photosynthetic activity (Qy) in re-hydrated fronds after 65°C was not detectable (Figure 3B), and indicates irreversible damage. Thus, similar to morphological data, Ft and Qy measurements indicate that the maximal heat tolerance of dehydrated Pleopeltis is 60°C.

Low conductivity in partly and fully submersed samples at ≤ 35°C and no difference from the control likely represents regular ion exchange in intact membranes that is maintained until about 35°C (Figure 4A). During the ensuing 24 h recovery period, the (slight) decrease in conductivity suggests at least partial reuptake of ions (Figure 4B).

Additionally, since Pleopeltis fronds readily absorb water, it is likely that water permeability contributes to ion loss. The higher quantity of ions in the leachate (Figure 5) and high conductivity (Figure 4) in fully submersed samples compared to partly submersed samples is likely proportional to the extent a submersion but indicates the deleterious effect of heat on membrane stability. The most abundant ion found in the leachate was K+ (Figure 5) consistent with its vital role in the osmoregulation.

Nonetheless, the temperature and hydration variability of the data indicates that the measurements provide a meaningful estimate of the reduction capacity. The declining reducing capacity with increasing temperatures (Figure 6) is likely the result of diminished electron transport and uncoupled photosynthetic electron transport. Because metabolic activity of dried fronds was detectable, dehydrated Pleopeltis remain metabolically active up to at 40°C (Figure 6). Metabolic changes in desiccated moss tissue resulted in a glassy state only after rapid desiccation where enzymatic reactions were absent. In contrast, slow drying achieved a “rubbery state”.

Apoptosis or PCD is typically estimated by the loss of metabolic functions (as in Figure 6) and characterized by cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and breakup of a cell into small apoptotic bodies. In contrast, necrosis is characterized as a chaotic and uncontrolled form of cell death that involves early rupture of the plasma membrane and confined swelling of the cell.

CAT, an important enzyme for the detoxification of H2O2, is sensitive to elevated temperatures (Figure 9) and has been reported to decline upon dehydration. The heat correlated reduction of CAT activity suggests that CAT is unable to detoxify ROS as also reported by. Reduced CAT activity and high amounts of hydroperoxides may lead to an oxidative environment that then enhances consumption of GSH, a phenomenon also observed in Arabidopsis and barley mutants that lack CAT activity. GSH-oxidation increases during dehydration and heat-stressed, dried fronds maintain their high GSH levels up to 40°C (Figure 10). Thus, GSH oxidizing enzymes have greater heat tolerance than CAT. It is also possible that the accumulation of the oxidized form of GSH (GSSG) in chloroplasts and vacuoles is important for redox regulation, especially during stress.",

However, unlike bentgrass which showed increased lipid peroxide and electrolyte leakage, Pleopeltis exhibited increased electrolyte leakage (Figure 4) but LOOH content decreased at > 40°C (Figure 8), which could result from interactions between peroxide (Figure 7) and membrane-bound unsaturated fatty acids (Figures 11B,C).

Our data confirm this notion because the FA composition of Pleopeltis fronds changes with temperature and hydration (Figure 11). Increasing temperature reduces desaturation and overall FA quantity, which indicates that heat interferes with either fatty acid synthesis and/or stimulates fatty acid breakdown. On average, the relative proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in dried fronds was higher than in hydrated fronds (Supplementary Table 1), which may protect the temperature sensitive photosynthetic apparatus. Additionally, unsaturation declined in dried fronds at temperatures > 40 and > 35°C in hydrated fronds (Figure 11), suggesting that heat stress increases saturation of fatty acids. Saturated FAs reduce membrane fluidity and enhance integrity. Both parameters are important for surviving high temperatures. Additionally, the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acid makes membranes susceptible to peroxidation, which corresponds to our observation of higher LOOH in heat-stressed, dry fronds compared with hydrated fronds (Figure 8). Although saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 18:0) made up a small fraction of the total fatty acid pool (Figure 11), their presence likely contributes to membrane stability and heat tolerance.",

Even though senescence is not detectable in dried fronds, high amounts of lipid hydroperoxides (Figure 8) imply that dehydrated fronds are also affected by heat-induced membrane damage. The sensitivity of FA spectra to temperature and hydration indicates that FA profiling can be an effective stress indicator. Future studies will decipher how the FA profile changes with the extent and duration of stress, and during recovery. Dried material undergoes metabolic reactions of lipids and longevity has been attributed to “differences in the structure or mobility of molecules within the solidified cytoplasm”. The remaining elasticity of dried Pleopeltis fronds suggests that they are below the glass transition threshold and therefore capable of low-level metabolism. The changing levels of FAs are indicative of ongoing metabolism in tissue with low water content (Figure 11). One could speculate that the stress response to drying includes enhanced lipid biosynthesis to maintain membrane fluidity and that elevated temperatures enhance respiration such that beta oxidation of FAs leads to their lowered content. Future studies will analyze the time course of these rather drastic changes, and how the FA profile changes during recovery.",
