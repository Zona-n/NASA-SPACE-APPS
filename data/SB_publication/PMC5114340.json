Here, we applied 3wk of hindlimb unloading followed by 3wk of reambulation to a genetically heterogeneous population of 352 adult mice and tested the hypothesis that changes in muscle are associated with changes in bone at the level of the tissue and the genome. During unloading and relative to normally ambulating control mice, most mice lost muscle and cortical bone with large variability across the population. During reambulation, individual mice regained bone and muscle at different rates. Across mice, changes in muscle and trabecular/cortical bone were not correlated to each other during unloading or reambulation. For unloading, we found one significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) for muscle area and five QTLs for cortical bone without overlap between mechano-sensitive muscle and cortical bone QTLs (but some overlap between muscle and trabecular QTLs). The low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response indicate that the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-adjusts its size during (un)loading may need to be reassessed.",

Both cortical and trabecular bone have been included in muscle-bone correlations but it is unclear which type of bone is more highly associated with muscle strength.",

Exercise induces a highly site-specific mechanical environment in the skeleton, yet high correlations between muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) span distant sites in the skeleton. Thus, an association between muscle and bone may be more global than peak muscle forces locally altering bone (re)modeling at the specific anatomical site at which they act.",

While such a sequential relationship has been observed using two-dimensional DXA, three-dimensional CT data show that bone mineral accrual may cease before peak muscle strength is reached. At the other end of the spectrum, age-related sarcopenia reduces muscle loading of bone and, therefore, should induce bone loss. Contrary to the proposed functional muscle-bone relationship, substantial bone loss can precede equivalently detectable losses in muscle by nearly a decade.",

The drastic changes in the mechanical environment associated with unloading and reambulation of the musculoskeleton during spaceflight, bedrest, or injury/disease provide a model system to further test muscle-bone interactions. Reflecting the high sensitivity of the musculoskeleton to mechanical signals, unloading causes both sarcopenia and osteopenia in humans and animal models while reambulation recovers, at least in part, these losses. Further, differences in genetic make-up between individuals, humans or mice, have been shown to greatly influence the magnitude of the skeletal response to unloading and reambulation, providing an opportunity to relate intra-individual differences in musculoskeletal adaptation across a wide phenotypic range.",

While molecular interactions have recently received considerable attention, much less is known about the genes that determine differences in musculoskeletal sensitivity to mechanical signals based on an individual’s genetic make-up. For trabecular bone, we have identified specific regions on chromosomes that harbor regulatory genes (quantitative trait loci or QTL) explaining the variability in bone’s response to unloading and reambulation across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. QTLs that regulate the susceptibility of cortical bone and muscle to unloading and subsequent reambulation are yet to be identified.

A total of 352 mice completed both unloading and reambulation protocols.

There is no evidence that radiation at the prescribed levels influenced the tissue level response. The analyzed region for mid-diaphyseal cortical bone was determined as a 2.1mm long region in axial direction centered at 50% of femoral length. Mid-diaphyseal cortical bone morphology was evaluated for cortical area (Ct.Ar), marrow area (Ma.Ar), and tissue mineral density (TMD) with sigma, support, and threshold values of 0.6, 1, and 220. The combined cross-sectional area of muscle groups (Mu.Ar) surrounding a 700µm long region centered at 50% of femoral length was determined using sigma, support and threshold values of 0.9, 1, and 71 (Figure 1). Total cortical area was subtracted from the total muscle area. For each mouse, any given muscle and bone µCT index was determined for the left and right leg and averaged into a single value. The first 81 mice were not included in the muscle unloading analysis because we used a µCT ROI for these mice that did not capture the entire muscle group, resulting in n=384 for changes in Mu.Ar during unloading (vs n=464 for cortical variables).

In contrast to this hypothesis, the magnitude of the response of the two tissues to unloading and reambulation was not correlated across a genetically heterogeneous mouse population. This lack of coordination between muscle and bone at the tissue level was somewhat similar at the genetic level. The strong QTL for changes in muscle area during unloading on chromosome 5 did not overlap with any QTLs for changes in cortical bone properties but shared a common region for some trabecular properties. While these data emphasize the strong influence of genetic variations on the response of both skeletal muscle and bone, the low correlations between morphological changes in muscle and bone, together with the largely distinct genetic regulation of the response, are inconsistent with the premise of a muscle-bone unit that co-regulates its size during mechanical challenges.",

First, we did not measure changes in muscle strength but muscle cross-sectional area as a surrogate measure of strength is well accepted in clinical and animal studies. Second, we chose the composite cross-sectional muscle area of several individual muscles as we assumed that the forces exerted by these muscles are primarily responsible for inducing bone strains in the diaphysis (and metaphysis) of the mouse femur and because the µCT images did not allow for separation into distinct muscle groups. Third, we observed musculoskeletal changes in unloading and reambulation over a 3wk period each, a duration that significantly altered musculo-skeletal variables at the mouse femur during both unloading and reambulation but it is conceivable that time periods of different length would influence our results and conclusions. Using the initial adaptive changes in both tissues upon application of a new mechanical environment ostensibly provided the largest signals for the correlations and should have also minimized the limitation that changes in muscle and bone were quantified simultaneously, rather than sequentially with muscle measurements preceding bone measurements. Lastly, QTL studies have many strengths including the absence of assumptions regarding genes and molecular pathways giving rise to the trait of interest. Conversely, the identification of causative genes from the identified QTLs typically requires substantial effort as QTLs can contain several hundred candidate genes and we are currently pursuing a combined bioinformatic/transgenic mouse approach towards this critical goal.",

While we don’t know the reason for this pattern, it is conceivable that specific combinations of polymorphisms caused the tissue response of these mice go into the opposite direction from what we would have expected. This is plausible because by breeding a F2 population, it is likely that some mice will have a phenotype well beyond the expected boundaries set by the two progenitor inbred strains. Because of the small number of mice displaying the opposite response pattern, no underlying QTLs could be determined. Inherently, it is also possible that noise in the data measurements contributed to this phenomenon. If it was true that combinations of polymorphisms cannot only prevent the catabolic response associated with unloading but can even produce a mild anabolic response, the identification of these polymorphisms may give rise to novel countermeasures.",

Many of these studies were cross-sectional in nature, precluding mechanistic inferences. Some longitudinal studies in mice have proposed functional relationships between changes in bone and muscle during (un)loading but they were limited to temporal relations in a single inbred strain of mice. That our longitudinal study, taking advantage of a large sample of mice with greatly different mechano-responsivities, was not able to provide evidence for a mechanism by which changes in muscle size modulate changes in bone size should not be entirely surprising. Astronauts suffer from sarcopenia and ostepenia in space but the temporal patterns of muscle and bone loss are not suggestive of a causal relation; similar to paraplegia and bedrest, bone loss continues even as loss in muscle mass plateaus. Furthermore, individuals who lose the greatest amount of bone during bedrest do not coincide with those who experience the greatest amount of loss in muscle mass. Also consistent with our results, there is no influence of the levels of activity (i.e., mechanical forces) on the recovery of bone mass during reambulation in mice. Together, these studies suggest that the hypothesis of bone mass calibrated to altered levels of muscle cross-sectional area is not generally applicable.",

By extension, they also provide evidence that the relatively few, large-magnitude muscle contractions arising during daily weightbearing activities are unlikely to dominate skeletal adaptation. Further, in light of the distinct genetic mechano-regulation of the two tissues, it could be speculated that the development of mechanical interventions for musculoskeletal ailments may have to be optimized independently for bone and muscle. Regardless, our results emphasize that much work is required for a complete understanding of the mechanisms by which muscle and bone interact with each other while exposed to altered levels of weightbearing and that genetics is a variable that needs to be considered in these interactions.",
