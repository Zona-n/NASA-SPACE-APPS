            "text": "To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na+/K+-ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.",

Coronavirus is expected to infect up to 70% of the world’s population and kill millions of people. To date, the main public health strategy for limiting mortality, to reduce exposure to the virus via physical distancing, carries tremendous economic costs and may create COVID-19 disparities, as not everyone can telecommute for work or afford to shelter in place. The main treatment strategy for limiting mortality involves ventilators, which may not be available and accessible in adequate quantities. To address need for strategies that are less costly, more equitable, and more accessible, this paper describes potential causal paths from sub-optimal hydration before COVID-19 infection to increased morbidity and mortality. The hypothesized mechanisms suggest potential for free or low-cost, globally applicable drinking water interventions and hydration-informed treatment (e.g. hypertonic resuscitation) to limit COVID-19 mortality.",

The prevalence of hypertonicity in non-acutely ill US adults ages 51–70 years who have obesity, high waist circumference, insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, dyslipidemia, hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome is 73%, compared to 56% among individuals without any of the listed conditions, in the same age group. Systematic review of observational studies suggests that hypernatremia is consistently associated with metabolic syndrome. Animal models and observational studies implicate hypertonicity and the vasopressin-hydration system in the etiology of chronic kidney disease. Hypovolemia is an established risk factor for renal failure in the ICU.",

In T cells, hypertonic conditions activate NFAT5, which upregulates TNF-alpha alongside increased expression of osmoprotective genes. High salt conditions promote the differentiation of CD4+ helper T cells into IL17-producing CD4+ helper T cells (TH17 cells), via p38 MAPK and NFAT5, as well as serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1)-dependent signaling. In vitro hypertonicity or in vivo high salt diet also impair the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), that normally counteract the effects of Th17 cells, by increasing the SGK1-mediated production of interferon gamma and inducing a TH1 phenotype (TH1-like Tregs). Th17 cells are involved in inflammation and drive autoimmune diseases in animal models. Induced activation of Th17 cells results in ARDS in mice.",

After a baseline period, the Adapt study induced increases in drinking water of 1L/d or more above baseline, which were sustained for 4 weeks. Saliva, blood and body weight were measured each week. Each week, saliva and blood were collected 60 min after a 750 ml bolus of drinking water following overnight food and water restriction. The saliva and blood results in this table thus reflect status in the hour after an acute hypotonic challenge, at baseline and after 4 weeks of sustained higher water intake. SGK1: Human SGK1 gene expression analysis by qPCR. Total RNA from human whole blood was isolated using PAXgene Blood miRNA extraction kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were estimated by Nanodrop. Equal amounts of RNA were retro-transcribed to cDNA using cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resultant cDNA was used as template in quantitative PCR reactions containing SYBR-green fluorescent dye (Bio-Rad). Human SGK1 relative expression levels were calculated using the 2^-delta Ct method. Human actin (hActin) expression was used for SGK1 normalization. Target primer (5′-3′) sequences for SGK1 were TTC TCT TTC CAG ACT GCT GA and TGG ATG TTG TGC TGT TGT GT and for hActin: CAC CAA CTG GGA CGA CAT and ACA GCC TGG ATA GCA ACG. Plasma VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor was determined by MyBiosource ELISA No. MBS2886894 by ProNovus Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA. RBC GPX: Red blood cell glutathione peroxidase was determined by assay No.703102, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.
