            "text": "Caenorhabditis elegans is a low-cost genetic model that has been flown to the International Space Station to investigate the influence of microgravity on changes in the expression of genes involved in muscle maintenance. These studies showed that genes that encode muscle attachment complexes have decreased expression under microgravity. However, it remains to be answered whether the decreased expression leads to concomitant changes in animal muscle strength, specifically across multiple generations. We recently reported the NemaFlex microfluidic device for the measurement of muscle strength of C. elegans (Rahman et al., Lab Chip, 2018). In this study, we redesign our original NemaFlex device and integrate it with flow control hardware for spaceflight investigations considering mixed animal culture, constraints on astronaut time, crew safety, and on-orbit operations. The technical advances we have made include (i) a microfluidic device design that allows animals of a given size to be sorted from unsynchronized cultures and housed in individual chambers, (ii) a fluid handling protocol for injecting the suspension of animals into the microfluidic device that prevents channel clogging, introduction of bubbles, and crowding of animals in the chambers, and (iii) a custom-built worm-loading apparatus interfaced with the microfluidic device that allows easy manipulation of the worm suspension and prevents fluid leakage into the surrounding environment. Collectively, these technical advances enabled the development of new microfluidics-integrated hardware for spaceflight studies in C. elegans. Finally, we report Earth-based validation studies to test this new hardware, which has led to it being flown to the International Space Station.",

The postural muscles are most affected in the microgravity environment, therefore, impacting the activities of astronauts in long-duration spaceflight missions. Even a weeklong stay at the International Space Station (ISS) can lead to degradation in muscle mass and peak power; this loss could be fatal in off-nominal landing scenarios where assistance might be unavailable. Loss of muscle strength can pose an even more serious problem for interplanetary travel, such as with a venture to Mars, which could take 200 to 300 days.",

            "text": "Generally, reduced workload in a microgravity environment is considered to be a primary cause of muscle loss in response to spaceflight. However, altered metabolism also plays a significant role. For example, atrophy in flight is not limited to antigravity muscles but also occurs in vascular smooth muscles and cardiac muscles. To combat muscular atrophy, astronauts exercise (aerobic and resistance) for up to 2.5 h each day. Even with these current countermeasures, the loss in muscle mass is up to 20% during a 5-day to 2-week-long flight, whereas for a long-duration space mission (3 to 6 months), a loss of 30% is noted. In most cases, muscle mass and strength can be regained within a few months to years after returning to Earth by a combination of adapted exercise and rehabilitation. Nevertheless, muscle maintenance in space is still a major concern, and no effective preventive measures exist beyond the limited benefit obtained through exercise. Thus, it is important to determine the mechanisms responsible for the loss of muscle strength in spaceflight and develop appropriate countermeasures.",

These similarities provide strong motivation for investigating the effect of spaceflight conditions on muscles using invertebrate animal models, thus avoiding the cost and time expense associated with experiments using vertebrates.

Up to 40% of its genes are homologous to human genes, and a large library of genetic mutants and strains with fluorescent reporters are available. The body wall muscles of C. elegans are functionally analogous to vertebrate muscle, as they include dense bodies and M-lines, the former being functionally equivalent to vertebrate Z-lines. In addition, the nematode is small (≈1 mm), weight is miniscule (≈1 μg), has a short lifespan (≈20 days), fast generation time (∼1 week), and is easy to grow. For spaceflight missions where payload size and weight are critical considerations, C. elegans experimental payloads offer a small form factor and a significant reduction in weight compared with vertebrates. Moreover, the fast reproductive cycle enables multi-generational studies to be conducted, providing an opportunity to explore physiological adaptations due to long-term habitation in space. These advantages and existing strain resources make C. elegans a leading invertebrate animal model for spaceflight studies.",

In microgravity, gravitational effects are significantly weaker, which alters C. elegans physiology. In prior spaceflight experiments with C. elegans, it was found that approximately 150 muscle genes were downregulated in C. elegans during 10 days of culture in microgravity. Among the detected downregulated muscle genes were key motor protein genes such as MyoD and myosin heavy chain, and two genes (unc-97 and unc-112) that encode members of a muscle attachment complex. Members of the attachment complex (called the costamere in humans) have been shown in humans to increase expression and activity with increased mechanical load and decrease expression and activity in response to immobilization. Thus, muscle attachment genes play an important role in processes leading to muscle loss. In C. elegans on Earth, decreased expression of these genes via acute RNAi treatments results in movement defects and various subcellular defects within the muscle (e.g., disorganization and collapse of arrayed sarcomeres).",

While decreased force production is documented for astronauts, it is yet to be demonstrated for C. elegans cultured in microgravity. Several studies have used elastomeric micropillars to measure muscle forces in C. elegans, and we have recently standardized a microfluidic device and approach for obtaining the maximum exertable force, providing a measure of nematode muscle strength. This strength measurement apparatus is called NemaFlex and consists of a microfluidic chamber with microfabricated deformable pillars. The force produced by a nematode moving between the pillars is evaluated from the pillar deflections observed under a microscope. The NemaFlex device and the force measurement protocol have been optimized such that muscle strength is independent of behavior and gait. The device is also capable of detecting strength differences in mutants with defects in muscle genes. The NemaFlex device is miniaturized and simple to use, and thus has potential for C. elegans spaceflight experiments.",

Addressing these technical challenges, we report a reconfigured spaceflight ready NemaFlex device (referred to as NemaFlex-S), new protocols for experimentation with C. elegans, and a custom-designed hardware for on-orbit operation of NemaFlex-S on the ISS. This integrated technology and protocols enabled its successful operation by astronauts on the ISS producing significant visual data of C. elegans across multiple generations.",

In recent years efforts have been made in studying the behavior of C. elegans in longitudinal chips, worms were loaded automatically into these chips. Prior literature provides design guidance on how to house individual C. elegans in microfluidic chambers, however, these devices do not meet the needs of multigenerational space-flight studies. For example, Chung et al. and Le et al. designed a microfluidic device that had an array of connected chambers with tapered necks for individual animals to enter and be housed. Although these devices can successfully house individual animals, they were optimized for age-synchronized animals and not for mixed populations where progeny needs to be removed. Moreover, the chambers were not configured with flexible pillars, which makes them unsuitable for strength measurements. Additionally, in these Earth-based studies, worms were cultured on plates and then transferred to liquid media. Transferring the liquid culture in a microfluidic device in an open manner is not safe as it can lead to contamination of the workstation at ISS and possibly cause health hazards due to the presence of bacterial food.",

The presence of 2 separate sections allows redundancy in case one section clogs and also reduces pressure drop during animal loading. Each section has a single inlet, a single outlet, and a side vent port to remove air bubbles. The pillar chamber has a diameter of 3 mm to allow the 1 mm long adults to move freely within the pillars arranged as a square lattice (Fig. 3b). The design of the pillar lattice was based on the body diameter of CeMM-grown adults and the optimal body confinement between pillars needed to induce maximum exertable force. The body diameter of the adult worms grown in CeMM is D ≈45 μm, which is about half the diameter of animals grown on NGM plates with E. coli OP50 diet. Therefore, pillars of diameter 40 μm were designed along with the pillar gap being ≈40 μm so that the body confinement of ≈1 is within the admissible range. The pillar chamber height was designed to be ≈100 μm and the pillar height to be ≈80 μm, providing a clearance of ≈20 μm between the pillar tip and the chamber floor. To facilitate easy selection of the imaging focal plane by the crew, a focusing pillar of 200 µm in diameter was introduced at the center of the chamber (Fig. 3c).",

            "text": "To obtain animals of a specific age from the mixed population in FEP bags, we focused on sorting gravid adults since it allows the crew to visually confirm these egg-bearing animals (Fig. 3b). An on-chip strategy for size-based sorting of gravid adults was implemented by adding two key geometric features to the pillar chambers – tapered necks and sieve channels, as shown in Fig. 3c–e. The principle underlying these geometric features is that an animal of a given size is arrested in the tapered neck, while animals below this size are washed out from the sieve channel. The neck was designed to be ≈2.2 mm long with the minimum width being ≈25 μm such that the 1 mm long adult remains trapped in the neck until the flow rate is increased to push the trapped animal inside the chamber. The sieve channels separated by ≈20 μm at the end of the chamber serve the dual purpose of retaining the adult in the chamber but allowing a path for the washout of larvae and eggs. The high-resolution images of the pillars and sieve channels are shown in Fig. 3d and Fig. 3e, respectively. Since the chambers are connected to the flow channel via the tapered neck and sieve channels, they provide a low resistance path for the worm suspension to flow. Gravid adults passing through the flow channel tend to follow the low resistance path and become trapped in the necks (Fig. 3f). Once most of the necks are occupied, the adults can be pushed into the chambers by setting the pump to higher flow rates (See Supplementary Movie 1), as discussed later in the paper.",

The feed to the distribution valve comes from the CeMM syringe mounted on the syringe pump (see Fig. 4a, e) via an inlet port present underneath the mounting board (see Fig. 4b, c). The length of tubing from the media syringe is predetermined to create a fluid loop that can hold a defined volume of worm suspension aspirated from the FEP culture bag. Two ports of the valve are connected to the two inlets of the imaging cassette. The remaining two ports are connected to the worm culture bag and the waste collection syringe, respectively. The direction of fluid flow can be manually controlled by turning the knob on the distribution valve. A script was programmed into the syringe pump, allowing the astronauts to click on the pump program and follow the instructions to load the animals into the NemaFlex-S device.",

Instead of shipping the NemaFlex-S devices dry for spaceflight experiment, and priming them on ISS, which might lead to bubble formation as the liquid permeates the pillared chambers, we chose to prime the devices with deionized (DI) water on Earth and address any potential bubble issues prior to flight by conducting long-term device storage experiments.

The PDMS devices can be turned into hydrophilic by oxidized plasma bonding and it is reported that the hydrophilic nature of the device can be maintained for a longer duration of time if the device is submerged in water. Placing the entire WLA board in water is practically impossible due to space/payload constraints. Therefore, we adopted an alternative approach to mitigate water loss and maintain the hydrophilic nature of devices by creating a humidified environment around the PDMS surfaces. We not only maintained the humid environment around the microfluidic chip, rather we keep the wet towel directly on top of the PDMS microfluidic device. Placing a wet towel directly on top of the PDMS layer is equivalent to submerging the device in water. A blue surgical towel was attached on top of the PDMS layer and soaked with 5 mL of DI water. Another piece of the towel was attached to the bottom side of the WLA platform and again soaked with 7.5 mL of DI water. Once these moist towels were attached, the entire WLA was kept inside a Bitran™ bag. The excess bag was folded over the WLA and then put into a secondary Bitran bag. Humidity sensors were placed inside the primary bag, and a 9-week storage experiment was conducted. We observed less than 1% loss in humidity during the test period indicating that our approach to preventing moisture loss and minimizing bubbles within NemaFlex-S devices was successful. This technique helps in maintaining the hydrophilicity of the microfluidic device and prevents the formation/nucleation of air bubbles in the NemaFlex-S devices.",

We saw a drastic decline in the animal density for time point 3 and 4 in worms cultured at ISS, whereas ground control cultures grew as expected. The reasons for the decline are unknown to us. Preliminary investigations suggest that it could be due to radiation, contamination, or maybe a combination of both, which is yet to be ascertained. We also froze worm cultures after NemaFlex experiments to conduct gene expression studies, enabling us in the future to correlate muscle strength changes to alterations in gene expression. No drying or glass cracks were observed in the NemaFlex-S device over long-time storage. Additionally, no leakage was observed while transferring the cultures from one bag to another and while loading them into the NemaFlex-S device. Thus, the microfluidics-integrated spaceflight hardware for muscle strength investigations in C. elegans has been successfully launched and operated onboard at the ISS. Hundreds of videos were collected along with frozen culture samples for gene expression analysis – this data is being currently analyzed and the results will be reported in the future.",

(ii) An additional constraint is the maintenance of defined bacterial population densities across the 8-week duration of our spaceflight experiment may present challenges since high bacterial density might limit oxygen availability for nematodes.

In the future, more studies need to be conducted to identify muscle mutants that grow well in CeMM across multiple generations.
