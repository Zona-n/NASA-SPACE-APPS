The cell membrane participates in numerous processes, including endo- and exocytosis and cell division, and is involved in the response to external stimuli. Variable but stabilized microdomains form in membranes that include specific lipids and proteins that became known as (detergent-resistant) membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts with various subclassifications. The composition, especially the sterol-dependent recruitment of specific proteins affects endo- and exo-membrane domains as well as plasmodesmata. The enhanced saturated fatty acid content in lipid rafts after clinorotation suggests increased rigidity and reduced membrane permeability as a primary response to abiotic and mechanical stress. These results can also be obtained with lipid-sensitive stains. The linkage of the CM to the cytoskeleton via rafts is part of the complex interactions between lipid microdomains, mechanosensitive ion channels, and the organization of the cytoskeleton. These intricately linked structures and functions provide multiple future research directions to elucidate the role of lipid rafts in physiological processes.",

Examining increasingly complex interactions between specific plant responses and environmental conditions elucidates the complex effects of gravity on plants and their response to weightlessness. The realization that plants must be a component of Bioregenerative Life Support Systems (BLSS) focused on plant productivity and the identification of the most suitable species for space cultivation. Plant functionality during long-term space missions includes the responses to elevated CO2, the hydrolysis of water, oxygen generation, possibly hydrogen as generic fuel, and the recycling of water. However, the provision of edible biomass is certainly the most sought-after benefit of plant growth in space. Human explorations of the Moon or Mars are impossible without BLSSs as the reduction in resources (water, food, and oxygen), achievable with BLSSs, is essential because of energy requirements for food transport, stowage, as well as the additional mass of packaging, which makes in situ food production and BLSSs essential for long-term space exploration. Additional criteria for in situ food production are logistical and space- and energy-saving measures. The degradation of food during long-term storage and the required volume can only be solved by means of preparing fresh food.",

It participates in numerous basic cell processes such as the transport of metabolites and ions, cell signaling, endocytosis, cell division and differentiation, and defense from pathogens. The ability of plants to remodel membrane lipids and protein composition plays a crucial role in the adaptation to stress and environmental changes, including altering temperature, drought, salinity, and heavy metals.",

The appearance of CM folds of a complicated configuration during space flight was suggested to associate with enhanced metabolism and endo- and exocytosis. Hanke used planar lipid bilayers with alamethicin-induced pores to demonstrate the dependence of conductivity relative to the gravity vector. The influence of gravity has been confirmed in genuine biological membranes of E. coli. The gravity dependence of the viscosity of artificial and cell membranes was demonstrated during parabolic flights by means of fluorescence polarization microscopy. Similarly, changes in the composition of phospholipids, fatty acids, and sterols in the CM of clinorotated pea seedlings have been reported and prompted the hypothesis of gravitational decompensation, which postulates that the surface tension of the membrane under microgravity conditions can induce changes that are enhanced by the heterogeneity of the membrane. Thus, alteration in the physicochemical properties of the membrane leads to changes in the permeability and ion transport activity of membrane-bound channels, followed by adjustments of metabolism and eventually physiological responses.",

            "text": "The presence of functional microdomains with specific localization and lipids and protein composition in the CM became known as “membrane microdomains” or “detergent-resistant membranes” (DRMs). However, the most common name is “lipid rafts” with the distinction of rafts, clustered rafts, DRMPs, and Caveolae. The formation of ordered domains was linked to the behavior of DRMs in liposomes and cells. Upon stimulation, rafts may cluster to form larger structures, i.e., temporally and spatially organize functionally different protein complexes, that improve the synchronization and specificity of cellular responses. The functional significance of lipid rafts, their dynamic assembly, and the enrichment of cholesterol, sphingolipids, and saturated fatty acids affect membrane trafficking and signaling. Thus, lipid rafts take part in many vitally important cell processes. The concept of cholesterol clustering helps explain its effect on membrane fluidity via the formation of ordered domains and changed membrane deformation by altered protein interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton, and the formation and stabilization of lipid–protein assemblies. The main function of sphingolipids is their involvement in signal transmission from the outer to the inner membrane surface. This function depends on various lipophilic (ceramide) or hydrophilic (carbohydrate) attachments, which determine the extent of the interaction of the lipid bilayer with the polar environment. Sphingolipids are localized on the outer membrane surface, and the specificity is determined by the attached carbohydrate moiety. Lipid rafts explain the biochemical processes of the cell membrane under normal and stress conditions that cannot be explained otherwise. The increased cholesterol and saturated fatty acid content of the raft fraction in clinorotated pea seedling root membranes indicated raft sensitivity to clinorotation.",

Microdomains have sizes in the range of 100–400 nm and often contain aggregated protein complexes. Six proteins of 22, 28, 35, 60, 67, and 94 kDa anchored to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) were detected. Based on one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and immunoblotting, DRMs were shown to be highly enriched in glucosylceramide and in a mixture of phytosterols—stigmasterol, sitosterol, 24-methylcholesterol, and cholesterol—compared with the CM from which they were isolated. Phospho- and glycoglycerolipids were detected in lipid rafts in small quantities. The role of plant rafts, defined as the sterol-dependent ordered assemblies of specific lipids and proteins in plant CM as a signaling entity is based on their ability to recruit specific membrane proteins that elicit specific signaling and responses to biotic and abiotic stress, cellular trafficking, and cell wall metabolism. The enrichment of microdomains with polyphosphoinositides and saturated fatty acids also suggests lipid raft involvement in cell signaling.",

Microdomains from A. thaliana cotyledons were enriched with specific signaling components, particularly with seven receptor kinases with leucine-rich repeats, 10 other kinases, the β subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, and five other GTP-binding proteins. Sterol-dependent proteins associated with rafts comprise part of the membrane-bound ABA signaling system in A. thaliana leaves, in particular, phosphatase ABI1 (a negative regulator of ABA signaling) and calcium-dependent protein kinase 21. The glycoprotein At-FLA 4 (fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 4) positively regulates the biosynthesis of cell wall components and normal root growth through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway.

A significant increase in the cholesterol content is a marker of the increased rigidity of lipid rafts that reduces membrane permeability. The regulatory role of sterols in membrane structure and fluidity and the assembly of specific proteins will affect cell responses to abiotic stress and microgravity. The concept of cholesterol clustering helps explain functions such as membrane fluidity via lipid ordering and membrane elasticity by protein interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton and the formation and stabilization of rafts themselves. Interestingly, the equality of the CM fatty acid saturation index (the ratio between unsaturated and saturated fatty acids) for static and clinorotated samples was most likely based on new specific fatty acids that maintained CM fluidity (microviscosity).",

Filipin fluorescence is the established tool for sterol visualization in biological membranes.

In 6-day-old seedlings, the CM was marked by filipin with a dashed thinner blue line (Figure 3C) and the intensity of the filipin fluorescence diminished, possibly because the cholesterol content decreased, as changes in the cholesterol labeling intensity depend on the developmental stage.",

The dependence of membrane function on their lipid composition and associated proteins can affect the activity of integral membrane proteins, including ion channels. According to current concepts regarding the heterogeneity of the lipid bilayer, rafts link the CM with the cytoskeleton and affect cell polarization and thus signal transmission from the membrane surface to intracellular structures, in particular, the reorganization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. Proteomic analysis revealed the inclusion of various actin-binding proteins as well as the actin and α- and β-chains of tubulin in rafts. The influence of cholesterol on the actin cytoskeleton depends on the initial state of the microfilament network. Cholesterol-dependent rearrangements of the cytoskeleton are determined by the balance of globular and fibrillar actin in the cell, which demonstrates a new role of membrane cholesterol in cellular mechanotransduction and organization. The suggestion that the cytoskeleton may be a gravity sensor has been supported by its modifications in microgravity and clinorotation, especially in non-specialized cells. For example, an increase in cortical actin microfilaments and the appearance of short and disoriented “scattered” microfilaments under clinorotation were described in the root and hypocotyl elongating cells of A. thaliana. Possibly, clinorotation is assumed to enhance the mutual dependence between the actin and tubulin elements of the cytoskeleton and part of the cellular stress response.",

Reduced tubulin gene transcription might have caused the suppression of MT reorientation. It is interesting to note that changes in the microtubule orientation and length occurred in the elongating cells of hypocotyls and the root distal elongation zone (DEZ), distinguishing specific physiological properties and functions. Cytoskeletal elements regulate both the growth polarity and the maintenance of cellular growth. Cell growth in the DEZ involves cytoplasm expansion (non-directional growth), which requires the dynamic formation of MT, which makes especially cortical MT more sensitive to changes related to microgravity. These microtubules function via associated proteins and regulatory kinases and phosphatases.",

Such changes were demonstrated in the protonemata of Funaria hygrometrica grown under long-term slow clinorotation and in wheat plants grown in space. Galacturonic acid reduced the methoxyl groups of pectins, which release calcium ions because of enhanced cellulose and pectin hydrolysis. Decreasing levels of cellulose and polysaccharides per unit of length have also been reported in the coleoptiles and roots of the Oryza sativa and A. thaliana hypocotyls in spaceflight compared with ground controls. The degradation of 1,3:1,4-β-glucans reduces these polysaccharides in growing rice shoots and affects the mechanical properties of cell walls in microgravity.

Most experiments showed that [calcium] in cells increased under microgravity and clinorotation. Calcium is a well-established second messenger and plays a crucial role in signal transduction in all eukaryotic cells. Its messenger functions involve transient changes in the cytosolic ion concentration in response to a variety of external and internal stimuli, including light, hormones, temperature, anoxia, salinity, and gravity. The role of calcium ions as secondary messengers depends on short-term alterations in cytosolic concentration, which are mediated by the actions of Ca2+-permeable ion channels, the efflux by Ca2+-ATPases, and Ca2+/H+ exchangers. Calcium ions enter the cytosol from the apoplast through selective channels in the CM and/or a release from intracellular sources, such as an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the vacuole, which are typically activated by inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate. An increase in the intracellular calcium activity in microgravity was assumed to occur due to the activation of mechanosensitive calcium channels, which was demonstrated by gadolinium, which blocks such channels, as well as a possible decrease in Ca2+-ATPase activity associated with lipid rafts. The complex interactions between the roles of cholesterol and lipid microdomains in regulating mechanosensitive ion channels and the organization of the cytoskeleton provide multiple future research directions.",

The quantitative differences in the content of lipids and fatty acids in the CM of epicotyls and roots are most likely associated with the structure, growth, and specific functions of specific cells. In contrast to the root proper, the root cap contains statocytes, which are specialized cells for the perception of gravitational and mechanical stimuli including clinorotation. Therefore, the CM state of these tissues exhibits a specific composition. The heterogeneity of lipid rafts is linked to the specificity of the transcriptome and proteome interactions.
