Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.",

In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci. Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors, however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined.",

The microbiome of the ISS has been extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic and culture-based investigations, yet only recently have these effort been combined. The results are divided among those that report similarities to Earth built environments including United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms, and those that detected significant differences from terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project, the Japan-based ISS analog module, and a French Guiana-based cleanroom. Despite the differences in methodologies and results, the detection of opportunistic human pathogens including E. faecalis, is a common phenomenon. With the exception of, the previous metagenomic efforts were limited to characterizing diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution to confidently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed for Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter bugandensis, only a single culture-based report has quantified pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporum isolates from the ISS) in a host model. As a result, the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact crew health remains unclear.",

The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite®. Three replicates were prepared for each isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet into 1 mL of sH2O. To ensure the samples were homogenously resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The cells were then serially diluted into sH2O and 10 μL track dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At the t = 0 time point, the number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated as the starting population size that survived the initial drying on the coverslip (N0). Subsequent samples were removed from the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined from the ratio of N/N0. Each time point was evaluated when N was ≥ 30 CFU.",

Phylogenetic proximity of the selected type strains to the ISS isolates validated the selection based on ST. Genome size and gene count (Figure 2B) show patterns of genomic expansion and loss within clades; for example, within the clade containing V583 a general pattern of larger genome size and higher gene count is evident, yet nearby ISS_1 has a more streamlined genome in comparison to its neighbors. Genes are classified into core, soft core, shell, and cloud on the basis of the number of isolates sharing each gene (Figure 2C; Supplementary Figure S1) and the Roary-estimated patterns of gene presence and absence highlight potential patterns of gene loss or gain (Supplementary Data File S1).",

Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes with known annotations, mazG, which encodes a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase involved in survival under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTG-motif protein cell wall anchor domain protein. Neither ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.: CP046111) contained individually unique genes. Consistent with this finding, analysis of the core alignment revealed that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 differed by only 14 bases. However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were classified as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-110) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second (pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis (Supplementary Figure S2), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species, with all non-Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and, with lower identity and query coverage, Listeria (Supplementary Figure S3).",

Optical density measurements revealed there were no significant differences in the growth kinetics between the ISS isolates and the reference strains. Strains were first evaluated in Mueller-Hinton broth for comparison to clinical laboratory standards for antibiotic resistance of E. faecalis ATCC® 29212, and in the commonly used growth media BHI to determine MICs relative to the commensal isolate OG1RF. In MH broth, all strains tested exceeded the resistance levels set forth by ≥ 2-fold for amoxicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamycin, and kanamycin. ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 were also categorized as resistant to tetracycline. When evaluated in BHI, all ISS strains exhibited MICs equivalent to OG1RF with the exceptions of oxacillin and tetracycline (Table 4). All ISS strains showed ≥ 4-fold more resistance to oxacillin. Isolates ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4, each carrying a tetW/N/W gene, displayed an MIC of 64 μg mL–1. These isolates were 4-fold more resistant to tetracycline than OG1RF (MIC of 16 μg mL–1), and displayed resistance levels equivalent to the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583.

For the comparative analyses, the commensal type strain OG1RF and the clinical isolates, MMH594 and V583, were chosen because of their extensive genotypic and phenotypic characterization, specifically in regards to C. elegans pathogenesis.

Another tool related to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identified twenty virulence factors among the ISS strains, but fifteen were present in the commensal isolate OG1RF as well (Table 3). We cautiously interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates, but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal strains of E. faecalis. Further validation for these predictive algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human health.

As a result, C. elegans infected with E. faecalis reach the LT50 33% faster than worms fed a normal diet of E. coli OP50. None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing (Figure 4).

In general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation tolerant than closely related microorganisms. demonstrated that the spaceflight environment onboard the ISS did not select for “extremo-tolerant” strains of B. cereus and S. aureus. Likewise, we found no significant differences in desiccation tolerance between the ISS E. faecalis isolates and their representative type strains (Figure 3). This indicates that their environmental survival in the ISS was attributable to the previously described intrinsically rugged nature of E. faecalis. compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains, and also failed to find genomic signatures for their increased environmental resistances (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized stress response. In agreement with we conclude that the interior space environment (e.g., microgravity, increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species of bacteria, such as E. faecalis, but as of yet, there is no evidence suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence.",

However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of clinical isolates (Table 4). In addition to harboring genes that make combating infections difficult, E. faecalis strains possess the ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus. Although there have been no reports of VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication, it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43.
