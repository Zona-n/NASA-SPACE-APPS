Although these physiological responses can involve the microbiome on Earth, host-microbiota interactions during spaceflight are still being elucidated. We explore murine gut microbiota and host gene expression in the colon and liver after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight using multiomics. Metagenomics revealed significant changes in 44 microbiome species, including relative reductions in bile acid and butyrate metabolising bacteria like Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional prediction indicate over-representation of fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance genes. Host gene expression described corresponding changes to bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These changes imply that interactions at the host-gut microbiome interface contribute to spaceflight pathology and that these interactions might critically influence human health and long-duration spaceflight feasibility.",

Research in tissue culture using the high aspect ratio vessel simulated microgravity model system developed at the NASA Johnson Space Centre characterised increases in pancreatic production of α-TNF, which increased insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilisation in adipocytes. In mice, a reduction of insulin sensitivity has been observed after microgravity simulation using hindlimb unloading. This is reflected in the muscle transcriptome after spaceflight, where insulin receptor signalling is suggestive of disrupted glucose homoeostasis.",

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the intestinal lipid metabolic sensors SBP-1 and MDT-15 respond to simulated microgravity, with RNAi knockdown of sbp-1 and mdt-15 reducing lipid toxicity. Spaceflight metabolic studies from the Bion space program (Kosmos 605, 690, 782, 936 and 1887 (1973-87)) characterised rats as hyperlipidemic, with spaceflight inducing elevated serum or hepatic fatty acids, and substantial increases in cholesterol (67%). Similar lipid dysregulation, suggestive of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NFALD), has been a consistently observed mammalian response to spaceflight alongside aligned disruption of insulin metabolism and glucose homoeostasis. These observations in mice and humans on the ISS include widespread changes in the hepatic proteins which drive lipid metabolism, significant increases in steatosis, cholesterol and low-density lipids and reduced high-density lipids.",

            "text": "The immune system can be compromised by spaceflight, both in space and after return to Earth. Despite quarantine before flight, infection with influenza and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been observed in astronauts. Up to 50% of astronauts also exhibit immunodeficiency upon returning to Earth, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This dysregulation manifests through decreased T cell and B cell abundance, and impaired natural killer cell and macrophage function. The underlying cause of these changes are thought to be driven by microgravity, isolation, and stress associated with spaceflight, as well as shifts in the gut microbiome. On Earth, comparable changes in muscle integrity, glucose homoeostasis, lipid metabolism, immune and psychophysiological function have been associated to gut microbiota. Similarly, unique built environment surface microbiology arises from long-duration confinement, reshaping the bidirectional exchanges between usually diverse environmental microbial ecosystems and the gut microbiome to promote opportunistic pathogenicity.",

More recently, Bedree et al. explored the gut microbiome of BALB/c mice flown in the RR-5 mission using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing and reference-based whole metagenome sequencing (WMS). Amplicon analysis identified 14 ASVs as different in relative abundance (p <0.1) between spaceflight (ISS) and ground controls after 9 weeks of spaceflight, including increases in the genera Clostridium, Romboutsia, Ruminiclostridium, and Shuttleworthia, and decreases in Hungatella, while WMS identified significant enrichment of Dorea sp. and the species Lactobacillus murinus.",

Two control groups included GC_LAR and GC_ISS, reared in identical habitats at the Kennedy Space Centre and sampled after 29 and 56 days of the mission, respectively. Although reduced muscle mass and bone density in astronauts and mice during spaceflight are commonly observed, in this study, total mouse body weight was trending to increase after 29 days of spaceflight in Live Animal Return mice (FLT_LAR; n = 9) and significantly increased after 56 days of spaceflight in ISS mice (FLT_ISS; n = 7, p <0.05). Carcass mass did not differ significantly (t-test, p > 0.05) between Ground Control Live Animal Return (GC_LAR; n = 7) and FLT_LAR mice, which weighed 28.9 g−1 (±1.6) and 30.1 g−1 (±1.4), respectively, but did significantly (t-test, p <0.05) increase from 28.4 g−1 (±1.4) in Ground Control ISS (GC_ISS; n = 9) mice to 32.9 g−1 (±1.0) in FLT_ISS mice (Supplementary Fig. 1). Suzuki et al. observed similar increases in the mouse habitat unit 3 mission and attributed these changes to substantial increases in both white and brown adipose tissue, and large increases in total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

Co-assembly across all 32 mice generated 219,259 contigs and back-mapping captured 85.1% of raw counts after filtering out reads using the mouse genome (154,692,460 counts). This included 22,318 contigs which could be provisionally annotated (>90% nucleotide identity) from 175 species and shared an average of 99.1% average nucleotide identity (ANI) with known species or strains (and capturing 84.5% of total counts) (Fig. 2G, H). After sparsity (>90% counts in a single sample) and minimum sample (<3) occurrence filtering to allow statistical detection of spaceflight associated differences across biological replicates, 45,890 contigs remained which captured 154,238,826 counts. These contigs were provisionally annotated as putative bacteria (50.6%), viruses (0.9%) and metazoa (3.0%), or were unknown (45.4%). Grouping WMS contigs by species annotation and filtering for high confidence (>97% ANI, and > 3000 nt total length) identified 97 putative species representing 81 bacterial species within Firmicutes, and 7 Proteobacteria, 4 Actinobacteria, 1 Bacteroidetes, and 1 Deferribacteres, as well as the helminths, Trichinella nativa and Trichinella pseudospiralis (Supplementary Data 3). These species groups ranged from 2–2734 contigs, with an average total alignment length of > 880,000 nt and an ANI of 98.8%. Prevalent taxa included P. goldstienii representing 73.1%, Enterocloster clostridioformis representing 1.47% and all other species representing below 1% of relative abundance across all mice, including non-bacterial species such as T. nativa, representing 0.03% of relative abundance and present in all mice. P. goldsteinii is a ubiquitous commensal gut microbiome inhabitant in mice, and the species includes strains that play a role in reducing intestinal inflammation and maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity.",

The same team used murine supplementation experiments to illustrate that D. welbionis could partially counteract insulin resistance, adipose tissue hypertrophy and inflammation as well as suggest a potential association with mitochondrial content and activity in adipose tissue after high fat diet induction of obesity. In mice, changes in microbially produced butyrate are also know to directly influence expression of hepatic circadian clock regulating genes, such as Per2 and Bmal1, in a bidirectional interaction which can disrupt host metabolism. Enrichment of D. welbionis in both groups of spaceflight mice (Fig. 3A, B, I, J) compared to their respective ground controls here is therefore noteworthy given the high lipid accumulation, liver and mitochondrial dysfunction phenotype repeatedly observed in rodent research missions and astronauts. Whether the relative increase of this species might be counteracting or contributing towards spaceflight pathology is unclear and merits further study. Conversely, other butyrate producers, such as Intestinimonas butyriciproducens, were depleted after 29 days of spaceflight.",

Conversion of the major human primary bile acids in humans, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), to the secondary BAs deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), is mediated by a limited number of closely related clostridia containing the bile acid inducible (bai) operon, such as Clostridium scindens which was significantly reduced in abundance after spaceflight (Fig. 3I, J).

The Bai operon enables E. muris and C. scindens to increase concentrations of 7α-dehydroxylated secondary BAs that alter the host bile acid pool and act as ligands to bile acid receptors to influence host inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism. For example, bile sensor farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) modulates enterohepatic recirculation and host cholesterol metabolism through bile acid regulation of cyp7A1. Similarly, secondary bile acids such as DCA and LCA are potent agonists of the bile acid receptor TGR5, which controls glucose homoeostasis in adipose tissue and muscle by altering intestinal cell release of the insulin secretion regulator glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Liver production of α-MCA and β-MCA (in mice) is mediated by cyp2c70 genes but 7α/β-dehydroxylation mediated by microbes such as E.muris can modify MCAs after epimerization into HDCA, and critically regulate lipid metabolism. Interestingly, E. clostridioformis, significantly higher in relative abundance after both 29 and 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 3), is reported as increasing in the presence of E. muris and harbours 7α/β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDH), which can also transform primary and secondary BAs into oxo-bile acids.

In the host intestine, bile acids are passively absorbed or actively taken up through the apical membrane by the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, ASBT (Slc10A2), bound to the cytosolic ileal bile acid binding protein, IBABP (Fabp6), and then transported across the basolateral membrane by organic solute transporters, Ostα and Ostβ (Slc51A and Slc51B), or glucuronidated by UGTs (such as Ugt1a1) and exported back to the lumen by multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, MRP2 (Abcc2 transporter). Increases in intestinal bile acid also activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) heterodimer which regulates production and secretion of fibroblast growth factor FGF15/19, the negative feedback hormone which travels through portal circulation to bind hepatic FGFR4 receptors which suppress liver bile acid biosynthesis via inhibition of Cyp7A1.",

Taken together, these changes suggest spaceflight led to an alteration in bile acid metabolism in the intestine which would lead to bile acid suppression of hepatic Cyp7A1 and accumulation of cholesterol or hypercholesterolaemia. Interestingly, intestinal Cyp7A1 expression was identified as significantly repressed after 29 days of spaceflight. Previous proteomic research in Biom-1M mice suggested a decrease in bile secretion during spaceflight while hepatic metabolite assessment of mice after spaceflight in the Space Shuttle Atlantis measured increased accumulation of cholate and taurodeoxycholate. As the major cholesterol degradation mechanism in humans and mice is conversion to bile acids, cholesterol accumulation, alongside bile acid dysregulation and suppression of Cyp71A, should increase direct intestinal cholesterol excretion. Supporting this extrapolation, both cholesterol excretion transporter genes, Abcg5 and Abcg8, were significantly upregulated in the intestine after 29 days of spaceflight.",

Furthermore, Wang et al. reported host immune responses to microbial flagellin and lipopolysaccharide in the intestine increased expression of Il-23, and Il-22, leading to a downregulation of Rev-Erb and subsequent upregulation of Nfil3, which in turn can regulate clock-associated nutrient absorption and immunity.

Significant increase in the secretory mucin gene Muc2 and significant decreases in the membrane bound Muc3 and mucosal pentraxin 1 (Mptx1), three of the mostly highly abundant transcripts in the murine intestine here, were observed after 56 days of spaceflight, suggesting alterations to mucin within the intestinal lumen in direct contact with microbiota.

            "text": "Within the liver, Sterol 14-demethylase (Cyp51) catalyses the transformation of lanosterol into cholesterol and Cyp7A1 is then the first (and rate-limiting) enzymatic step in transformation of cholesterol in primary bile acid biosynthesis, which itself is strictly inhibited by bile acid concentrations. The production of bile salts is then a stepwise transformation process dependent on gene expression of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (Hsd3b7) gene, cholic acid-specific Cyp8b1 gene and acyl-Coenzyme A oxidase 2 (Acox2) before conjugation by Baat, Acnat1 and Acnat2, and subsequent excretion in the bile duct by bile salt exporter pump (BSEP). Cyp51, Cyp8b1 and Acox2 genes were significantly upregulated and Cyp7a1 and Fxr (Nr1h4) were significantly downregulated in the liver of mice after 56 days on the ISS (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The cholesterol transporter genes Abcg5 and Abcg8 (intestinally upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight) were upregulated in the liver after 29 days, but no longer significantly upregulated after 56 days, and Abcg8 was significantly downregulated. This reduction is surprising given the uniform accumulation of cholesterol observed after extended spaceflight; in contrast, Bsep and the bile acid conjugating acyl-coenzyme A:amino acid N-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Acnat1 and Acnat2; Baatp1/2) genes were significantly upregulated. Taken together, these expression profiles suggest hepatic accumulation of cholesterol, characteristic of glucose and lipid metabolic dysruption, and describe a subsequent increase in the production bile acids in the liver, preferentially cholic acid, their subsequent conjugation and export as bile salts, with the seemingly contradictory reduction in Cyp7A1 consistent with feedback inhibition.",

            "text": "The other major mechanism for detoxification during cholesterol and bile acid accumulation in the liver is sulfonation of bile acids, the transfer of a sulfonate group to a hydroxyl (OH) by a subfamily of cytosolic sulfotransferases (Sult2a genes) which increases their solubility, decreases enterohepatic recirculation, and increase excretion. After 29 days of spaceflight, hepatic Sult2a1, Sult2a4 and Sult2a5 were downregulated, which shifted to downregulation of Sult2a7 and Sult2a8 after 56 days (Supplementary Data 5). In humans, bile acid sulfonation is catalysed by Sult2a1, which sulfonates the 3-OH of bile acids. In contrast, mice have 8 Sult2a genes, with Sult2a1-6 sharing close homology to Sult2a1 but Sult2a8 being recently characterised as having major function in sulfonating 7α-OH of bile acids, of particular relevance here due to spaceflight microbiome changes in 7α-dehydroxylating E. muris and C. scindens. Notably, during acute phase immune responses, alterations to fatty acid, cholesterol, and bile acid metabolism, Sult2a1 is known to be suppressed by cholesterol and bile acid regulating nuclear Fxr (Nr1h4) and Car (Nr1i3) nuclear receptors, the latter of which also regulates bile acid responsive transporter gene Mdr1 (ABCB1), all three of which were downregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6C) and provide further evidence of bile acid dysregulation and toxic stress consistent with extensive disruption of the gut-liver axis.",

Here, pathways related to energy homoeostasis consistently altered in gene expression due to spaceflight after 29 and 56 days included enrichment of fatty acid degradation, insulin signalling and insulin resistance (Fig. 6D, E; Supplementary Figs. 17–21 and Data 5). The highest relative abundance (CPM) of transcripts significantly increased in the liver of mice after 56 days of spaceflight included fatty acid synthase (Fasn), the liver fat accumulation-associated carbonic anhydrase 3 (Car3), and the rate limiting enzyme for fatty acid desaturation, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), recently identified as a key role at the crossroads of immune response and lipid metabolism through interplay with PPARγ, also significantly upregulated here (Fig. 6F). Glucose metabolism was also disrupted by spaceflight as the glucose transporter Glut2 (Slc2a2) gene, required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and glycogen synthase 2 (Gys2) gene, the rate limiting enzyme for glycogenesis, were downregulated in the liver (and intestine) after both 29 days and 56 days of spaceflight. The free fatty acid and glycolysis regulating PPARα was also downregulated, and liver glycogen phosphorylase (Pygl) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3β) were significantly upregulated after 56 days of spaceflight (Fig. 6G). Taken together, the indicated decrease in glycogen synthesis and increase in glycogenolysis is characteristic of insulin resistance leading to the elevated fasting plasma glucose to pre-diabetic levels previously observed in crew of the Mars500 analogue mission and during spaceflight. Interestingly, in light of spaceflight induced changes to gut microbiota, upregulation of Gsk3β is also known to be activated by microbial-associated molecular patterns and promotes acute liver failure through inhibition of the PPARα pathway.",

So-called non-tight junction claudins have only recently been experimentally explored and, in hepatic cells, CLDN1 is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). More broadly, significant upregulation of Tgf-α and genes involved in complex Tgf-β signalling (Tgfb2, Tgfb3, Tab2, Tgfbrap, Smad3), alongside other markers (Dapk2, Vegfa, Dvl3) are associated to HCC, as well as immune suppression through the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21cip1; Cdkn1a), also significantly upregulated after 29 and 56 days of spaceflight.

Integration of metagenomic and host transcriptomic data here provided a highly complementary picture of the multiomic response to spaceflight, and is a strength of an Open Science culture and public multiomic resources such as GeneLab. The addition of untargeted serum and faecal metabolomics would have further strengthened this research and future studies should aim to quantitatively profile the specific deconjugated, dehydroxylated, oxidated, and epimerised bile acids in the system.

These changes in relative abundance were largely consistent in two groups of mice after spaceflight when compared to different on-Earth control groups at different timepoints as well as when using distinct metagenomic methodologies. The microbiome changes coincided with substantial changes to gene expression at the host-gut microbiome interface which are critical to barrier function, microbe interactions and bile acid transport in the intestine. These interactions suggest disruption of the signals, metabolites, and immune factors exchanged across the gut-liver axis which are likely to drive glucose and lipid dysregulation. Collectively, these multiomic findings suggest host-gut microbiome interactions during spaceflight are likely to underly widespread changes to host physiology which could pose a risk to health.",
