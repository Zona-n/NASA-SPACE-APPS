Since that time, considerable theoretical and experimental effort has been devoted to understanding how living organisms sense, respond, and adapt to long-term spaceflight, particularly regarding their exposure to chronic microgravity. Extensive investigations conducted in space have resulted in a relative wealth of understanding of microgravity effects at the mechanistic level in eukaryotic organisms including humans, animals, plants, and protists. In contrast to the situation in eukaryotes, it has proven more difficult to elucidate at the mechanistic level how single-celled prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea) sense and respond to reduced gravity.",

The actual situation is almost certainly more complex, and likely differs considerably depending on the type of receptor, cell, tissue, or organism studied. On the simpler end of the spectrum are single transmembrane mechanosensitive ion channels that respond to membrane deformation. On a more complex level, the surfaces of many eukaryotic cells exhibit focal adhesion (FA) structures which physically link the extracellular matrix to the internal cytoskeleton through complexes of signaling proteins, among them mechanosensitive transmembrane proteins. Such structures establish both physical and functional connections between the cell and its external environment (reviewed in).",

In addition to the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton, the nucleus itself contains a skeleton (the nucleoskeleton) composed of actin and lamin filaments. Furthermore, the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton are physically connected through Linker of Nucleus and Cytoskeleton (LINC) protein complexes (Figure 1). Evidence is accumulating that LINC complexes allow for the rapid mechanotransduction of signals from the cytoplasmic membrane and cytoskeleton directly through the nuclear membrane to the nucleoskeleton, enabling rapid gene expression responses (reviewed in). It is thought that the LINC complex is intimately involved in modulation of genome expression in response to mechanical stimuli through chromatin remodeling and recruitment of DNA and RNA polymerases, ligases, acetylases, methylases, and cyclin-dependent kinases, resulting in changes in gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, post-translational, and epigenetic levels.

Numerous studies using various cell types have shown that eukaryotic cells exhibit a morphological sensitivity to microgravity, exposure to which can cause alterations in cell shape, size, volume, and adherence properties. These signals are converted into alterations in chromosomal architecture, which in turn regulate the transcriptional apparatus. In spaceflight research, this general “mechanotransduction” model successfully explains the pathways for sensing and response to microgravity by plant and mammalian whole organisms, as well as single eukaryotic cells. It is unclear whether such responses to microgravity are direct or indirect (resulting from, say, downstream effects of microgravity on chemical gradients or fluid shear). However, results from parabolic aircraft and sounding rocket flights demonstrated that the transcriptomes of human monocytes responded immediately—within seconds—after exposure to microgravity or hypergravity (1.8 × g) suggesting that, in this case at least, gravity or its absence is exerting a direct effect on gene expression.",

The origins of this situation can be traced back to an influential and often-cited theoretical study from 1965 asserting that microorganisms smaller than 10 micrometers should not be able to perceive gravitational forces.

            "text": "Due to a lack of fluid convection in microgravity, spaceflight has been considered to be a quiescent environment characterized by low hydrodynamic shear and lack of convective transfer of mass and heat. To emulate this low-shear environment on Earth, various rotating devices called clinostats have been developed and utilized as microgravity analog systems. Early experiments cultivating microbes in clinostats indicated that certain phenotypes such as microcin B17 production by Escherichia coli and virulence in Salmonella enterica were altered in the clinostat environment. These and similar observations led to the notion of mechanotransduction as a possible mechanism for a microgravity response in prokaryotes, proposed in a 2004 review. Numerous subsequent investigations have been conducted to characterize the response of various microorganisms to the low fluid shear environment using both spaceflight and clinorotation (; reviewed extensively in). These studies clearly established a role for hydrodynamic shear stress, or its absence, in influencing some aspects of gene expression and some phenotypes in some, but not all, bacteria tested. Subsequent work mapping transcriptomic responses of S. enterica and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to spaceflight and clinorotation identified the molecular chaperone and global regulator Hfq as being implicated in the low-shear response, although its mechanism of action is currently unknown. Several studies have mapped global transcriptomic responses of bacteria to the low-shear environment, comparing cells grown in spaceflight and clinostat conditions with corresponding ground controls, but to date, these studies have failed to yield insights into a detailed underlying molecular mechanism.",

Our understanding of the interior architecture of living microbial cells has lagged behind that of eukaryotes, due to their small size at the limits of optical resolution and the lack of techniques for mechanical manipulation of such small cells. Indeed, until relatively recently the interior of the prokaryotic cell was thought to be an unordered “bag of enzymes” with little or no intracellular compartmentalization.

More recently, microbes have also been shown to respond to mechanical forces such as fluid flow, pressure, and contact with surfaces or other cells. Similar to eukaryotic cells, bacteria possess mechanosensory proteins either displayed on the cell surface (e.g., adhesins) or extending into the extracellular environment (e.g., flagella, pili). Proteins residing in the cell envelope can sense and respond to deformations of the cell surface. The integral membrane proteins MscS and MscL sense membrane deformation resulting from osmotic stress and respond by opening or closing their pores to allow passage of osmotically active solutes (e.g., potassium, glutamate, or trehalose) in order to maintain osmotic balance and turgor pressure. Adhesins present on the cell surface are able to sense forces such as shear, compression, or tension and transduce these signals to the cell interior, activating the production of second messenger molecules such as cAMP and cyclic di-GMP which in turn activate or repress transcription of target genes. Protein filaments such as flagella and Type IV pili are anchored in the cell surface and extend into the extracellular environment. These structures have long been associated with motility (flagella) and adhesion (pili), but recently have also been implicated in the regulation of gene expression via mechanosensing and mechanotransduction mechanisms (reviewed in). For example, motility of Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis cells through liquid media is due to the rotation of helical flagella driven by rotary motors embedded in the cell membrane. Contact of cells with a surface increases the torque applied onto flagella, inhibiting their rotation. This rotational inhibition increases strain on the flagellar motor embedded in the membrane, which generates a signal sensed by the two-component system histidine kinase DegS. DegS in turn phosphorylates the DegU response regulator, and phosphorylated DegU up-regulates the transcription of an entire class of genes involved in biofilm production. Thus, an outside mechanical force can be sensed by a bacterial cell and transduced to the transcriptional apparatus to dramatically change its phenotype from a solitary free-swimming cell to a sessile member of a biofilm community.

The RecA protein is central both in DNA repair and homologous recombination; it binds and forms filaments with both single- and double-stranded DNA and has been shown to exert cytomotive properties in the movement of DNA during double-strand break repair. H-NS proteins are a class of transcriptional repressors that nucleate at specific regulatory sequences and form stiff collaborative filaments that sterically hinder RNA polymerase from binding to promoters in the vicinity. It is estimated H-NS regulates the transcription of up to 5% of the genes in E. coli. However, at present, the mechanism(s) of exactly how cytoskeletal filaments are involved in coordinating DNA synthesis and chromosomal division with membrane and cell wall synthesis and cytokinesis in prokaryotes is currently unknown and an active area of research.",

In the last two decades, using fluorescence microscopy to track chromosomal loci inside bacteria cells, researchers have found that bacterial chromosomes are organized into stereotypical patterns, with specific chromosomal regions localizing to defined cellular locations (reviewed in). Over the past few years, the application of genome-wide high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) assays to bacteria has provided a detailed picture of the three-dimensional folding characteristics of the entire chromosome.

In Caulobacter crescentus and B. subtilis, but not E. coli, the chromosome exhibits long-range interactions. The two replication arms are juxtaposed from the origin to the terminus region, mediated by the SMC condensin complex. For all three bacterial species, the genome along its entire length is organized into chromosome interaction domains (CIDs), ranging from ~30 to >400 kilobase pairs. Regions within each domain interact with each other more frequently than with regions in other domains. The domain boundaries are often enriched with highly transcribed genes, and inhibition of transcription essentially abolishes all domain boundaries, indicating that the 3D architecture of the nucleoid is intimately linked to transcription.",

To accomplish this feat, selected parts of the nucleoid are constantly and dynamically de- and re-condensed in response to environmental signals. Dynamic restructuring of the nucleoid depends critically on a host of enzymes that control DNA topology, collectively known as topoisomerases, which maintain DNA in an optimal state of negative supercoiling. Transcription of a gene is dependent upon the local DNA superhelical state, and in turn, the transcription process itself influences DNA supercoiling, by overwinding DNA ahead of the transcription complex and underwinding it behind (reviewed in). A growing body of evidence points to changes in DNA supercoiling as being a key mediator between environmental sensing by a microbe and its response through modulation of global transcription patterns. It has been shown experimentally that DNA supercoiling is sensitive to variations in the physical environment such as: pH, oxygen, temperature, osmotic pressure, oxidative stress, nutrition, and growth phase, among others (reviewed in). In turn, it has also been shown experimentally that alterations in DNA supercoiling can influence the global pattern of bacterial gene transcription, and ultimately the phenotypic response to environmental changes (reviewed in). Historically, most studies in this area have been performed using Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, S. enterica, Vibrio cholerae); however, these investigations have been recently extended to the Gram-positive opportunist Streptococcus pneumoniae. Recent evidence suggests active transcription drives the formation of boundaries between CIDs, likely through alterations in DNA topology, thus highlighting the three-way interactions between nucleoid architecture, supercoiling, and transcription.",

Base methylation can modulate the interaction of DNA-binding proteins with their cognate sites, and methylation of DNA controls genome defense, chromosome replication and segregation, nucleoid organization, cell cycle control, DNA repair, and regulation of transcription (reviewed in). In particular, a number of specific systems have been described in which gene transcription is directly regulated by DNA methylation/demethylation/hemimethylation (; reviewed in). Furthermore, both nucleoid organization and chromosome replication are controlled by DNA methylation.

            "text": "From the examination of the studies cited above, we have seen that eukaryotic cells possess mechanosensing and mechanotransduction systems that modulate their gene expression in response to microgravity. Further, we have seen from the results of recent studies utilizing model bacterial species that it is becoming increasingly clear that prokaryotes also possess complex intracellular compartmentalization, analogs of cytoskeletal proteins, and sophisticated signal transduction networks comparable to those of eukaryotic cells. These networks serve to sense external environmental cues through surface structures and to transmit this information to the transcription apparatus via traditional signaling pathways such as two-component systems. From the available information and by analogy, we hypothesize that the prokaryotic cytoskeletal apparatus functions in an analogous manner to its eukaryotic counterpart. We further propose that the microbial cytoskeleton plays a key role in transducing mechanical changes sensed at the cell surface to the nucleoid, altering its architecture and the global transcriptional apparatus. Testing of this hypothesis will necessitate conducting new types of experiments in the spaceflight environment, such as: visualization of cytoskeletal structures, mapping of nucleoid architecture, and measurements of DNA supercoiling and methylation patterns, to name a few. As many of these measurements can be very sensitive to differences in sample handling, it will be of high importance in this endeavor to match as precisely as possible media and growth conditions, spaceflight hardware, and pre- and post-flight sample handling, to eliminate all possible variables with the exception of gravity. Ideally, it would be preferable to perform all exposures in the microgravity environment (providing 1 × g by centrifugation) and to perform all inoculations, fixations, freezing, etc. at the same time and using the same protocols. Results from such experiments hold the promise for uncovering a new and fundamental mechanism for microbial adaptation to spaceflight microgravity, mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.",
