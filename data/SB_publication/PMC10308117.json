            "text": "A single strain from the family Paenibacillaceae was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in April 2018, as part of the Microbial Tracking mission series. This strain was identified as a gram-positive, rod-shaped, oxidase-positive, catalase-negative motile bacterium in the genus Cohnella, designated as F6_2S_P_1T. The 16S sequence of the F6_2S_P_1T strain places it in a clade with C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which were originally isolated from plant tissue or rhizosphere environments. The closest 16S and gyrB matches to strain F6_2S_P_1T are to C. rhizosphaerae with 98.84 and 93.99% sequence similarity, while a core single-copy gene phylogeny from all publicly available Cohnella genomes places it as more closely related to C. ginsengisoli. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) values to any described Cohnella species are <89 and <22%, respectively. The major fatty acids for strain F6_2S_P_1T are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%), and it is able to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds. Given the results of the ANI and dDDH analyses, this ISS strain is a novel species within the genus Cohnella for which we propose the name Cohnella hashimotonis, with the type strain F6_2S_P_1T (=NRRL B-65657T and DSMZ 115098T). Because no closely related Cohnella genomes were available, this study generated the whole-genome sequences (WGSs) of the type strains for C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli. Phylogenetic and pangenomic analysis reveals that F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli, along with two uncharacterized Cohnella strains, possess a shared set of 332 gene clusters which are not shared with any other WGS of Cohnella species, and form a distinct clade branching off from C. nanjingensis. Functional traits were predicted for the genomes of strain F6_2S_P_1T and other members of this clade.",

            "text": "The International Space Station (ISS) is an orbital space habitat which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts for 22 years (Robinson et al.,) and is therefore the only current model for how the microbiome of a space habitat evolves over time. Because the ISS is hermetically sealed against the vacuum of space, sources of its microbiome must necessarily be the human commensals from the astronauts, new equipment and supplies, or experiments conducted on board (Checinska Sielaff et al.,; Urbaniak et al.,). With a number of both governmental and commercial closed-habitat space facilities planned for both earth and lunar orbit in the near future, studying the microbiome of this unique habitat is vital to understanding both how astronaut health is affected by the presence of bacteria and fungi exposed to the space environment, and how those microbes can be utilized for biotechnological applications. Part of this effort should include the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and taxonomic classification of microbes isolated from the ISS, to track their sources, spread, interactions, and potential applications. Until the mid-2010s, monitoring of bacteria and fungi aboard the ISS was mainly done via traditional culturing and identification using Sanger sequencing methods, to ensure crew health and food and water safety (La Duc et al.,; Checinska et al.,). More recently, a series of NASA Space Biology-funded missions known as Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 investigated the metagenomes of ISS surfaces and performed WGS on all isolated bacteria and fungi (Checinska Sielaff et al.,; Venkateswaran et al.,; Urbaniak et al.,; Bijlani et al.,; Daudu et al.,; Solomon et al.,; Blachowicz et al.,; Simpson et al.,), in order to fully characterize the ISS microbiome and how it changes over time (Singh et al.,; Checinska Sielaff et al.,; Urbaniak et al.,). In the ongoing Microbial Tracking investigation of the ISS, spore-forming bacteria have been isolated multiple times from the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus; however, this is the first instance that a bacterium from the genus Cohnella has been isolated from an ISS surface. As part of the Microbial Tracking 2 mission series, during April of 2018, astronauts sampled various surfaces aboard the ISS (Urbaniak et al.,) with pre-packaged, pre-sterilized wipes, including the panel behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment (WHC). Upon return to Earth, the strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the WHC sample wipe, on blood agar incubated at 37°C. Preliminary 16S rRNA sequence analysis placed strain F6_2S_P_1T in the genus Cohnella.",

Species from this genus are used in industrial applications including fermentation, biofuel production, and wastewater treatment bioreactors (Lin et al.,; Hero et al.,; Chen et al.,; Mohammadi et al.,). As with the genus Paenibacillus, many members of the genus Cohnella are strongly associated with the plant rhizosphere environment, particularly that of legume species (Niang et al.,). Multiple novel Cohnella species have been discovered in the root nodules of leguminous plants, although only two species are known to fix nitrogen (Garcia-Fraile et al.,; Wang et al.,; Flores-Felix et al.,; Takada et al.,). Cohnella species are also thought to play an important role in recycling plant biomass within soil, with multiple members of the genus possessing genes for degradation of hemicellulose, cellulose, and xylan (Khianngam et al.,; Hameed et al.,; Hero et al.,; Johnson et al.,). Overall, while Cohnella species have been occasionally detected in the blood and oral cavities of immune-compromised or otherwise unhealthy individuals (Teng et al.,; Abou Abdallah et al.,; Kim et al.,), they do not appear to be common human commensals.",

F6_2S_P_1T as a novel species, for which chemotaxonomic, phenotypic, phylogenetic (using taxonomic marker genes), and comparative genomic analyses were carried out. In addition, initial taxonomic analysis for strain F6_2S_P_1T showed that it was most closely related to four Cohnella species without publicly available genomes, two of which are officially recognized species (Kim et al.,; Kampfer et al.,). Thus, the strains Cohnella ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and Cohnella rhizosphaerae DSM 28161T were acquired from the Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ) and whole-genome-sequenced, and assembled draft genomes were generated for these species.",

Sampling kits were transported to the ISS, where astronauts collected surface particulates from a square meter area of eight surfaces: (1) the cupola, (2) the WHC, (3) the advanced resistive exercise device, (4) dining table, (5) Zero-Gravity Stowage Rack overhead 4, (6) permanent multipurpose module Port 1, (7) laboratory overhead 3, and (8) crew quarters bump-out exterior wall (see Singh et al., for detailed surface descriptions). For each surface, the astronaut tasked with sampling donned a new pair of sterile gloves, removed and unfolded a sterile wipe from its bag, and wiped a square meter area of the surface three times, folding the wipe in half for the second pass and into quarters for the third pass; each time, the surface was sampled in a different direction (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) using the new previously unexposed surface of the wipe. Additionally, a wipe was removed from its bag and briefly exposed to the air, as an environmental control. A total of nine (eight locations and one control) samples were produced for each flight and stored at 4°C aboard the ISS and during transport to earth.",

The 16S rDNA sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 98.84 to 97.37%. “C. plantaginis” and “C. capsici” form their own well-supported branch within this clade, while C. rhizosphaerae is basal to strain F6_2S_P_1T and C. ginsengisoli is the most basal species of the clade (Figure 1). However, branch support for the divergence of strain F6_2S_P_1T from C. rhizosphaerae was low (50) and not shown in Figure 1. A gyrB-based phylogeny was also generated using all publicly available Cohnella genomes plus the outgroups T. dichotomicus and T. vulgaris (Figure 2). The gyrB sequence similarities of strain F6_2S_P_1T with the members of this clade ranged from 93.99 to 93.55%.

BGCs which might produce secondary metabolites were predicted in the genome of strain F6_2S_P_1T via the antiSMASH pipeline, including two lassopeptides, two non-ribosomal peptide synthetase clusters, one agrD-like cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide, one protein cluster, and one heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase. All are uncharacterized except the two lassopeptides; these are moderate matches to the lasso peptide paeninodin which was characterized from the species Paenibacillus dendritiformis (Zhu et al.,). Paeninodin and BGCs showing similarity to it have been predicted in multiple Bacillus and Paenibacillus endophyte species and are suspected to have biocontrol properties that combat plant pathogens (Muñoz et al.,; Semenzato et al.,). The genomes of C. ginsengisoli, C. rhizosphaerae, and strain F6_2S_P_1T all contained 2–3 predicted BGCs for paeninodin, with C. ginsengisoli containing one that is a 100% match, while C. nanjingensis (the most closely related species outside the C. ginsengisoli clade) contained a single paeninodin match. The only other match in any of these species to a known BGC is a predicted cluster in the C. rhizosphaerae which is a moderate match to ectoine. Other differences include multiple cyclic lactone autoinducer peptide BGCs predicted in the genome of C. nanjingensis (vs. a single one in all other tested genomes), and a siderophore predicted in the genome of C. rhizosphaerae. Strain F6_2S_P_1T was the only genome in the genus Cohnella which a heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like polyketide synthase was detected; these BGCs are used by cyanobacteria to compartmentalize N2 fixation and are activated in low-nitrogen conditions (Campbell et al.,), but as strain F6_2S_P_1T does not contain a full suite of genes for N2 fixation and the cluster is not a strong match, it is likely a producer of some kind of potentially uncharacterized lipid compound.

All members of this clade in addition to strain F6_2S_P_1T were originally isolated from plant tissue or the rhizosphere environment, including C. ginsengisoli (isolated from soil in which ginseng was grown, Kim et al.,), C. rhizosphaerae (isolated from healthy maize seed tissue, Kampfer et al.,), C. capsici (isolated from Capsicum rhizosphere, Wang et al.,), C. plantaginis (isolated from plantain rhizosphere, Wang et al.,), Cohnella sp.

It is speculated that strain F6_2S_P_1T might have originated from the plants grown in ISS. Since shotgun metagenomics of plants associated samples (tissue, water, and soil) were not available, the source of this novel strain isolated from the WHC location could not be confirmed. Cohnella was one of the top 30 genera recently detected via 16S amplicon sequencing of plant tissue of chili peppers grown in the Advanced Plant Habitat from sterilized seeds aboard the ISS, though it was not a top genus detected in artificial soil medium (Khodadad et al.,). Cohnella was also not a dominant member of the microbiome of Outredgeous lettuce grown aboard the ISS (Khodadad et al.,). However, since in these ISS studies, a 250-bp 16S rRNA gene amplicon was used for the microbial diversity analyses, Cohnella species might have not been identified appropriately.",

Most notably, C. ginsengisoli clade species were enriched in genes for heme oxygenase and for a bacteriophytochrome (annotated on NCBI as diguanylate cyclase), which were detected using both COG20 and KOfam database annotation. Consensus protein sequences for genes related to these functions, when aligned to the NCBI database, most closely match to the genome of Paenibacillus chitinolyticus (after matches to members of the C. ginsengisoli clade); heme oxygenase and diguanylate cyclase are located one after the other in the assembled chromosome of this species (NZ_CP026520.1). Heme oxygenase (HO-1) breaks down heme and releases iron and is a regulator of intracellular iron availability in plants and animals (Singh and Bhatla,). Enhanced HO-1 expression in plants and animals is also associated with stress response as the resulting biliverdin and bilirubin scavenge ROS species (Singh and Bhatla,); the bacterial species Paenibacillus polymyxa applied as a probiotic induces increased intestinal HO-1 expression as part of its anti-oxidant effects on gut health in animals (Wu et al.,). In bacteria, expression and production of heme oxygenase are associated with iron scavenging within a host, and heme oxygenase expression can have either beneficial anti-oxidant or enhanced pathogenic effects on plant or animal hosts (Richard et al.,). In non-photosynthetic bacteria, heme oxygenase also produces biliverdin which is used as the chromatophore in bacteriophytochromes (Takemoto et al.,). It is also possible that this HO-1/diguanylate cyclase complex acts as an oxygen sensor (Martínková et al.,). Other functions significantly enriched in this clade include stress response genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ. KEGG pathway analysis predicted two functional pathways in all C. ginsengisoli clade species which were not present in any other Cohnella species: a pathway for carbon fixation (incomplete reductive citrate cycle) and a pathway for plant terpenoid biosynthesis (specifically beta-carotene biosynthesis).",

Flavonoids are phenolic compounds produced by plants that often have medicinal or flavorful properties. α-L-rhamnosidase cleaves terminal α-rhamnose residues and in doing so helps concentrate and improve the action of flavonoids; α-L-rhamnosidase from different bacterial species is used for many industrial applications such as improving wine aroma, sweetening fruit juice, and increasing concentration and efficacy of antibiotic and anti-cancer compounds (Xie et al., ). The C. ginsengisoli clade and other Cohnella species enriched in α-L-rhamnosidase enzyme modules are all confirmed or likely plant symbionts or feed on plant tissue; however, since the majority of Cohnella and Paenibacillus species appear to have at least some association with plant tissue or rhizosphere, there may be additional promising applications for these particular species in processing plant medicinal or other plant phenolic compounds.",

But upon examination of regions to which the metagenomic reads mapped to strain F6_2S_P_1T, 98+% of reads mapped to regions of 16S or 23S rRNA genes and were only considered significant by bowtie2 because of the conserved nature of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. We therefore concluded that strain F6_2S_P_1T is not dominant in the ISS environmental surfaces or air particulates collected during the Microbial Tracking 1 and 2 mission series. However, molecular microbial diversity-based examination of plant and its associated materials using culturing and metagenomics would allow NASA to trace the source of this strain, since Cohnella species were reported to produce hormones that might promote growth of plants.

All species of Cohnella closely related to C. hashimotonis are from the plant/rhizosphere environment and likely have mutualistic associations with plant roots or other tissue. It is likely, therefore, that C. hashimotonis was introduced to the ISS not as a human commensal but as a plant commensal during one of the many plant growth experiments conducted on board. Nevertheless, C. hashimotonis can clearly survive in the extreme conditions of the ISS built environment, including radiation exposure, desiccation, low nutrient availability, and microgravity, and is closely related to a number of rhizosphere bacteria; it is therefore a promising candidate for testing as a member of plant-growth-promoting consortia for future plant experiments in outer space.",

Cells are endospore-forming, aerobic, and gram-positive rods, 0.5–0.6 μm in width and 0.8–100+ μm in length. In addition to normal cells, elongated, spaghetti-like cells (Figures 4D, 5B) are observed in light microscopy and SEM images. Colonies are translucent cream-colored, acquiring a pinkish tinge after multiple days of growth, and grow well on R2A but poorly on TSA. Growth occurs at between 15 and 37°C, between pHs 6 and 8, and from 0 to 3% NaCl. Colonies are weakly oxidase-positive and catalase-negative. This species reduces nitrate to nitrite, produces dextrin from starch, and utilizes the following carbon substrates: alanine, histidine, serine, sucrose, L-arabinose, melibiose, D-fructose, inositol, and lactose. The following substances are utilized for acid production: maltose, sucrose, D-fructose, D-ribose, N-acetyl, glucosamine, lactose, and trisodium citrate. Major fatty acids composing C. hashimotonis are anteiso-C15:0 (51.7%), iso-C16:0 (23.1%), and iso-C15:0 (10.5%). The polar lipids are diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, three aminophospholipids, and a phospholipid. The major quinone system is menaquinones MK-7. The cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain contained meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diamino acid.",

GC content is 58.37%. The type strain F6_2S_P_1T was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment, i.e., the space toilet, aboard the ISS, in 2018; its genome is available on NCBI, accession number JAGRPV000000000.
