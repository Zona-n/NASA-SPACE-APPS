            "text": "Impaired resorption of cartilage matrix deposited during endochondral ossification is a defining feature of juvenile osteopetrosis. Growing, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice exhibit a mild form of osteopetrosis. However, the extent to which the disease is (1) self-limiting and (2) reversible by leptin treatment is unknown. We addressed the first question by performing histomorphometric analysis of femurs in rapidly growing (2-month-old), slowly growing (4-month-old), and skeletally mature (6-month-old) wild type (WT) and ob/ob male mice. Absent by 6 months of age in WT mice, cartilage matrix persisted to varying extents in distal femur epiphysis, metaphysis and diaphysis in ob/ob mice, suggesting that the osteopetrotic phenotype is not entirely self-limiting. To address the second question, we employed hypothalamic recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy to restore leptin signaling in ob/ob mice. Two-month-old mice were randomized to one of three groups: (1) untreated control, (2) rAAV-Leptin, or (3) control vector rAAV-green fluorescent protein and vectors injected intracerebroventricularly. Seven months later, rAAV-Leptin-treated mice exhibited no cartilage in the metaphysis and greatly reduced cartilage in the epiphysis and diaphysis. At the cellular level, the reduction in cartilage was associated with increased bone turnover. These findings (1) support the concept that leptin is important for normal replacement of cartilage by bone, and (2) demonstrate that osteopetrosis in ob/ob mice is bone compartment specific and reversible by leptin at skeletal sites capable of undergoing robust bone turnover.",

            "text": "The appetite regulatory hormone leptin is produced by adipose tissue, circulates in levels proportional to total adiposity, and may act to couple skeletal metabolism to energy availability. Long bones in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are shorter, biomechanically weaker, and exhibit lower overall bone mass and greater marrow adiposity compared to wild type (WT) mice. However, differences in cancellous bone volume fraction between ob/ob and WT mice vary depending upon skeletal site and age. Leptin treatment in leptin-deficient mice normalizes bone volume and microarchitecture by increasing bone formation and resorption, and increasing longitudinal bone growth. Leptin treatment also normalizes bone marrow adiposity by reducing marrow adipocyte number and size. Taken together, these findings indicate that leptin affects bone marrow adiposity and skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover balance.",

However, long bones of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice retain cartilage within cortical and cancellous bone compartments into adulthood resulting in a mild osteopetrotic skeletal phenotype. Osteopetrosis is broadly characterized into two major subtypes, osteoclast-poor and osteoclast-rich. Mutations and/or factors that inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis. In contrast, mutations or factors that reduce osteoclast activity but do not inhibit osteoclast formation are responsible for the osteoclast-rich form of the disease. Both forms of osteopetrosis result in reduced bone resorption. Severe osteopetrosis is fatal while mild forms, such as that noted in ob/ob mice, result in decreased bone quality. Furthermore, some forms of osteopetrosis are self-limiting; abnormally high quantities of cartilage are initially present in bone during rapid growth but the cartilage is eventually replaced as skeletal growth slows with age. At present, it is unclear whether the mild osteopetrosis observed in growing ob/ob mice is self-limiting.",

Additionally, drugs that inhibit bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates, have been shown to induce osteoclast-rich osteopetrosis in children. The mechanism for leptin regulation of osteoclast activity has yet to be established but likely involves coordinated actions of the hormone on multiple genes that in concert regulate osteoclast activity. In support, gene profiling has established that leptin deficiency results in altered expression of several genes related to osteoclast differentiation and function.",

Frontal sections, 4 μm thick, were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to gel-coated slides. One slide was stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counter stained with toluidine blue (pH 2.5) to identify osteoclasts and cartilage matrix, respectively. Cartilage matrix was identified by metachromatic staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. A second slide was stained using the Von Kossa method and counter stained with tetrachrome to identify osteoblasts and verify that linear growth had ceased in the femur in 6-month-old mice: the presence of bone bridging across the growth plate was used as an index of termination of longitudinal bone growth. Cartilage was measured in cancellous bone in the distal femur epiphysis and metaphysis and in cortical bone in the femoral diaphysis.

Minimal or no cartilage matrix was found in the diaphysis of WT mice. In contrast, cartilage matrix was present in the diaphysis in ob/ob mice, but unlike at cancellous sites, did not decrease with age.

We hypothesized that the resulting reduction in turnover of primary spongiosa was the primary cause for prolonged retention of cartilage within the skeleton in ob/ob mice. This hypothesis is supported by the current study. The slower matrix turnover in the epiphysis compared to metaphysis was positively associated with longer retention of cartilage matrix. In addition, a reduction in cartilage in the epiphysis following hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was associated with increased bone turnover.

Osteoclasts are essential for (1) generation of primary spongiosa by directing vascular invasion into the growth plate and (2) replacement of mineralized cartilage matrix by bone to form secondary spongiosa. Cartilage matrix is prevalent in distal femur in 2-month-old WT mice because the rate of cartilage matrix deposition during longitudinal growth exceeds the capacity of matrix turnover to replace cartilage with bone. However, longitudinal bone growth slows with age and in male B6 mice ceases between 4 and 6 months of age. Cessation of linear bone growth in small rodents is due to the formation of bony bridges across growth plate cartilage precluding further elongation. In the current study, bony bridges were observed in the distal femur growth plate at 6 months of age in WT as well as ob/ob mice. The age range for longitudinal growth cessation corresponds to the disappearance of cartilage matrix from cancellous compartments.",

Furthermore, prior studies demonstrated that thinning of the proliferative zone of the growth plate is associated with reduced longitudinal bone growth rate. Chondrocytes express the leptin receptor and leptin was shown to exert positive actions affecting growth plate organization and growth plate expansion. Hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to programed removal of cartilage matrix by secretion of factors such as TNFSF11 (RANKL), MMP9 (matrix metallopeptidase 9), MMP13 (collagenase 3), and HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein 1) that mediate vascular invasion and are altered by leptin status.
