Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.",

            "text": "We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.",

            "text": "The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts. Sex differences play a role in diseases and metabolism both on Earth and in space. Some of these differences may be attributed to sex hormones. Estrogens play a variety of roles and serve many functions in women’s lives. Besides being a reproductive hormone, estrogen is involved in metabolism as well as in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems. Estrogen signaling activates membrane and nuclear receptors in both canonical and non-canonical ways to modulate metabolism, and promote growth, proliferation, and differentiation of diverse cell types. Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR2 but whose ligands are unknown. ESRRA also has DNA sequence homology to the estrogen receptor and can be activated by phytoestrogens (i.e. genistein). These receptors play pivotal roles in metabolism, insulin resistance, NAFLD, and mitochondrial function. Besides that, an unbalanced ratio of these receptors may have an impact on metabolism. Additionally, estrogen and insulin combine in controlling metabolic pathways. In animal models, knockout of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) (ESR1) in both male and female mice results in insulin resistance and dysglycemia. Estrogen receptors promote pancreatic cell survival, enhance insulin production, and improve insulin sensitivity. Female and male ESR1−/− mice both display reduced GLUT4 expression, further emphasizing the role of estrogen in glycemic control. Clinically, compared to premenopausal women, postmenopausal women have an increased risk of adverse metabolic profiles such as type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, impaired glucose and lipid profiles, increased android fat deposition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis. Estrogens also positively correlate with bone and muscle mass and are protective against disuse atrophy. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that insulin and estrogen signaling are key pathways regulating health in space.",

Our preliminary findings reported possible insulin and estrogen signaling alteration during spaceflight. A few published studies show insulin resistance parameters may change during spaceflight but data are conflicting, suggesting either decreased insulin or no change. Similarly, data on estrogen signaling are conflicting with one study revealing downregulation of ESR1 and ESR2 in the uterus whereas a recent study found no alterations in estrogen receptor expression in rodent ovaries. To address these gaps in our knowledge of insulin and estrogen signaling in response to spaceflight we examined these signaling pathways across multiple tissues in rodents from the same mission as well as in a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants/astronauts. Our results indicate significant changes in these pathways in response to spaceflight in both mice and people. These observations lay the foundation for further studies aimed at understanding the metabolic alterations induced by spaceflight as well as highlighting insulin and estrogen signaling as potential targets for countermeasures in future spaceflight missions.",

For this purpose, adrenal glands (OSD-98), kidney (OSD-102), liver (OSD-168), eyes (OSD-100), and skeletal muscles (i.e. quadriceps (OSD-103), gastrocnemius (OSD-101), soleus (OSD-104), tibialis anterior (OSD-105), and extensor digitorum longus (OSD-99)) were utilized (Fig. 1a). The transcriptomic data (RNA-seq) was obtained for 16-week-old female mice from the NASA GeneLab platform and were analyzed for insulin signaling, estrogen signaling and insulin resistance related genes and pathways. The gene lists for these hormones were obtained from the NCBI resource (i.e. ‘insulin signaling’ mus musculus). The greatest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were observed in the mouse liver (n = 3670), followed by soleus (n = 3518) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (n = 1859) muscles. In all, 2677 DEGs were unique to the liver, 2048 DEGs were unique to soleus muscle, and 784 DEGs were unique to EDL (Fig. 1b). The least number of DEGs was noted in the adrenal gland (n = 61) and 28 of them were unique to it (Fig. 1b). There are a total of 1970 unique genes from the NCBI curated gene list which are commonly encountered across insulin resistance, insulin signaling and estrogen signaling pathways. Most of the genes from the NCBI list related to insulin resistance, insulin signaling, and estrogen signaling were downregulated in the liver (Fig. 1c). In total, 645 out of the 1970 unique genes from the NCBI resource had gene expression values across all nine tissues. These genes were divided into seven biologically relevant clusters associated with insulin resistance and signaling (Fig. 1d). In particular, the last cluster (cluster 7) at the bottom of the heatmap were related to Gene Ontology (GO) processes such as lipid localization and glycerolipid metabolic processes which are related to obesity which in turn can lead to a decrease in insulin sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 1).",

The disease enrichment analysis revealed that 62 out of 145 genes were associated with diseases, with the top enriched disease being diabetes mellitus, followed by fatty liver (Fig. 2b). Human genes at the intersection of these pathways were used in a similar manner, and the top enriched disease was obesity, followed by hypertension (Fig. 2c). Thus, enriched diseases in both species emphasize the importance of insulin and estrogen signaling in metabolic diseases.",

During spaceflight, the liver RNA-seq data exhibits the most pronounced and unique impact on metabolic pathways as well as insulin and estrogen signaling. A comprehensive analysis of liver samples harvested after 37 days of spaceflight, revealed that both insulin and estrogen receptor signaling are predicted to be inhibited in the liver during spaceflight, as compared to ground controls (z-scores: −3.772 and −5.859, respectively). Our findings indicate that several genes of the insulin signaling pathway denoted development of insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis (z-scores: 2.481 and 3.737, respectively). Furthermore, insulin receptor was downregulated in the liver during spaceflight, along with inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which may indicate derangement of mitochondrial activity. In addition, disruption of estrogen signaling has been extensively reported to aggravate hepatic insulin resistance. According to this evidence, our analysis showed inhibition of estrogen receptor signaling in the liver during spaceflight (z-score: −5.859). Remarkably, genes associated with mitochondrial complex I, complex II, and ATP synthase were downregulated in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a). This is particularly relevant considering that estrogen receptors play a key role in mitochondrial activity and biogenesis. In livers harvested from mice after spaceflight, we observed impairment of estrogen signaling, which in turn may hamper oxidative phosphorylation by mainly affecting complex I (Fig. 4a).",

The leptin receptor (LEPR) and its signaling are crucial for metabolism and obesity. LEPR was downregulated upon return from spaceflight, regardless of the time interval (Figs. 7b, 8b, and 9b). The CYP17A1 gene was upregulated upon return (Fig. 7a). CYP17A1, encodes steroidogenic enzymes, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and 17,20 lyase. These enzymes are responsible for the production of cortisol, estrogen and androgens, and their deficiencies have been linked to both hormonal imbalance and metabolic dysfunction such as hypertension. Most hormones bind to proteins in the circulation. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) binds sex steroid hormones (estrogen and testosterone), and because of this interaction, the amount of SHBG is important as decreasing SHBG levels may lead to increasing free testosterone and estradiol levels, and vice versa. SHGB was upregulated 1 month upon return (R + 30d) and downregulated at the 3rd month (Figs. 7a, 8a, and 9a). Overlapping pathways were also observed such as PI3K-Akt signaling, cAMP signaling, insulin resistance, and estrogen signaling.

Among these overlapping genes, the percentage of the upregulated genes were higher than downregulated genes (Fig. 10a). Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios varied across cell types, based on insulin and estrogen linked gene categories. Log2 Female DEGs to Male DEGs ratios were positive in most cell types for insulin signaling (i.e. PBMCs, CD4 T, CD8 T, NK, DC, and ‘other’ subpopulations) (Fig. 10b). Certain cell types showed either a positive or negative ratio, depending on the hormone of interest. For instance, in females, in terms of DC, the DEGs ratio was positive for insulin-linked genes, but negative for estrogen-linked genes. In estrogen signaling, downregulated genes of B and other cell types were higher in females (Fig. 10b). In CD4 T cells, the ratios were positive in insulin, estrogen signaling and IR linked genes (Fig. 10b). We also calculated insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, and insulin signaling scores to track the changes over spaceflight. Higher enrichment scores were observed in all signaling pathways on R + 82, in comparison to R + 1 (Fig. 10c). In general, there was not a strong sex difference across cells (Fig. 10c). In certain cell types, differences in enrichment scores were observed depending on mission timeline and sex (Fig. 10c). In dendritic cells (DC), three pathways were positively enriched on R + 82 in both sexes; however, enrichment scores were different among females and males on R + 45 (Fig. 10c). T cell metabolism is modulated through insulin receptor signaling during inflammation and infection. Alternatively, energy consumption due to T cell activation drives upregulation of insulin receptors. Therefore, it is evident that insulin signaling is a key immune-metabolic event during increased physiologic demands, as in i4 cohort findings. Similarly, estrogen receptor alpha is known to mediate T cell-dependent inflammatory reactions in a diseased state.",

These tissues also displayed large changes in insulin and estrogen signaling gene expression (Fig. 1c, d). In the liver, insulin receptor (INSR) and downstream kinases AKT1 and AKT2 were downregulated during spaceflight. These changes were accompanied by decreased expression of other insulin receptor signaling genes. The metabolic pathways directly controlled by insulin were inhibited, which resulted in activation of dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. This last prediction is particularly striking given the increase in liver mass in these mice in a prior study utilizing the same cohort. Hepatic steatosis is a direct consequence of insulin resistance and can in turn exacerbate insulin resistance, leading to the development of a metabolic syndrome, and thus resulting in a vicious cycle. Prior studies have reported that during spaceflight, mice developed hepatomegaly and hepatic lipid accumulation. Further, the livers used in our analysis showed histologic evidence of lipid accumulation via Oil Red O staining in a prior study. Thus, our results suggest that disrupted insulin signaling may underlie these changes. In addition to the insulin signaling changes, the impaired estrogen signaling we observed (z-score < −2), may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance.",

PGC-1α, encoded by PPARGA1A, is a master regulator in metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. PPARGC1A downregulation in the liver was observed in both insulin and estrogen gene expression changes. Additionally, estrogen regulates mitochondrial function and biogenesis. In our liver data, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, complex 2, and ATP synthase genes were observed in the estrogen signaling network (Fig. 4a).

            "text": "Soleus muscle was the second most affected tissue in mouse studies. Soleus is a slow twitch (type I) muscle fiber, dense in mitochondria to provide sustained oxidative capacity for long-term demands. Prior studies show atrophy in the soleus muscle after spaceflight in both rodents and humans, and differential gene expressions between soleus and EDL muscle in rodents. Myostatin (MSTN) controls muscle mass and has been reported to be upregulated in microgravity in the soleus muscle but not in EDL; we confirm this observation. Other muscle atrophy related genes, FBX032 (Atrogin-1) and TRIM63, and mechanoreceptor PIEZO1 were also downregulated in the soleus. The downregulation of FBX032 and TRIM63 suggest the decline in soleus muscle size is not caused by increases in muscle protein degradation. This is consistent with past reports that muscle protein degradation is not increased in flight, but rather that protein synthesis declines. Previous studies in astronauts have suggested that altered insulin signaling may underlie muscle atrophy. Further, in a prior study from the same mission, mice soleus muscle weight was decreased by 19%, despite no change in body weight and being physically active in space. Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of IRS2 (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown C. elegans. On the contrary, insulin receptor signaling was activated in the EDL (z-score: 2.52). Moreover, insulin-induced ACACA, a rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis, was upregulated indicating an insulin responsive state in the EDL. Further, the majority of the insulin signaling significant genes at the intersection of soleus and EDL were regulated in opposite directions, which shows distinctive insulin response in these muscles (Supplementary Data 1).",

Estrogen-related receptor beta and gamma (ESRRB, ESRRG) induce mitochondrial function in myotubes and have a role in shifting muscle fibers towards oxidative types. Muscle-specific ESR1 knockout mice models showed decreased oxidative metabolism, impaired mitochondrial fission and glucose metabolism. Thus, our findings that ESR1 receptor was upregulated and ESRRB and ESRRG were downregulated in soleus, while ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG were all upregulated in the EDL, suggest diverse actions of estrogen in muscle metabolism during spaceflight. Interestingly, while soleus size declined and EDL remained stable, as consistent with past studies, the gene expression changes in soleus and EDL were distinct with EDL displaying an enrichment for growth pathways (Fig. 3), also consistent with prior studies. Estrogen receptor signaling pathways were activated in both EDL and soleus muscles. Soleus muscle mass recovery is reported to be slower after hindlimb suspension in ovariectomized mice. Additionally, increased estrogen receptor expressions were reported following muscle trauma in regenerating myofibers. Thus, estrogen receptor signaling activation and upregulation of ESR1 could be a compensatory mechanism against muscle disuse in the soleus muscle, whereas, in EDL the ESR signaling activation could support muscle growth and energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is another endocrine organ which is a part of cross-talk between muscle and liver. Our results are limited to muscle and liver, as adipose tissue was not available for analysis.",

However, as insulin and estrogen are circulating hormones, changes in their effects should be detected in these tissues; albeit at lower levels such as in the non-liver and non-soleus tissues in rodents (Fig. 1). As with the worm and rodent data, changes in insulin resistance related genes were detected inflight and postflight. Postflight samples from human subjects displayed upregulated insulin signaling genes (i.e., AKT1, RARRES2) as well as enriched insulin secretion and PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig. 8a), possibly suggesting decline in these pathways inflight. Additionally, postflight upregulation of the glucagon signaling pathway may indicate underlying postflight stress and may result in insulin resistance. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Also, in the human data, we found the estrogen signaling pathway was enriched with insulin related genes. ESR1 was upregulated within 2 months (R + 3d, R + 30d, R + 60d) and then downregulated in the 3rd month (R + 120d). In correlation with this finding CYP17A1 was upregulated postflight. These findings may explain the enriched ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis pathways seen postflight. Estrogen is closely related to the immune system, as an example, Treg cell distribution changes during menstrual cycles and increases during the follicular phase.",

In human skin, in the vascular region (VA) of the dermis, insulin resistance-related genes were more enriched in females during postflight while insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes were less enriched (Fig. 10d). In rodent skin samples, certain genes associated with tissue remodeling and collagen synthesis (i.e. COL1A1, COL6A3, COL6A1, COL5A1) (Fig. 6b) were downregulated in male mice (Fig. 6b). Interestingly, increased urinary COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels have been reported in the NASA twin study. Insulin and estrogen both play an active role in skin homeostasis, and insulin resistance has been linked to certain skin conditions. Dermis is a connective tissue rich in vasculature, fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibers, glands, hair follicles, and nerve endings. Both insulin and estrogen signaling exist in vascular endothelium and cause vasodilation via nitric oxide. Insulin-resistant states could impair vascular endothelium. Estrogen promotes skin and mucosal epithelialization and proliferation. Studies reported positive impact of estrogen in wound healing. Clinically, topical estrogen is used in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy, and it proliferates epithelium. Although our findings are limited by sample size, differences in the enrichment scores based on sex and skin compartments warrant future research on skin conditions after spaceflight in a sex and hormone-dependent manner. Further, due to our study setting, we cannot conclude on certain space-related environmental factors, such as lunar soil and dust, and their effects on insulin and estrogen signaling in the skin.",

The keyword “estrogen” was used to identify the estrogen-specific pathways through all database collections and all contributors within the Mus musculus species. Similarly, the keyword “insulin” was used to identify insulin-specific pathways through all contributors and Mus musculus database collections. The outcome of the fGSEA analysis is the normalized enrichment score (NES) of any given pathway, alongside valuable information on the analysis, such as the adjusted p-value, and the leading-edge genes of the pathway. The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the representation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the t-score of the genes. A positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while a negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list.
