Genomic analyses using EF-1α sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. However, its effects on the health of immunocompromised humans warrant further study.",

EF-1α allows for phylogenetic species recognition because it is applicable across Fusarium and it is informative at or near the species level and orthologous across the genus. Based on EF-1α phylotyping, F. oxysporum can be divided into 3 distinct clades with various clonal lineages within each clade. The phylogenetic tree inferred in Fig. 1A clusters ISS-F3/F4 into clade 3, belonging to a clonal lineage closely related to 4 other strains: three members of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici and the non-plant-pathogenic biocontrol strain Fo47 (members of a clonal lineage have the same sequence of conserved genes). Three other isolates of interest are highlighted in Fig. 1A because they too had been isolated from harsh environments, two cultured from ISS-grown Zinnia hybrida plants that caused foliar, stem, and root rot (VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2), and IMV00293, cultured at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster 12 years after the explosion.

Utilizing 104 effector candidates, van Dam et al. were able to show that strains infecting the same host generally possess a similar set of effectors and that these effectors are often identical within a forma specialis. This indicates that the accessory genome, specifically the effector genes residing in these regions, can be used to identify formae speciales within the F. oxysporum species complex (FOSC), including newly encountered strains. Figure 1B shows the hierarchical clustering of presence/absence patterns of 104 effector sequences in ISS-F3/F4 along with 62 other strains. The effector profile of ISS-F3/F4 was the most similar to Fo47 (a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate that has been shown to exert a biocontrol function) with similarities to another non-plant-pathogenic isolate, MN25, and CL57 (NRRL 26381), an isolate causing root rot in tomato, also known as NRRL 26381. The ISS-F3/F4 strains do not contain as many effector genes as (almost) all of the plant pathogens examined and do not possess any of the SIX genes (see top panel of Fig. 1B), which encode secreted fungal proteins that were first discovered in the xylem sap of infected tomato plants and have a well-studied role in plant pathogenesis.",

While ISS-F3, ISS-F4, and Fo47 had clusters involved in type III polyketide production, FOSC-3a did not appear to have that machinery in its genome. A summary of the biosynthetic gene clusters detected in the ISS-F3, ISS-F4, Fo47, and FOSC-3a genomes is shown in Fig. S3.",

The culturing conditions for fungal growth such as growing without antibiotic or with antibiotic used to prepare conidia did not affect ISS-F4 killing ability (P = 0.6888). The majority of worms died due to F. oxysporum hyphae piercing through the worm body (Fig. 6B); however, ISS-F4 virulence was attributed to both hypha- and non-hypha-related killing (Fig. 6C), whereas ISS-F3 virulence was attributed solely to hypha-related mortality (Fig. 6D). The hypha-related killing of ISS-F4 was still significantly greater than other strains (P = 0.0129) (Fig. 6B). Importantly, while ISS-F3, 293gr, and 293sp had less killing capability than ISS-F4, they should be still considered virulent, as their related mortality for worms reached 50% at 50 h. To note, there were no differences in mortality between 293gr and 293sp, indicating that growth on the ISS (12 days) did not change the virulence of this strain.

Performing disease assays to determine host specificity is both laborious and time-consuming; however, a recent molecular screening method based on 104 effector proteins was developed by van Dam et al. which can predict host specificity in F. oxysporum. The presence/absence of these effector proteins in ISS-F3/F4 was determined and compared to 62 other strains from a variety of formae speciales. The ISS strains contained relatively few candidate effector genes compared to phytopathogens, with numbers similar to that detected in two non-plant-pathogenic strains, Fo47 and MN14. The ISS isolates also did not contain any of the 14 secreted in xylem (SIX) effector genes, which encode cysteine-rich secreted proteins that appear to manipulate host defenses to promote infection.

            "text": "The ISS is a hermetically sealed system, closed off from its surrounding environment, with microbial introduction being of terrestrial origin from astronauts and payloads. ISS-F3/F4 were most likely introduced in the same fashion, so it begs the question why they had been identified only on the ISS and not on Earth, where 150 formae speciales have already been characterized. One hypothesis is that ISS-F3/F4 are present in relatively low abundances on Earth but were selected because of their ability to withstand ISS-associated environmental pressures such as increased radiation, which compared to terrestrial indoor buildings, is 100 times greater. In a recent study by Byrne et al., it was found that Escherichia coli developed extreme resistance to ionizing radiation, comparable to that observed with Deinococcus radiodurans, with mutations in only 9 genes, all of which happen to be involved in radiation resistance. When these mutations were repaired, resistance was lost and the cells became sensitive to radiation. This paper showed for the first time that evolution of resistance may occur via genetic adaptation rather than passive mechanisms based on changes in cellular proteins. We therefore hypothesized that based on the sequences of five genes known to have a role in radiation resistance in fungi, ISS-F3/F4 would appear to be more closely related to IMV00293 (Chernobyl isolate) and VEG-01C1/VEG-01C2 (ISS Z. hybrida isolates) (as they are strains also isolated from high-radiation environments) compared to 64 other F. oxysporum strains. An inferred maximum likelihood tree was constructed from concatenated sequences of rad54, rad53, rad51, rad2, and phr1 (a photolyase) found in ISS-F3, ISS-F4, IMV00293, VEG-01C1, VEG-01C2, and 64 other F. oxysporum strains. The branching observed with the radiation resistance genes was similar to that observed with EF-1α in which ISS-F3/F4 grouped together, apart from IMV00293, VEG-01C1, and VEF-01C2, which grouped together, with all five isolates being within the genetic variation of the 64 other strains included (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).

Overall, the relative abundances of GO categories for ISS-F3/F4 were similar to that observed in FOSC-3a, a clinical isolate, and Fo47, a biocontrol, non-plant-pathogenic strain. However, there were differences in the relative abundances and presence/absence of protein domains and families between ISS-F3/F4 and FOSC-3a and Fo47, highlighting the uniqueness of these strains. One such difference was the higher relative abundance of genes encoding polyketide synthase domains in ISS-F3/F4. Each PKS makes a unique polyketide, which collectively represent structurally diverse natural products with commercial significance for the pharmaceutical industries. A testament to its importance is reflected in the annual sales of pharmaceuticals derived from polyketides, which routinely reach $20 billion. For example, the anticancer drugs tetracycline and doxorubicin, the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, the antibiotics erythromycin and rifamycin, and the fungicide strobilurin are all polyketides that have been isolated from either bacteria or fungi. A BLAST search against a PKS database showed that ISS-F3/F4 had the genomic machinery to produce 13 polyketides, 11 of which have been found in other F. oxysporum strains. The two sequences in ISS-F3/F4 that did not have any matches in the PKS database did match F. oxysporum hypothetical proteins in NCBI.

Vertebrate and nonvertebrate models are well established to test pathogens for their potential virulence. For virulence testing of F. oxysporum, a host is usually immunosuppressed to make it susceptible to fungal infection. Symptoms of disseminated fusariosis caused by F. oxysporum are remarkably similar between animals and humans. They include development of invasive structures, including hypha microconidia and chlamydospores, causing massive colonization of organs, and which can cause thrombosis and necrosis. The nonvertebrate host C. elegans, a free-living soil nematode, is one of the most useful models to study the virulence of fungi and is well established by many researchers. C. elegans has an innate immune response mechanism that is activated in the response to pathogens, including fungi. A key component of the C. elegans immune response is the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. SEK-1 encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in this pathway and thus plays a vital role in pathogen resistance in C. elegans. For this reason, SEK-1 mutants are considered “immunocompromised” worms. Matricidal hatching of progeny inside the parent worms occurs in SEK-1-deficient C. elegans, and therefore, a mutation in glp-4, a locus required for normal proliferation of the germ line, is required to avoid bias effects due to progeny hatching. The glp-4 mutants are sterile at the restrictive temperature of 25°C, at which C. elegans experiments are performed.",

Since ISS-F4 demonstrated killing ability by both hypha piercing-related and -unrelated mechanisms, it is likely that it produces secreted virulence factors. It is known that secreted proteins such as RP-1-like and secreted in xylem (SIX) proteins, which are regulated by Fusarium transcription factor 1 (FTF1), are required for full virulence of F. oxysporum. Further work is required to determine if there are differences in production and regulation of the secreted factors between ISS-F3/F4 strains and if time-dependent exposure to the ISS environment may affect this regulation.",

Trimmomatic on the Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org) was used to remove the sequencing adaptors (settings: maximum mismatch, 2; accuracy of the match between the two adaptor-ligated reads, 30; accuracy of the match between any adaptor, 10) and to trim the leading and trailing ends (settings: minimum quality required to keep a base, 3). Postprocessed reads were de novo assembled using ABySS version 2.0.2 using the default settings. Different k-mer sizes ranging from 68 to 90 were tested in order to find the one that gave the highest N50 score and lowest number of scaffolds/contigs, after assembly. The k-mer size 86 gave the best results for both F3 and F4, and the resulting assemblies were used for downstream analyses.",

The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE with default parameters, and phylogeny was inferred with PhyML (1,000 bootstraps; percent bootstrap confidence is shown in red numbers in the tree). The trees were visualized using ETE 3. The effector clustering was done on only the F. oxysporum strains, using the list of 104 curated F. oxysporum effector candidate genes and the same clustering method as described in the work of van Dam et al.. Briefly, 2.5-kb regions up- and downstream of a miniature impala (mimp) transposable element were scanned for potential open reading frames (ORFs) containing a signal peptide. This procedure was previously done by van Dam et al. for 59 individual isolates of F. oxysporum, and the resulting effector candidate genes were grouped and merged into a list. Obvious false positives and transposable elements were removed, and multiple instances of the same effector were reduced to one representative. This curated list represents the “effectorome” of a varied set of plant-pathogenic formae speciales of F. oxysporum. Screening for the presence of the putative 104 effectors was done using BLASTN (as described above). A binary data matrix was generated containing presence (“1”) or absence (“0”’) of each candidate in each genome. This table was used as input for hierarchical clustering performed in R, using a Jaccard binary distance matrix and average linkage. The resulting matrix was visualized using the “heatmap3” package in R.",

Using command line BLAST (version ncbi-blast-2.4.0+), the genomes of F3 and F4 were used as the query against the “database” of unique k-mer sequences.
