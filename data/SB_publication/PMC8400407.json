            "text": "There are serious concerns about possible late radiation damage to ocular tissue from prolonged space radiation exposure, and occupational and medical procedures. This study aimed to investigate the effects of whole-body high-energy proton exposure at a single dose on apoptosis, oxidative stress, and blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity in the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) region and to compare these radiation-induced effects with those produced by fractionated dose. Six-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at an acute single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractions for a total dose of 0.5 Gy over twenty-five days. At four months following irradiation, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for histochemical analysis. Significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells were documented in the mouse retinas and ONHs that received proton radiation with a single or fractionated dose (p < 0.05). Immunochemical analysis revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for oxidative biomarker, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the retina and ONH following single or fractionated protons with more pronounced changes observed with a single dose of 0.5 Gy. BRB integrity was also evaluated with biomarkers of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), a water channel protein, a tight junction (TJ) protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and an adhesion molecule, the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1). A significantly increased expression of AQP-4 was observed in the retina following a single dose exposure compared to controls. There was also a significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and a decrease in the expression of ZO-1 in the retina. These changes give a strong indication of disturbance to BRB integrity in the retina. Interestingly, there was very limited immunoreactivity of AQP-4 and ZO-1 seen in the ONH region, pointing to possible lack of BRB properties as previously reported. Our data demonstrated that exposure to proton radiation of 0.5 Gy induced oxidative stress-associated apoptosis in the retina and ONH, and changes in BRB integrity in the retina. Our study also revealed the differences in BRB biomarker distribution between these two regions. In response to radiation insults, the cellular response in the retina and ONH may be differentially regulated in acute or hyperfractionated dose schedules.",

GCR are continuous low-dose-rate exposures composed of approximately 87% protons, 12% helium ions, and 1% high charge, high energy (HZE) particles of Z > 2 and will comprise the majority of space radiation exposure for long- duration missions beyond the Van Allen belts. The space radiation environment also consists of mixtures of high-energy protons and a minor fraction of other ions released from the sun during SPEs. During long-term deep space missions, it is anticipated that multiple SPEs will be encountered. We and others have been studying the effects of space radiation on the ocular tissue in animal models using beams of high-energy protons produced by particle accelerators. ",

            "text": "Prolonged spaceflight induces physiologic and pathologic neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities in astronauts, collectively defined as the Spaceflight Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS). However, the underlying mechanisms of the changes and factors contributing to the development of damage are unclear. Studies have shown that radiation at doses less than 1 Gy induced significant levels of retinal oxidative damage including retinal cell apoptosis. More recent reports showed optical nerve swelling in astronauts and pathological changes around the optical nerve disc including prelaminar region, lamina cribrosa, and retro-laminar region. The mechanisms and factors that contribute to the development of optic disc edema are less known and not well investigated. Recognizing the importance of the health and performance of astronauts both during and post-flight, we believe that understanding the impact of space radiation on the retina and optic nerve head (ONH) is crucial in assessing the risk to astronauts during long-duration missions, especially for future deep-space missions that will expose astronauts to greater radiation than previously encountered. However, the effects of spaceflight relevant dose and dose rate exposures to protons in the mouse retina and in the ONH have not been previously addressed. ",

The animals were maintained under a constant temperature of 68 °F with a 12-h day/night cycle. Chow and water were available ad libitum. After a one-week acclimation period, the mice were either sham irradiated or received whole-body high energy proton irradiation at a single dose of 0.5 Gy or 12 equal dose fractionations for the total dose of 0.5 Gy over 25 days. To simulate a space-like energy distribution of protons, we have used a spread-out Bragg peak set-up. To facilitate frequent use of medical treatment facilities, we selected energies and field modulations that are commonly used in cancer treatment at the J.M. Slater Proton Treatment Facility at Loma Linda University Medical Center, so that dosimetry, beam tuning, and other practical considerations would be relatively routine and reproducible. This facility uses a synchrotron built at Fermi National Laboratory upgraded and operated by Optivus Proton Therapy, Inc. as the Conforma 3000® Proton Beam Treatment System. The operating and dosimetry system is Odessey™ provided by PerMedics, Inc., of San Bernardino, California, USA.

The acute exposure was a single exposure to 0.5 Gy while for the fractionated exposures there were 12 fractions each of 4.17 cGy. The acute exposures were 38–43 s long at a dose rate of 0.74 Gy/min (clinical dose rate) while the fractions were 30–37 s long delivered at 1/10th the clinical dose rate at 0.075 Gy/min in 13–16 accelerator spills. Acute exposures were performed only during the 12th irradiation session. For each exposure, there were two 10 × 10 × 7.5 cm ventilated plastic restraint boxes each containing two freely-moving animals from the same cage. The boxes were aligned to a 20 cm circular field target placed on the patient treatment table where the beam passed vertically downward through the target avoiding self-shielding by the animals. Animals were loaded into restraint boxes in the animal care facility and transported by covered cart to the proton treatment area. Small battery-powered fans operated inside the cart to assure adequate air circulation. Total time in restraint boxes was approximately one hour. To assure equal restraint and handling stress across the three treatment groups, sham irradiated mice were subjected to the same restraint and transportation procedures during each of the 12 irradiation sessions. Similarly, acute irradiated animals were restrained and transported during each irradiation session but only exposed to protons during the last session. Total time in restraint boxes for all animals was approximately one hour on each of the twelve procedure days. Restraint stress precautions were driven by post irradiation behavioral testing needs. All procedures were approved by the Radiation Safety and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at LLU.",

            "text": "Radiation increases the activity of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Free radicals initiate a variety of cellular signaling and alter biomarkers that lead to cellular damage. 4-HNE is considered an oxidative stress biomarker for lipid peroxidation. Studies suggest that HNE plays an important role in stress-mediated signaling for cellular damage and in the mechanisms of apoptosis caused by these stress factors. Our observations show increased 4-HNE staining indicative of oxidative damage to the retina and optic nerve after proton radiation exposure compared to controls. The findings were consistent with previous findings in many research models. Radiation delivered in fractionation over 25 days showed a smaller level of HNE expression than that of a single dose in the retina and ONH. However, single- and fractionated-dose schedules appear to produce a similar level of apoptosis in the retina, while fractionated dose schedules showed a higher number of apoptotic cell damage in the ONH region. It is the general consensus that for radiotherapy, and for patients who receive high total doses, a hyperfractionated dose produces less damage to normal tissue by permitting dose recovery for damage repair to DNA and other proteins. However, our retina apoptosis data did not indicate that there was substantial repair of injury or dose recovery at a late observation time point of four months, although the total doses that were delivered to the mouse were much lower than the dose delivered to the patients in the radiotherapy. Our previous study also showed that there were no significant differences in retinal endothelial cell density following single or split dose with two equal dose fractions of 8–28 Gy. Evaluation of DNA repair of double-strand breaks in the rabbit retina, confirms that little DNA repair for dose recovery was found in the aged rabbit retinas, although retinal radiosensitivity of mice may be different compared to that of rats or rabbits. Surprisingly, a higher number of TUNEL positive cells were detected in the fractionated dose group compared to that of acute single dose exposure in the ONH region. One possible explanation is that acute radiation-induced apoptosis in the ONH may precede fractionated doses-induced apoptosis. By four months, the level of apoptotic damage already passes its peak in the retina that received single dose of 0.5 Gy, so it is less pronounced in acute irradiated group than that of fractionated dose group at four months. However, the complex regional difference in response to single and hyperfractionated dose schedule warrant further investigation. The difference in structure, cellular composition, and permeability or BRB property may contribute to the capacity of the tissue to regulate radiation response in the retina and ONH.",

            "text": "In the present study, we found that low-dose proton radiation induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. AQP-4, a water channel protein, has an important role in maintaining the integrity of BRB by forming a functional complex at astrocytic endfeet. The upregulation of AQP-4 in irradiated retinal GCL and INL indicate the potential disruption of barrier integrity and even possible edema formation. PECAM-1 is constitutively expressed on endothelial cells and leukocytes that can be highly induced in response to inflammatory situations, leading to secretion of chemokines and cytokines. PECAM-1 serves as an adhesion-signaling molecule with important roles in inflammation and leukocyte transmigration. It functions as an adhesive stress-response protein to modulate endothelial cell junctional integrity and may serve as a primary coordinator of many signaling pathways involved in cell metabolism and protein expression. Increased expression of PECAM-1 has also been shown to lead to disruption of BRB integrity after retinal vascular injury. Leukocyte migration from the blood into the retinal tissue promotes the breakdown of the BRB. The higher PECAM-1 expression in the retina following radiation exposure observed in our study may facilitate inflammatory cells to cross the BRB due to changes in the BRB permeability. The integrity of the BRB is also dependent on tight junctions (TJs). Tight junctions are transmembrane proteins and peripheral cytoplasmic proteins. ZO-1 is peripheral cytoplasmic protein and is critical in the initial formation, distinct organization, and function of TJs. Many studies have shown that vascular permeability is altered by decreasing the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1. Our previous spaceflight study also showed decreased immunoreactivity of ZO-1 expression in the retina of the flight group compared to the ground controls. Targeted irradiation of mice caused corneal endothelial cell loss, reduction of ZO-1 junctional contacts, and induction of corneal edema. The degradation of TJ-associated proteins in the retina following injury has been also shown to lead to BRB breakdown. In the current study, the decrease in ZO-1 protein expression in the retina together with the increase in water channel protein AQP-4 and adhesion molecules PECAM-1, in conjunction with increased apoptosis, suggests the BRB disturbance and prolonged tissue remodeling due to radiation exposure with single or fractionated dose schedules.

            "text": "More recently, ONH has become one of the focuses in the research surrounding SANS. Edema was observed in the prelaminar ONH in astronauts. These data points to the hypothesis that multiple factors, including fluid shifts, may lead to ONH swelling and associated intraocular alterations. Previous human and monkey studies showed that prelaminar ONH has distinct BRB properties when compared to the retina. Microvessels in the prelaminar region of the ONH lack blood-brain barrier (BBB) proteins and display nonspecific permeability, while the retina has BBB characteristic proteins but lacks permeability biomarkers. Some of our results are in agreement with their findings. In our mouse study, we found that radiation exposure induced significant changes in the expression of several proteins related to BRB integrity and function, including APQ-4, PECAM-1, and ZO-1 in the retina. The staining pattern in the ONH differs from that of the retina. Low level positive staining for BRB biomarkers including water channel protein, AQP-4 and TJ protein, ZO-1 in ONH region indicates deficient BRB function, although adhesion molecule, PECAM-1 was present in the ONH. PECAM-1 also plays an important role in mediating trans-endothelial immune cell migration and participates in key inflammatory events. Lack of BRB biomarkers in the ONH may reflect dysregulation of barrier function and vessel integrity that can cause chronic inflammation, rendering more susceptible of this region to environmental insults and pathology of ONH diseases. Further studies are needed to investigate vascular permeability as well as lymphatic and glymphatic clearance related to the accumulation of fluid in the ONH region. ",
