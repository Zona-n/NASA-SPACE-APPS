Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.",

More specifically, our lab is interested antibody repertoire dynamics within the context of spaceflight. Due to the cost of these experiments, creating datasets that can be mined by our lab or others is important. The antibody repertoire is traditionally assessed through the amplification of Ig sequences that have been isolated from sorted B cell populations. While these practices increase the likelihood of recovering rare Ig sequences and allow for the dissection of the antibody repertoire by B-cell populations, cell sorting may not be possible within the design of certain experiments. During the development of methodology to assess Ig-gene usage by mice subjected to space flight we performed multiple HTS runs to validate sample preparation, bioinformatic methodology, and reproducibility. We also wanted some background data about the Ig repertoire in the normal B6 mouse population. Knowing that there can be significant mouse-to-mouse variability in the Ig repertoire and to minimize the impact any one mouse might have in the validation data set, we chose to pool multiple mice specifically for these validation experiments. We now present these data on the splenic repertoire of conventionally housed, unimmunized, unchallenged, adult C57BL/6J mice.",

Briefly, spleens were collected from three independent pools of four, specific pathogen-free (based on the RADIL Advantage Basic profile), female, C57BL/6J mice nine-to-eleven weeks old. Animals were euthanized with isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. Briefly, mice were exposed to 400μL isoflurane in a gauze-pad enclosed in a histopathology cassette in a 450 mL chamber as was described by Huerkamp et al. Animals used in pool one were raised in the Laboratory Animal Care Services (LACS) facility (breeder stock renewed less than 2 years previous) in the Division of Biology at Kansas State University. Mice from pools two and three were received directly from Jackson Laboratories and were house in the LACS facility. Mice were fed LabDiet 5001 and had access to water and food ad libitum. Mice were maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle. Mice for pools two and three were allowed to acclimate in the vivarium for 22–31 days prior to sacrifice. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. After euthanasia, spleen tissue was processed immediately for RNA extraction with Trizol LS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pool one contained RNA from one-half of the spleen tissue while pools two and three contained RNA extracted from complete spleens. Equal concentrations of total splenic RNA (RIN>8) were pooled and mixed from each of the four mice, resulting in three final pools. At least one microgram of RNA from each pool was submitted for size selection (275–800 nucleotides) and sequencing on Illumina MiSeq at 2x300 nucleotides as described previously. Sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility using the standard Illuimna sequencing protocol, including oligo-dT-bead selection of mRNA and reverse transcription to cDNA. A reduced fragmentation time (one minute) was used to yield longer transcripts. To avoid potential primer bias and maintain a dataset that could be further mined, we did not amplify Ig sequences. The authors note that a subset of mouse pool one data was used in a methods paper presented by our group. The context and focus of that previous manuscript does not overlap with the current work.",

Briefly, sequences were imported into CLC Genomics Workbench v9.5.1 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) and cleaned to obtain high quality reads using a quality score of 97% of the sequencing containing a Phred score over 20. Both paired and merged (overlapping pairs) were mapped to V-gene segments and the loci using a match score of +1 and a mismatch score of -2 to identify potential antibody sequences. The sequences were collected and submitted to ImMunoGenTics’s (IMGT) High-V Quest for identification. Due to the chances of collecting the same read multiple times through the mapping and identification process, only one sequence per sequence ID was analyzed (procedure outlined in Rettig et al). Productive and unknown functionality sequences were identified via IMGT and used for subsequent analyses. Productive antibody sequences were defined as in frame and did not contain a stop codon. However, binding abilities were not assessed. Unknown sequences did not contain enough sequencing information to determine functionality. Gene segments were identified using IMGT’s nomenclature and using IMGT’s list of gene segments, including functional and open reading frame-defined gene segments. We implemented two procedural changes to further define the repertoire that are different from the methodology presented in Rettig et al.. In this current manuscript, when calculating the percent abundance in the repertoire, we also include V-gene segments where one or two possible V-gene segments were detected. When one single V-gene segment was detected in a sequence, it was assigned a value of one. When two potential V-gene segments were detected each gene segment was assigned a value of 0.5. The totals were then tabulated as described in Rettig et al. Additionally, CDR3 sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif for IgH (heavy-chain) were reclassified as unknown functionality, unless a class-switched isotype (IgA, IgD, IgE) was detected. CDR3 sequences for Igκ (kappa-chain) that did not fit the C-xx-F motif were classified as unknown functionality. Sequencing reads containing hyperlengthy (greater than 2x the average, or 18 amino acids (AAs)) κ-CDR3 that fit the C-xx-F motif were also removed from analysis as we believed they were falsely identified through bioinformatic or sequencing errors.",

All productive VH- and Vκ-gene segments and open reading frames listed on IMGT for the B6 mouse were analyzed and gene segments not found in our datasets were assigned a read count of zero. The IMGT productive list includes all gene segments detected in the NCBI annotation of the mouse genome. The IMGT chromosomal locations were also used for any chromosomal analysis, though not all gene segments have a defined chromosomal location. Gene segments that were not defined by location in IMGT were excluded from any chromosomal analysis. These analyses were performed on each mouse pool separately by comparing the observed raw-read count values of V-gene segments to an expected theoretical number of reads which was based on the null hypothesis that all V-gene segments will have the same number of raw reads. This value was determined by dividing the total number of antibody reads observed in a mouse pool by the number of possible gene segments. The analysis of gene-segment usage by chromosomal location was performed by dividing gene segments into four quadrants based on nucleotide position. A quadrant was defined as one-fourth of the entire locus, as determined by number of nucleotides in the locus. Gene segment location was defined as the first nucleotide of the gene segment. A Chi-square analysis was performed on each mouse pool by summing the raw-read counts of all gene segments containing a 5’ nucleotide position within each quadrant and comparing the observed total reads within a quadrant to an expected theoretical number of reads for each quadrant which was based on the null hypothesis that the number of raw reads is not statistically different between defined quadrants.",

However, when compared to serum data, even in naïve mice, there was a high level of circulating IgGs, which was not reflected in spleen tissue sequencing, which instead shows very high levels of IgM.

Using a model of capture-recapture methodology, the Chapman estimator, and the number of common heavy-chain CDR3 sequences seen in each of our samplings, we estimated our B-cell pool to range from 1.5–14 x 106 cells. If we assume that there are 5 x 106 B cells in a nine to eleven-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse spleen, and our mouse pools were made up of four spleens, this estimate of the possible splenic B-cell pool is reasonably accurate, especially if we take into account some of the CDR3 sequences were detected multiple times (multiple B cells with the same IgH).",

While some of the differences arose from expected depth-of-sequencing issues, we unexpectedly found that discrepancies also resulted from gene segments being detected in the unamplified data set not detected in the amplified data sets (Rettig et al., In Revision).

Although our approach was necessary to accommodate requirements of a separate investigation, we are aware that the inclusion of extraneous cells as result of using whole tissue could reduce the recovery of rare B-cell clones. In addition, some bias might be introduced because of cell subpopulation stability and frequency in whole spleen tissue. Nevertheless, in spite of the limitations of our methodology, it appears that the repertoire we detected correlated with mouse studies that have used selection and amplification methods of various kinds. For example, Collins et al. detected five of the same VH genes that we detected among our highest 10 used VH-gene segments. JH2 was also the most frequently detected in both of our studies. Yang and Kaplinski detected V-gene segment use that paralleled our findings with V1-26 identified by them as the most frequently used.",

Aoki-Ota et al. also noted Vκ-gene segment skewing in their assessment of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice.
