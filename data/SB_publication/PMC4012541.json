In order to investigate the role of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining hepatocyte differentiated functions ex vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured either as monolayers on tissue culture dishes (TCD) or as 3D aggregates in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors. Global gene expression analyses revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those upregulated during liver development and liver regeneration. Instead, they represented a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes with significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in their promoters. Expression of Hnf4a and many of its downstream target genes were significantly increased in RWV cultures as compared to TCD. Conversely, there was concomitant suppression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in RWV cultures that were induced in TCDs. These findings illustrate the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function and serve as a basis for rational design of biomaterials that aim to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.",

Sustained differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture could be harnessed for drug toxicity screening or to improve the efficacy of extracorporeal liver-assist devices. In addition, 3D aggregation may facilitate transplantation of hepatocytes kept in culture, which would be particularly useful for hepatocytes derived from pluripotent stem cells.",

Using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) system, we previously showed that one important factor for sustaining differentiated functions of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line is sustained 3D cell-cell interactions. RWVs are rotational bioreactors with a gas permeable membrane that, when in operation, are completely filled with culture media so that it functionally rotates as a solid-body around a horizontal axis. This creates a suspension culture environment with minimal fluid shear stress and turbulence, allowing cells to co-localize and self-aggregate with 3D spatial freedom. Studies have shown that hepatocyte spheroids cultured under these conditions could develop into larger sizes with less hypoxic limitations to the inner core compared to stationary culture. Human hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells co-cultured within RWVs demonstrated formation of complex 3D micro-architectures, including microvilli, bile canaliculi, and sinusoidal fenestrations.",

Self-aggregated cellular spheroids are the building blocks for organ printing, a bottom up synthesis approach to tissue engineering. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate hepatocyte functions within 3D spheroids is critical for the optimization of organ function within a printed liver. Moreover, hepatocyte spheroids generated within RWVs allow investigation of the biological effects of 3D cell-cell interactions without the influence of contacting scaffolds, surfaces, or carriers. In this study, we performed global gene expression and promoter region analyses on primary mouse hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (TCDs) or RWVs to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture.",

Of the 293 genes, 261 were in the oPOSSUM database (http://www.cisreg.ca) and included in the analysis. Table 3 lists the top 10 over-represented TFBSs in genes significantly upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes compared with a background gene set. TFBSs with a Z-score > 10 and Fisher score < 0.01 were empirically validated to identify functionally relevant transcription factors within a set of co-expressed genes. Using these criteria, only the top 2 transcription factors, HNF4α (Hnf4a) and chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 1 (TFCOUP1), were identified as functionally important regulators of the genes upregulated in RWV-cultured hepatocytes. Remarkably, 52% of the analyzed genes (138 genes) contained Hnf4a TFBSs in their promoter regions. Hnf4a is known as a master regulator of hepatocyte-specific functions. Interestingly, TFCOUP1 and Hnf4a binding motifs are highly related and TFCOUP1 has been shown to act as a negative regulator of Hnf4a transactivation. These analyses suggest that Hnf4a is particularly important for maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in RWV-cultured hepatocytes.",

In order to determine whether mesenchymal molecular pathways may be concomitantly suppressed in hepatocyte 3D aggregates, we measured expression of several important markers of EMT at 24h of culture in TCDs and RWVs, before potential overgrowth of contaminating non-parenchymal cells (<10% of the purified hepatocyte population, data not shown) may confound the results. Notably, Snail expression was significantly higher in TCD cultures by 2.7±0.6 fold at 24h as compared to RWV cultures. Vimentin (Vim), a cytoskeletal intermediate filament widely used as a marker of EMT, was expressed 6.6±1.3 fold higher in monolayer cultures compared to 3D aggregate cultures. Furthermore, expression of lysyl oxidase-like 2 (Loxl2), another inducer of EMT, was also significantly upregulated by 33.3±6.5 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs (Figure 6). Expression of E-cadherin (Cdh1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), adhesion molecules characteristic of epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively, were not significantly different between TCD and RWV cultures (data not shown). Instead, several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in hepatocyte monolayer cultures were significantly upregulated in TCDs compared to RWVs. These included filamin A (Flna), an actin-binding protein that interacted with vimentin to regulate cell adhesion and spreading, whose expression was increased 3.7±0.4 fold in TCDs compared to RWVs. Expression of α1-actin (Acta1), an actin isoform expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, was greatly increased by 25.9±4.2 fold in monolayer cultures as compared to 3D aggregates. Finally, expression of β-tropomyosin (Tpm2), an isoform primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts, was also significantly increased by 6.9±1.5 fold in TCD-cultured hepatocytes (Figure 6). The significantly higher expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes in TCD as compared to RWV cultures at 24h suggests that these molecular pathways are induced in hepatocyte monolayers and suppressed in 3D aggregates.",

The pattern of differential gene expression was distinct from molecular pathways induced during hepatocyte differentiation in organogenesis or hepatocyte proliferation after two-thirds hepatectomy. Remarkably, TFBS analysis revealed that more than 50% of the genes upregulated in RWV cultures had Hnf4a binding sites in their promoter regions. Hnf4a binding sites were the most significantly over-represented TFBS in genes differentially upregulated in RWV cultures and expression of Hnf4a itself was significantly upregulated in 3D aggregates compared to monolayers. While cell-matrix interactions dominate in hepatocyte monolayers cultured on collagen-coated TCDs, 3D cell-cell interactions dominate within self-aggregated spheroids generated in RWVs. These findings suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for sustained expression of Hnf4a, which in turn plays a key role in maintaining differentiated hepatocyte functions in 3D aggregates.",

It can activate gene transcription in the absence of exogenous ligand, though it has a hydrophobic binding pocket and linoleic acid may be a potential endogenous ligand. Hnf4a is known to have essential roles in normal liver development, maintaining mature liver functions, and in inducing hepatic differentiation in stem cells and fibroblasts. Targeted disruption of Hnf4a in mice led to embryonic lethality due to failure to complete gastrulation. Tetraploid complementation of Hnf4a−/− embryos demonstrated that Hnf4a was essential for hepatocyte differentiation during liver development. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in fetal hepatocytes showed that Hnf4a was required for normal morphological and functional differentiation of hepatocytes and development of hepatic epithelium. In addition to its critical role during liver development, Hnf4a is also required to maintain normal metabolic functions of mature hepatocytes. Conditional knock-out of Hnf4a in mature hepatocytes, generated by mating Hnf4aloxp/loxp mice with mice expressing Cre under the albumin promoter, showed that Hnf4a was an essential regulator of lipid homeostasis, bile acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, and xenobiotic metabolism. Moreover, ectopic expression of Hnf4a is required for conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells that have mature hepatocyte functions, including the ability to reconstitute liver tissue after transplantation. Over-expression of Hnf4a in human embryonic stem cell and induced pluripotent stem cell derived hepatoblasts was able to significantly improve the mature hepatocyte functions of differentiated cells. Finally, genome-wide studies demonstrated that Hnf4a bound the promoters of liver-specific genes significantly more often than other liver-enriched transcription factors, indicating that Hnf4a was one of the most important transcriptional master regulators of hepatocyte function.",

            "text": "Our global gene expression and promoter region analyses indicate that Hnf4a also plays a central role in maintaining hepatocyte-specific functions in 3D culture. Three-dimensional culture has been shown to improve hepatocyte differentiated functions but the underlying mechanisms of how 3D culture induced these effects were previously unknown. Our data suggest that 3D cell-cell interactions are important for maintaining expression of the master regulator Hnf4a at a higher level compared to monolayer culture. Increased expression of Hnf4a in 3D culture in turn leads to sustained expression of a wide range of downstream hepatocyte-specific functional genes as well as improved overall metabolic function of the hepatocyte. Several gene targets correlating with mature hepatocyte functions significantly upregulated in RWVs are known direct targets of Hnf4a (e.g. Baat, F7, and Gys2) or have Hnf4a binding sites within their promoter regions (e.g. Akr1c19). There are also functional genes highly upregulated in RWVs that do not possess Hnf4a TFBS (e.g. Hfe2 and Lepr), suggesting that Hnf4a may have an indirect role in controlling expression of these genes or that other transcriptional networks may be involved. Nevertheless, our analyses reveal that Hnf4a is likely the major transcriptional effector for maintaining differentiated functions of hepatocytes in 3D culture.",

            "text": "Conversely, one can consider the signals induced in monolayer cultures that may be repressed in 3D aggregates. Monolayer culture on TCD is a highly artificial environment in which cell-matrix interactions dominate and cells are spread against a stiff two-dimensional (2D) surface. Under these conditions, we found that hepatocytes significantly increased expression of mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes compared to 3D aggregate culture. Hepatocytes cultured on collagen-coated TCDs have been shown to undergo fibroblastoid dedifferentiation and express mesenchymal cell characteristics. Our results suggest that this transition towards a mesenchymal phenotype may be inhibited in hepatocytes cultured in 3D. We showed that while hepatocytes acquired spindle-like projections after several days of culture on TCDs, they maintained a round shape in 3D aggregates. Several EMT inducers and mesenchymal cell markers (Snail, Vim, and Loxl2) were highly upregulated in TCDs as compared RWVs. In addition, expression levels of several cytoskeletal genes not previously described in monolayer culture (Acta1, Tpm2, and Flna) were also significantly increased in TCDs compared to RWVs. There is evidence that Hnf4a actively represses the mesenchymal program in hepatocytes in conjunction with maintaining hepatocyte-specific differentiated functions. Hnf4a was shown to bind to the Vim and Snail promoters in hepatocytes and to directly repress transcription of Snail. Silencing of Hnf4a was sufficient to upregulate expression of both Vim and Snail. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Hnf4a induced the reverse mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) process in fibroblasts. Therefore, one interpretation of our data is that stiff 2D matrix interactions in monolayer culture inhibited expression of Hnf4a that in turn led to decreased expression of hepatocyte functional genes as well as upregulation of EMT inducers that promoted mesenchymal transition. Mechanotransduction, in which cells biochemically integrate mechanical matrix and substrate cues of the micro-environment, is an important determinant of cell function and behavior. Future investigation in our lab will further characterize the differential molecular signals in monolayer versus 3D aggregate culture that lead to inhibited or maintained expression of Hnf4a in hepatocytes.",

Our findings suggest that biomaterials aimed to augment hepatocyte differentiated functions should maximize 3D cell-cell interactions and minimize stiff 2D substrate contacts. As self-aggregated hepatocyte spheroids may be considered biomaterials in their own right and used in applications such as organ printing, our data inform how tissue engineering strategies utilizing hepatocyte spheroids may be optimized. Moreover, we show that 3D hepatocyte cultures would be advantageous for in vitro applications in which the differentiated state of hepatocytes is critical, such as drug toxicity studies. Along these lines, 3D aggregate cultures may also be effective in improving differentiation of hepatocyte-like cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, which would be beneficial for efforts aimed at liver disease modeling in vitro.",
