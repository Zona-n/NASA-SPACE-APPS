Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKP) is a subgroup of K. pneumoniae, which has gained attention due to its global dissemination, its capacity to cause invasive infections in community settings among immunocompetent individuals, and its escalating antibiotic resistance levels. Our study presents the first comprehensive phenotypic and genotypic analysis including mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae offered insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, disinfectant resistance, and MGEs. All isolates were part of emerging pathogenic lineages with K. quasipneumoniae ST138 presenting spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, possibly due to its genotypic profile encoding for numerous resistance genes to disinfectants and heavy metals. We also report on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae, belonging to the emerging high-risk ST101 clone, aboard the ISS. A potential dissemination of hvKp strains on ISS might pose a risk to the immunocompromised crew members. Moreover, MGEs containing virulent loci could enable horizontal gene transfer to other benign microorganisms on the ISS, possibly enhancing their virulence potential. Additionally, some Klebsiella genomes exhibited genetic divergence from their respective lineages, which we hypothesize results from the unique spaceflight associated environmental pressures. These findings underscore the need to monitor microbial communities in space to comprehend their survival mechanisms and implications for human health.",

While bacteria's adaptability during spaceflight remains elusive, recent research suggests that it may be species and even clone-specific. Considering the documented spaceflight-induced suppression of the human immune system, a deper understanding of the genomics of potential human pathogens in space could shed light on species and lineages of medical astromicrobiological significance. In this study, we used hybrid assembly methods and comparative genomics to deliver a comprehensive genomic characterization of 10 Klebsiella isolates retrieved from the ISS. Our analysis unveiled that Klebsiella quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates both spatial and temporal persistence aboard the ISS, showing evidence of genomic divergence from its Earth-based ST138 lineage. Moreover, we characterized plasmids from Klebsiella species of ISS origin, which harbored genes for disinfectant resistance and enhanced thermotolerance, suggestin possible adaptive advantages. Furthermore, we identified a mobile genetic element containing a hypervirulence-associated locus belonging to a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate of the “high-risk” ST101 clone. Our work provides insights into the adaptability and persistence of Klebsiella species during spaceflight, highlighting the importance of understanding the dynamics of potential pathogenic bacteria in such environments.",

Its multidrug resistance (MDR), extended drug resistance (XDR), and association with hypervirulent (hvKp) lineages, which cause outbreaks in both community and healthcare environments, make it a notable concern. The dispersal of hvKp lineage strains is of increasing concern to the medical community. HvKp differs from classic K. pneumoniae (cKp) due to its ability to infect immunocompetent individuals in community settings. Infections associated with hvKp commonly affect multiple sites due to metastatic spread. Although there is not a clear definition for hvKp, there are several siderophore virulence factors (VFs) reported to be associated with a hvKp pathotype, mainly aerobactin (iuc), salmochelin (iro), and yersiniabactin (ybt). Recently, Kleborate, a genotyping tool has been developed to assess and quantify virulence among the K. pneumoniae species complex using a five-tier scoring system based on the presence of key virulence-associated loci.These virulence loci are commonly identified on mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as self-mobilizable plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Within K. pneumoniae populations, ICEKp is known to mobilize the ybt locus, which encodes for the key iron scavenging virulence factor yersiniabactin along with its receptor. Besides virulence factors, capsular serotypes K1 and K2 are more frequently encountered in hvKp. Other capsular types, such as KL106, are associated with globally disseminated pathogenic K. pneumoniae lineages, although their structures remain undetermined.",

These Klebsiella isolates were retrieved from the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC), Cupola, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module, Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), and Lab 3 of the ISS. Using culture-independent methods, it has been reported that K. pneumoniae can be identified in multiple locations on the ISS, with documented succession over time. K. pneumoniae exhibited noticeable persistence between different flights among propidium monoazide-treated surface samples. Additionally, metabolic modeling indicated that Klebsiella species play a key role in the ISS microbiome, benefiting co-existing microorganisms (e.g., Pantoea species). It was also found that K. pneumoniae displays parasitic interactions with Aspergillus species and amensalistic interactions with Penicillium species. The overall importance of understanding the genomic background, evolution, and persistence of potentially pathogenic microorganisms during spaceflight, in terms of medical astromicrobiology, has also been recently discussed.",

K. pneumoniae ST101 is widely associated with hypervirulent pathotypes. Overall, the ST101 lineage genomes exhibited high genetic similarity (ANI > 99.4%; Fig. 2A) and are predominantly associated with Europe and South-East Asia (Fig. 2B). F3-2P (2), the strain from the ISS, is most closely related to ERR985162, a genome retrieved from sewage wastewater in the UK in 2014, with an ANI of 99.86%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that F3-2P (2) belongs to a distinct sub-clade within the ST101 lineage, along with 41 other genomes (Fig. 2C). Out of the 696 K. pneumoniae ST101 isolates reported worldwide, 87.07% (606/696) were found to carry the ybt gene cluster, which is a determinant of virulence associated with the presence of yersiniabactin, suggesting that yersiniabactin plays a key role in the pathogenicity of this clone. Among these isolates, only nine encoded for additional siderophore virulence factors such as colibactin or aerobactin. Moreover, 98.2% (595/606) of the ybt-positive genomes encoded for ybt9, as part of a horizontally acquired ICEKp3. The integrative conjugative element ICEKp5, which was identified in the ISS isolate F3-2P (2) and carries the ybt14 locus, is a rarity, identified in only four other ST101 genomes.",

The ST101 clone has been implicated in numerous outbreaks of bloodstream infections worldwide, including in southern Italy and India. With isolates reported from over 33 countries, ST101 poses a persistent public health concern and ST101 induced infections have been associated with 11% increased mortality compared to non-ST101 infections. Widely disseminated, high-risk clones like ST101 are known to be able to horizontally acquire hypervirulence gene clusters, potentially precipitating the emergence of hypervirulent clonal lineages.

Furthermore, the hypervirulent, multimetal resistance, and thermotolerant genomic profile of the K. pneumoniae F3-2P (2) strain could possibly allow it to evade the existing disinfecting protocols aboard the ISS.

            "text": "The persistence of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 in the ISS environment was evidenced by the isolation of seven strains over 18 months from three different locations (Permanent Multipurpose Module, Cupola, and WHC). Despite the spatial and temporal distribution of their collection, the ST138 strains showed remarkable genetic similarity, suggesting the possible propagation of a single clone in the closed system for a prolonged period. The genomes of the ST138 isolates shared several chromosomal genetic determinants of resistace, including these encoding for resistance to quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), peroxide, fosmidomycin, methyl viologen, tellurite, nickel, cobalt, zinc, and the multiple stress-resistance protein BhsA encoded by bhsA. These determinants may confer adaptability advantages to the ST138 lineage during spaceflight, given most cleaning agents and disinfectants contain several of these heavy metals and QACs. On Earth, K. quasipneumoniae ST138 strains have been isolated from untreated and treated water in a wastewater treatment plant in Slovenia. ESBL cefotaximase (CTXM-9)-producing strains of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 have also been reported to cause community-onset infections in China. Overall, K. quasipneumoniae ST138 shows temporal and spatial persistence within the ISS environment, more than any other Klebsiella lineage. The ISS K. quasipneumoniae ST138 strains lacked any MGEs and, therefore, their adaptability advantage is likely ntrinsic. Further research is required to elucidate the properties of this lineage, which allow it to adapt and propagate to the high-pressure environment of the ISS.",

            "text": " K. aerogenes strain IIIF7SW-P1 (ST103) was isolated from the ISS Lab3 in 2015. This strain belongs to the globally rare K. aerogenes ST103 lineage, with only five strains deposited in the Pathogenwatch database, all of which are associated with UTIs and reported in the USA. K. aerogenes IIIF7SW-P1 presented phenotypic resistance to ampicillin and the second generation cephamycin cefoxitin as expected, given the intrinsic resistance of K. aerogenes due to the presence of a chromosomal ampC. The isolate was susceptible to the third generation cephalosporin cefpodoxime and to the cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid combination tested. This is in liaison with the literature supporting that only overproduction of AmpC is linked with resistance to third generation cephalosporins. Interestingly, IIIF7SW-P1 harbored two uncharacterized plasmids, one of which (pIIF7SW-P1_1) was predicted to be mobilizable and contained the pilL gene responsible for thin pilus biogenesis. PilL is known to promote bacterial adhesion and colonization, providing a selective advantage in the high-selective-pressure environment of the ISS. The second plasmid (pIIF7SW-P1_2) was a high copy plasmid, harboring the heat shock gene htrC, which has been linked with increased thermoresistance in E. coli. The genetic makeup of IIIF7SW-P1 suggests that it may have acquired plasmids enabling it to survive and persist in the challenging conditions of the ISS, which warrants further investigation.",

This study reports on the genomic makeup of 10 Klebsiella isolates, revealing an abundance of heavy metal and QAC-resistance genes amongst the genomes, similar to the ones seen in clinical settings where the use of disinfectants is intense. However, clinically relevant ESBLs and carbapenemase-producing genes were notably absent. This study reports on the isolation of a yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae from a human-associated pathogenic lineage aboard the ISS as well as on the persistence and possible genomic divergence of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 isolates. The prevalence and seemingly adaptability of K. quasipneumoniae ST138 in spaceflight conditions should be considered for further investigation. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to map and understand the prevalent Klebsiella lineages that could persist during prolonged spaceflight. Ongoing surveillance of potentially problematic STs is feasible on the ISS due to its small crew size and could help mitigate associated risks. These efforts will aid in developing suitable countermeasures for eradicating potentially problematic pathogens in closed habitats for future human missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.",

Suitable aliquots (100 µL) of each sample were plated on Reasoner’s 2A agar in duplicate and incubated at 25°C for 7 days, and well-matured colonies were picked, archived in semisolid R2A (agar media diluted 1:10), and stored at room temperature. A loopful of purified microbial culture was directly subjected to PCR. The targeted fragment was amplified (colony PCR) to amplify the 1.5 kb 16S rRNA gene to identify the bacterial strains. The following primers were used for the 16S rRNA gene amplification: the forward primer, 27F (5′-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3′), and the reverse primer, 1492R (5′-GGT TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT T-3′). The PCR conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 50 s, annealing at 55°C for 50 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min 30 s and finalized by extension at 72°C for 10 min. The sequencing was performed using 27F and 1492R primers, and the sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro from DNAStar Lasergene Package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI, USA).
