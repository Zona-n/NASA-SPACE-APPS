            "text": "It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.",

            "text": "The spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflight-induced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflight-induced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success. Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts. Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified. However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging. Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB). Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function. Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion. Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion. Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.",

            "text": "The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption, the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses. Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage. Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling. However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth “omics” approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact.",

Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inflammation related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two upregulated genes, H2-T23 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398) and SOX4 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238).

Genes supporting innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of these observed changes are in line with our previous findings in the brains exposed to simulated spaceflight condition. Following combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are significantly altered. Gene expression in the brain that was analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were downregulated. However, in contrary to our findings, many genes related to stress, immune response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory response were significantly upregulated in their study.

Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the innate immune system in the brain and play an important role in cytokine production. Their activation is closely associated with environmental stress and microglial dysfunction is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases. CSF1R (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001037859) is a gene coding for a cell-surface receptor which binds to colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529) and interleukin-34 (IL-34) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001135100).

Given these findings we suggest that flight mice may have a reduced capacity to generate microglial cells in the nervous system. MERTK (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587) creates a kinase protein in innate immune cells which mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells and acts as a negative regulator of inflammation.

            "text": "Gene expression profiling data were analyzed using nSolver analysis and the advanced analysis module software. Advanced analysis module software uses open-source R program for pathway scoring and gene-set enrichment analysis. Using the Reactome pathway database annotations, pathway scores are derived by calculating the first principle component of pathway genes’ normalized expression and data are summarized from changes of a gene set within a given pathway into a single score. To further analyze the associated pathways of the DEGs, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis was performed using biological process database to identify the annotated sets of genes based on the biological processes in which they participate. Significantly differential expression genes were presented in the tables with individual genes using log10 (p value) andlog2 fold change compared to the GC group. Pathview module was used to display upregulated genes or downregulated genes overlaid on KEGG pathways. For DEG and pathway analysis, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant between FLT and GC groups by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test.",
