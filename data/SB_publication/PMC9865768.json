            "text": "As generalist parasitoid wasps, Leptopilina heterotoma are highly successful on many species of fruit flies of the genus Drosophila. The parasitoids produce specialized multi-strategy extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures in their venom. Proteomic analysis identified several immunity-associated proteins, including the knottin peptide, LhKNOT, containing the structurally conserved inhibitor cysteine knot (ICK) fold, which is present in proteins from diverse taxa. Our structural and docking analysis of LhKNOT’s 36-residue core knottin fold revealed that in addition to the knottin motif itself, it also possesses a Cation–Polar–Cation (CPC) clip. The CPC clip motif is thought to facilitate antimicrobial activity in heparin-binding proteins. Surprisingly, a majority of ICKs tested also possess the CPC clip motif, including 75 bona fide plant and arthropod knottin proteins that share high sequence and/or structural similarity with LhKNOT. Like LhKNOT and these other 75 knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide, a canonical target gene of the fly’s Toll-NF-kappa B immune pathway, contains this CPC clip motif. Together, our results suggest a possible defensive function for the parasitoid LhKNOT. The prevalence of the CPC clip motif, intrinsic to the cysteine knot within the knottin proteins examined here, suggests that the resultant 3D topology is important for their biochemical functions. The CPC clip is likely a highly conserved structural motif found in many diverse proteins with reported heparin binding capacity, including amyloid proteins. Knottins are targets for therapeutic drug development, and insights into their structure–function relationships will advance novel drug design.",

To suppress host immunity, Leptopilina females introduce venom factors into their larval hosts during oviposition. The well-defined innate immune mechanisms in Drosophila provide a valuable context to study the effects of these wasp venom factors. Infection by the specialist L. boulardi activates the humoral and cellular immune arms controlled by the fly’s conserved Toll-NF-κB signaling pathway. The expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes such as drosomycin is activated after L. boulardi infection. Toll-NF-κB signaling also controls blood cell division and development, steps that control encapsulation and death of wasp eggs. In contrast, infection by the generalist L. heterotoma suppresses both immune pathways, and almost all larval blood cells are destroyed by factors in the wasp venom.",

These immune-suppressive organelles include more than 350 proteins and possess a proteomic profile of eukaryotic microvesicles and a plethora of immunity-related proteins. LhKNOT adopts the “Inhibitor Cysteine Knot” (knottin) motif. The knottin motif is broadly conserved in a range of taxa, from plants to snails. These small peptides (<60 residues) are functionally diverse.

The knottin motif occurs when cysteine residues are observed in a C1-C2-C3-C4-C5-C6 pattern (where “-“ represents a number of highly variable residues). Disulfide bridges are then formed in a similarly conserved fashion (C1-C4, C2-C5, and C3-C6), resulting in C1-C4 and C2-C5 forming a macrocycle, while C3-C6 occurs within this macrocycle, resulting in a “knotted” topology. As this knotted topology largely hinges on the conservation of the six cysteine residues, the knottin motif allows for significant variation in the overall sequence. The combination of their small size, high tolerance of sequence variance, and observed structural stability has made knottins a popular scaffold for drug design, potentially even for cancer treatments.",

The LhKNOT model contains a CPC clip, capable of interacting with heparin, a negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) of significant medical value. LhKNOT also has the potential for interacting with other GAGs, such as keratan sulfate (a GAG that is highly sulfated, similar to heparin) and hyaluronic acid (the single GAG representative that does not require sulfation). Furthermore, structural homologs of LhKNOT (i.e., bona fide knottin motif proteins) also possess the CPC clip motif that can dock with heparin. Surprisingly, like LhKNOT and these other bona fide knottin proteins, even the Drosophila Drosomycin antifungal peptide shares this CPC clip motif in its structure. This motif was also identified in 41 out of 46 additional LhKNOT homologs from L. heterotoma, L. boulardi, and Ganaspis spp. wasps successfully on D. melanogaster. These in silico-based observations suggest that the CPC clip motif, inherent in many knottins, may provide the structural basis for modifying immune or virulence functions. We speculate on a possible antimicrobial or virulence-related function for the wasp LhKNOT. The abundance of the knottin fold and its concurrence with the CPC clip motif in most of the newly identified knottin peptides from three Drosophila parasitoids suggests an important yet to be determined role for them in parasitoid physiology and/or in the host–parasite interactions.",

The top match for LhKNOT in the nr database was an antimicrobial peptide from the common beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, while the top hit in the TSA database was an antimicrobial peptide from the wheat curl mite Aceria tosichella. The conservation was most prominent in the region of the only sequence motif associated with LhKNOT, the cysteine knotted ‘antifungal peptide’ signature (pfam11410 domain, E = 2.8 × 10−3).

            "text": "The typical structural fold of a knottin peptide is defined by six cysteines involved in three disulfide bonds to form a cysteine-knotted three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. An important characteristic of this fold is the connectivity of the cysteine residues to form the disulfide bridges and the disulfide bridge of cysteines 3 and 6 going through disulfides 1–4 and 2–5 to make a special disulfide through disulfide knot (Figure 1A,C). This disulfide, through a disulfide knot feature, distinguishes the knottin fold from other cysteine knot proteins. Other than the conserved cysteines, the rest of the amino acid sequence can be quite variable, and therefore, only a limited number of knottins are identified by sequence similarity approaches for LhKNOT (see the previous section and Supplementary Table S1). Fold recognition algorithms and template-based modeling approaches, on the other hand, retrieved several diverse knottins as suitable candidates for modeling LhKNOT. Among the various LhKNOT models generated, the best model was a multi-template-based model of LhKNOT created using the program HHpred with structural restraints derived from the top three templates, Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J), omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA), and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC). Knowledge-based energy profiles calculated using ProSA-web for this selected model showed low energies and a z-score of −4.53, which is comparable to solved structures. Verify3D assessed this multi-template-based model with a passing score (100.00% of the residues in the model have an averaged 3D-1D score greater than or equal to 0.2). The VoroMQA score of 0.325 is likely a reflection of the small size of the peptide and the scores of the templates were in the same range (Supplementary Figure S1). This multi-template-based model typifies the knottin fold with three antiparallel beta strands, constrained by disulfide bridges and the expected connectivity of disulfide bridges (Figure 1D). KNOTER3D, a tool in the KNOTTIN Database corroborated that this model has a bona fide knottin fold and confirmed the previously identified disulfide bonding pattern in Figure 1D.",

A structural superposition of the cactus knottin and LhKNOT showed that the two structures are highly similar, with an overall difference of less than 2Å. Docking analysis of LhKNOT with heparin, using ClusPro’s specific parameters for heparin as a ligand, revealed that for LhKNOT, the polar interactions fitting the CPC clip motif occur in residues R1-S3-R14 (Figure 3A). Measured distances (both between alpha-carbons and centers of mass of participating residue side chains) differed from those of the CPC clip by less than 1Å, suggesting the presence of a putative CPC clip in LhKNOT (Figure 3B).

This structural motif, termed a “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif”, is also found in other host-defense proteins such as the antibacterial insect defensin A, scorpion toxins, plant thionins, and antifungal plant defensins. Given the known antimicrobial function of Drosomycin and its related “cysteine stabilized αβ-motif”, we examined the possibility of a common basis for antimicrobial activity and shared structure–function relationships with LhKNOT to better understand the potential significance of this motif in LhKNOT in the context of host defense. Despite a slightly different structural fold, Drosomycin overlays within an RMSD of 2.2Å of both LhKNOT and pB1 (Figure 5A). When the previous CPC clip analysis was extended to Drosomycin, the results revealed the presence of the CPC clip motif in Drosomycin as well. The CPC clip motif in Drosomycin (R6-S4-K38) falls within a 2Å deviation of the motif parameters (Figure 5B, Supplementary Table S5). Additionally, surface electrostatics of Drosomycin confirmed the putative CPC clip’s formation of a cationic binding pocket as also observed for LhKNOT and other knottins (Figure 5C, Supplementary Table S5). These results suggest that there may be similarity in the mode of action of Drosomycin and LhKNOT and that the biochemistry embedded in this structural motif may drive antimicrobial function in both peptides.",

In silico methods facilitate broad analysis of potential structure–function correlations for such interesting folds.

It has immunity- and signaling-related functions in wound healing and cancer and is used as an anticoagulant. GAGs are present on animal cell surfaces and have become an increasingly popular target of studies ranging from clinical to cosmetic. The CPC clip motif of heparin-binding proteins is considered to be the minimum required motif for heparin-binding affinity and is defined by specific spatial relationships between three residues, two cationic (Arg/Lys) and one polar (Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr, Tyr). This CPC clip motif is defined by distances between both the α carbons of the involved residues as well as the distances between the centers of mass of the involved residues. Heparin-binding proteins are known to interact promiscuously with other negatively charged substrates, most notably the surface membranes of microbes. As a result, heparin-binding proteins can exhibit antimicrobial activity to varying degrees. While the precise mechanisms of this antimicrobial potential are not well defined, it has been hypothesized that the CPC clip may facilitate these protein–microbe interactions. New potential roles of heparin binding are emerging, such as in the potential therapeutic interventions for amyloidogenesis, so understanding the structural determinants of the CPC clip in diverse proteins may be key to delineating the mechanism of the interaction and its disruption.",

Thus, the CPC clip motif may fit the criteria for both these requirements. Our discovery of this CPC clip motif not only in LhKNOT but also in 75 other related or unrelated knottin proteins (Supplementary Table S5) suggests that this CPC clip motif may be a highly conserved feature of the knottin proteins. The coincident occurrence of the CPC clip motif within the cysteine knot structure in diverse proteins suggests that the CPC clip motif itself may underlie the antimicrobial function. However, because this structural motif is also identified in offensive knottins (Supplementary Table S5), it may also serve a more general role via this more generalized CPC clip interaction motif.",

Our structural analysis of the wasp LhKNOT and its similarities with Drosophila Drosomycin offers possible insights into the L. heterotoma’s ability to broadly suppress Toll-NF-κB pathway in D. melanogaster and yet succeed on immune-compromised hosts. In the absence of a functional Toll immune pathway, and consequently without Drosomycin production, Drosophila larvae can often succumb to opportunistic pathogens. LhKNOT’s putative antimicrobial activities might defend the host from opportunistic microbial pathogens in wasp-infected, immune-compromised host larvae and developing pupae. Alternatively, similar to Drosomycin, LhKNOT could induce hemocyte apoptosis. L. heterotoma EVs enter hemocytes after infection, and their activities within EVs compromise encapsulation.",

Heparin sulfate GAGs in flies serve as growth factor receptors and participate in creating and maintaining morphogenic gradients. The CPC clip has also been shown to associate promiscuously with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Bacterial LPS, being major surface components of Gram-negative bacteria, are extremely potent stimulators of the innate immune response in various eukaryotic species including insects. GAGs in Drosophila also control the binding of α C protein, a virulence determinant of group B streptococcus. Thus, it is possible that a CPC clip containing LhKNOT and Drosomycin (and possibly other fly AMPs, such as Defensin) can modulate immune signaling (and/or binding to the pathogen’s virulence proteins), similarly affecting the bacterial pathogen/metazoan parasite outcome.

The sequence was further analyzed using the signal sequence prediction software SignalP-5.0 (; accessed on 6 April 2018) and Phobius (; accessed on 6 April 2018) to identify the location of the signal sequence and allow for a more accurate characterization of the peptide. The mature peptide of 36 amino acids (with the predicted signal sequence, residues 1–24, removed) was used for further analysis. The secondary structure of the peptide was predicted using the meta-server Sympred (; accessed on 6 April 2018) and analyzed to confirm its correspondence to the expected secondary structure for a knottin fold: an initial alpha-helical segment (predicted signal sequence) followed by three anti-parallel beta strands.",

Three structural homologs with the knottin-like fold Alo-3 (PDB: 1Q3J), omega-agatoxin-IVA (PDB: 1IVA), and PAFP-S (PDB: 1DKC) were identified as top candidates and used as templates in model building programs. The predicted model for LhKNOT was evaluated by Verify3D (; accessed on 18 April 2018), VoroMQA (; accessed on 18 April 2018), and Prosa-web (; accessed on 18 April 2018). Evaluating small peptides with standard evaluation tools can have limitations. Thus, scores from solved tertiary structures of NMR and crystallography-derived peptides of similar size and shape (PDB: 1Q3J, 1IVA, and 1DKC) were used to interpret the evaluation scores of our LhKNOT models. The top-ranked model was created using HHPred, a modeling program that uses the underlying model-building program, Modeller using a restraint-based comparative modeling approach. In addition, the KNOTTIN database’s KNOTER3D tool (; accessed on 15 May 2020) was used to evaluate the model’s tertiary structure, confirming LhKNOT’s adoption of the Knottin fold. All the identified homologs with no known structures were modeled using the top template identified in HHPred.",

To confirm the presence of the CPC clip in LhKNOT, docking analysis using the program, ClusPro 2.0 (which offers parameters specific to heparin as ligand; ; accessed on 2 March 2019), and subsequent analysis of predicted docking scenarios in the visualization program, PyMOL (; accessed on 10 March 2019) was performed. All potential docking scenarios were analyzed for identifying residues forming the putative CPC clip motif using the following steps. All polar interactions between LhKNOT and heparin were visualized in PyMOL and lists of participating residues were compiled. Predictions that contained the necessary Cation–Polar–Cation interactions were then further scrutinized for adherence to the CPC clip motif parameter by measuring distances between alpha carbons of participating residues as well as distances between center of mass of participating residues. PyMOL’s “Measurements” Wizard tool was used to measure distances between α-carbons of the participating residues. To evaluate the distances between centers of mass, a user-generated script available in the pymolwiki website (Henschel, ; accessed on 15 March 2019) was used to generate pseudo-atoms at the calculated sidechain center of mass. PyMOL’s APBS Electrostatics Plugin was used to render the surface electrostatics for the modeled LhKNOT. Similar steps were carried out to identify the CPC clip motif in each of the remaining knottin proteins in Supplementary Table S5.",

(B) Distances measured in PyMOL between the centers of mass of participating residues (grey pseudo-atoms) in the Drosomycin–heparin interaction. Distances fall within 2Å of the value ranges of the CPC clip motif. (C) Surface electrostatics of Drosomycin (fly; PDB: 1MYN), showing the positively charged binding surface formed by the CPC clip where heparin is docked. The surface electrostatic potentials are color-graded from −4 kT/e (red) to +4 kT/e (blue).",
