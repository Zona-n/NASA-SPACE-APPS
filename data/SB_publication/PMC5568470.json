            "text": "Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a human lung carcinogen and a human health concern. The induction of structural chromosome instability is considered to be a driving mechanism of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, due to its highly accurate repair of Cr(VI)-induced DNA double strand breaks. However, recent studies demonstrate Cr(VI) inhibits homologous recombination repair through the misregulation of RAD51. RAD51 is an essential protein in HR repair that facilitates the search for a homologous sequence. Recent studies show prolonged Cr(VI) exposure prevents proper RAD51 subcellular localization, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Since nuclear import of RAD51 is crucial to its function, this study investigated the effect of Cr(VI) on the RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. We show acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure induces the proper localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. In contrast, prolonged (120 h) exposure increased the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, although RAD51C localization was more severely impaired. These results correlate temporally with the previously reported Cr(VI)-induced RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. In addition, we found Cr(VI) does not inhibit interaction between RAD51 and its nuclear import mediators. Altogether, our results suggest prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent, BRCA2, which results in the cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Cr(VI)-induced inhibition of nuclear import may play a key role in its carcinogenic mechanism since the nuclear import of many tumor suppressor proteins and DNA repair proteins is crucial to their function.",

While HR repair is active after acute (24 h) Cr(VI) exposure, this repair pathway is inhibited by prolonged (120 h) exposure. Since HR repair is protective against Cr(VI)-induced chromosome damage, the inhibition of this repair pathway is an important component in the carcinogenetic mechanism of Cr(VI).

The irs3 cell line, derived from the parental V79 cells, expresses a mutated RAD51C gene resulting in undetectable levels of RAD51C protein. The RAD51C cDNA-complimented cell line, irs3#6 cells, express RAD51C protein levels comparable to the parental cell line, V79. Details and validation of these cells have been previously published.

It has previously been shown that Cr can bind to amino acids. Specifically, demonstrated in vitro that Cr can bind to arginine, one of the amino acids found at the NLS of both RAD51C and BRCA2. In fact, the classical NLS found in a multitude of proteins contains one or two short sequences of positively charged lysines and arginines. Thus, it is possible Cr directly binds to the NLS, blocking its recognition by importins. The binding of Cr to the NLS could also explain why RAD51C subcellular localization is more severely affected than that of BRCA2. RAD51C contains a single NLS, while BRCA2 contains three. Accordingly, if Cr inhibits nuclear import by interfering with the NLS, this effect would be more potent to RAD51C than BRCA2.",

However, RAD51 has been shown to directly interact with the sumoylation proteins, SUMO-1 and Ubc9, which are both involved in NPC-mediated nuclear transport (Shen et al., 1996). reported cytoplasmic localization of Ubc9 coincided with cytoplasmic localization of RAD51 and the inhibition of RAD51 foci formation in the presence of DNA double strand breaks.
