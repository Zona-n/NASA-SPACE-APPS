In the United States, more than 92% of children carry backpacks that weigh between 10 and 22% of their body weight. Of children between 11 and 14 years with low back pain, 82% attribute their pain to backpack use. One study correlates low back pain in adolescents with both the backpack weight and frequency of carrying a backpack.

The subjects were then re-imaged standing wearing the empty backpack. The subjects then repeated the standing measurements with the backpack loaded to 4 kg and 8 kg using ceramic tiles. These loads represented approximately 10% and 20% BW for our sample population. Subjects were unable to bear the 12 kg backpack load (30% BW) due to pain and discomfort.

For the posterior disc height, the distance from the most posterior-inferior corner of the upper vertebrae to the most posterior-superior corner of the lower vertebrae was measured. Disc height was obtained from the average of anterior and posterior disc heights according to the Dabbs’ method. Disc compression (mm) was defined as the difference in IVD height between the control supine condition and either standing, standing with a 4 kg backpack, or standing with an 8 kg backpack. Lumbar lordosis was defined as the Cobb angle between the superior endplates of the L1 and S1 vertebral bodies. Lumbar asymmetry was defined as the coronal Cobb angle between the superior endplates of L1 and S1. One independent observer (SS) measured the IVD heights and angles. Measurements were made with Osirix software, version 3.6.1 (University Hospital of Geneve, Switzerland), with a screen resolution of 1024×768 pixels.

Backpack load was positively associated with disc compression at L1-L2 by 0.042 ± 0.019 mm/kg (p = 0.042), at L4-L5 by 0.051 ± 0.023 mm/kg (p = 0.042), and at L5-S1 by 0.092 ± 0.018 mm/kg (p < 0.001). Additionally, the 4 kg backpack load significantly compressed the anterior L5-S1 disc height in relation to standing by 2.2 ± 0.3 mm (12.6 ± 4.7 %; p = 0.036) (Figure 3). Increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the disc height, anterior disc height, or posterior disc height for the other levels (Figure 2–3). The interaction between disc height and load was non-significant suggesting that each disc adapted to increasing loads similarly. One subject was excluded from the lumbar asymmetry analysis due to poor image quality. Increasing backpack loads did not affect lumbar asymmetry or lumbar lordosis (Figure 4–5). Subjects experienced increasing pain with backpack loads of 4 kg and 8 kg in reference to standing (Figure 6; p < 0.001). Pain positively correlated with backpack load (r = 0.668, p < 0.001). IVD degeneration analysis, using the Pfirmann system, graded a 3 for the L5-S1 IVDs of three subjects, while all other subjects IVDs received grades of 1 or 2. For each of the three subjects with Pfirmann grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not significantly compress the L5-S1 IVD height or anterior L5-S1 height. As backpack load increased, there was no difference in pain score or L5-S1 IVD height between subjects with Pfirmann grade 3 L5-S1 IVDs and those with grades 1 or 2.",

Additionally, the models estimated that ILBP children experience significantly less lumbar lordosis with 4 kg and 8 kg backpacks compared to normal children (Table 2). Pain with backpack loading was significantly worse in ILBP subjects while standing and at all loads in comparison to normal children (Table 2). The ILBP children could not tolerate the 12 kg backpack due to pain and further testing with that weight was abandoned after attempting to test seven subjects. We found no differences in lumbar asymmetry between the groups while standing or at any load (Table 2).",

The backpack load is assumed to be taken by the bone, IVDs, or muscles. In a pediatric population with a diagnosis of ILBP, the bone is assumed to be without pathology. The IVDs of our population were mostly healthy with Pfirmann grades of 1–2. For the three subjects with L5-S1 IVD grades of 3, increasing backpack load did not change the IVD height suggesting that the observed L5-S1 compression in ILBP children is not related to the measured IVD degeneration. Thus, children with ILBP, with healthy bone and IVDs, may alter the distribution of the backpack load from the IVDs to the surrounding paraspinal musculature through a “splinting” effect. Placing the backpack load on the musculature leads to muscle fatigue and subsequent pain.",

In adults, muscle fatigue leads to changes in muscle recruitment patterns, increases in spinal force, and an increase in spinal instability, which may all contribute to low back pain. Additionally, the cross-sectional area of the paraspinal muscles is smaller in adults with chronic low back pain in comparison to healthy individuals. Physical therapy (PT) aimed at paraspinal muscle strengthening in ILBP children may normalize the observed back pain with increasing backpack load and possibly redistribute the load to the IVDs.

We did not control the time of the day the subjects were tested or the subject’s level of activity the day of imaging. Most of the daily disc height loss while standing occurs during the first hour after rising from supine; our subjects had been standing for at least one hour prior to testing. However, the 30 minutes of lying supine prior to imaging provided some consistency to our measurements. Additionally, our pain scores were not specific to low back pain and may have encompassed neck, shoulder, and thoracic pain caused by the backpack. Because there is no established grading system for pediatric IVD health, we utilized the Pfirmann grading system for IVD degeneration due to its reliability even though it was designed for adults. The influence of these degenerative discs in the overall pain experience in each patient is unknown.
