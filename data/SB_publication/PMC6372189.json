Here we use systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approaches to identify most of the mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Sensitive sequence analysis techniques identified candidate Drosophila enzymes that share low global sequence identities with their human counterparts. Twenty Drosophila candidates were selected based upon (a) sequence identity with human enzymes of the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase branches, (b) similar domain architecture and structural conservation of the catalytic domain, and (c) presence of potentially equivalent functional residues. Evaluation of full-length structural models for these 20 top-scoring Drosophila candidates revealed a surprising degree of conservation in their overall folds and potential analogs for functional residues in all 20 enzymes. Although we were unable to identify any suitable candidate for lipoxygenase enzymes, we report structural homology models of three fly cyclooxygenases. Our findings predict that the D. melanogaster genome likely codes for one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis. Our study suggests that classical and/or novel eicosanoids mediators must regulate biological functions in insects–predictions that can be tested with the power of Drosophila genetics. Such experimental analysis of eicosanoid biology in a simple model organism will have high relevance to human development and health.",

            "text": "The eicosanoids are a family of biologically active lipids that have been implicated in various signaling pathways, with a central role in mammalian immunity and inflammation. The canonical eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway begins with the release of fatty acids, primarily arachidonic acid (AA), from membrane phospholipids when phospholipase A2 is activated. The canonical pathway then diverges, depending on whether the fatty acid substrate is processed by a cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), or a P450 epoxygenase (P450E). The COX enzymes generate prostanoids (prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes), resolvins, and electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) whereas the LOX enzymes produce the leukotrienes, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), and lipoxins. There is some cross-talk between the COX and LOX pathways, as both are known to produce hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs). The P450 epoxygenase pathway yields epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). These downstream products regulate diverse signaling pathways and biological processes ",

            "text": "The COX and LOX branches of the eicosanoid pathway are well-characterized in humans. The COX enzymes (prostaglandin G/H synthases) are encoded by COX-1 (PTGS1) and COX-2 (PTGS2). COX-1 is constitutively expressed at low levels by most cells. In contrast, COX-2 is upregulated at sites of inflammation and during tumor progression. COX-1 and COX-2 are membrane-associated heme-containing homodimers that catalyze the conversion of an 18–22 carbon polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA, typically AA, an ω-6, 20-carbon fatty acid) into prostaglandins G2 and H2. Although AA is the preferred substrate, the COX enzymes are known to oxygenate eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 n-3), linoleic acid (LA, 18:2 n-6), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DHLA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), with varying efficiencies. This initial substrate choice is significant, as it determines whether the downstream prostanoid will tend to be pro- or anti-inflammatory. Fatty acids with two double bonds (e.g., AA) are converted into series-2 prostanoids (e.g., PGH2, PGE2), which are associated with pro-inflammatory signaling. In contrast, fatty acid substrates with three or four double bonds (e.g., EPA, DHLA, respectively) yield series-1 and 3 prostanoids (PGH1, PGE3), which are associated with anti-inflammatory signaling. Some COX products, such as the anti-inflammatory resolvins are synthesized only from EPA and DHA, whereas the pro- and anti-inflammatory 9- and 13-HODEs are generated from LA by COX enzymes. Nevertheless, AA is the primary substrate for COX enzymes and so COX signaling tends to be pro-inflammatory. As a result, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit COX-1/2’s ability to generate pro-inflammatory products, are particularly important. PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of downstream eicosanoids, including PGD2, PGE2, PGF1α PGF2α, PGI2 (prostacyclin), and the thromboxanes TXA2 and TXB2. The downstream processing route depends on the availability of enzymes in a given cell type. For example, endothelial cells primarily produce PGI2, whereas platelets mainly produce TXA2.",

            "text": "The LOX pathway operates independently from the COX pathway, diverging at the initial fatty acid processing stage. In humans, LOX enzymes are encoded by several genes (ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15). Mammalian LOX enzymes catalyze the stereospecific dehydrogenation and dioxygenation of a PUFA, such as AA or LA, leading to the formation of a hydroxyperoxide containing a 1-hydroxyperoxy-2-trans-4-cis-pentadiene fragment. The mammalian LOXs have been named according to the position of the carbon at which the oxygen molecule is inserted into AA, the primary fatty acid substrate, e.g., as 5-, 12-, or 15-LOX). The primary products are 5S-, 12S-, or 15S-HPETE, which can be further reduced by glutathione peroxidase to hydroxy forms (5-, 12-, 15-HETE), respectively. 5-LOX is the only LOX that produces leukotrienes, and it is notable that catalytic activity requires the presence of a second protein (ALOX5AP), though the precise function of Five-Lipoxygenase Activating Protein (FLAP) is not known. Following conversion of a fatty acid into 5-HPETE, downstream processing results in the terminal leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4. The leukotrienes are clinically significant, as they are implicated in the allergic response and maintenance of chronic inflammation. 15-LOX (and to a lesser extent 5-LOX) produce the lipoxins LXA and LXB.",

            "text": "The COX family enzymes are highly conserved across the animal kingdom, with orthologs found in the primitive marine corals as well as the higher vertebrates. Traditional genomic analyses have failed to identify COX orthologs in the known genomes of insects, unicellular organisms, or plants, although prostaglandins, their primary products, have been found in some of these organisms. Recent studies have suggested that an insect cyclooxygenase may exist in orthologs of the Drosophila gene Pxt. LOX enzymes display an even broader degree of conservation, with orthologs found across the animal kingdom and in a variety of plants. Sequence and biochemical analyses have failed to identify any insect LOX orthologs, with the exception of LOX activity in the primitive insect, Thermobia domestica and one report in D. melanogaster. Thus, there is conflicting information regarding the existence of functional COX or LOX pathway in insects. Given the complexity and biomedical importance of eicosanoid biology, defining the COX and LOX pathways in a model organism is a research priority. Identification of a functionally conserved COX or LOX pathway in D. melanogaster opens up exciting research avenues for understanding the genetic basis of eicosanoid-mediated inflammation in this well-established and simple model organism.",

While an initial BLAST search revealed candidates for the most conserved enzymes, it failed to identify likely orthologs for some of these enzymes. A more rigorous approach using iterative sequence searches combined with structural modeling revealed a surprising degree of similarity between mammalian and fly enzymes and the apparent conservation of functionally important residues even in these most distant candidate enzymes. Although we could not identify any suitable candidates for lipoxygenase enzymes, other component enzymes of the LOX branch of the pathway were identified. This suggests the possibility that eicosanoid pathway may adopt a non-canonical form in D. melanogaster and insects in general. Our study challenges the current view that insects lack a functional eicosanoid pathway and opens up tremendous possibilities of utilizing a well-established model organism for eicosanoid research.",

For this, each human enzyme reference sequence was queried against a subset of the D. melanogaster NCBI non-redundant sequence database. DELTA-BLAST is a more sensitive variant of the traditional BLAST algorithm that incorporates domain information from pre-constructed position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) in order to improve detection of homology. JACKHMMER is an alternative sequence analysis and alignment tool that operates in an iterative fashion by generating a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) for a query protein, searching the target sequence database, and then updating the HMM to include sequences that score above a given cut-off value. For this study, specialized BLAST and HMMer algorithms were leveraged as part of a combined approach to identify candidates which may be remote homologs for the human eicosanoid synthesis enzymes.",

MODELLER, a homology modeling tool, predicts the tertiary structure of a protein based on satisfaction of spatial restraints derived from sequentially similar templates whose structure is known (i.e., a sequence-sequence comparison). In contrast, I-TASSER utilizes a multi-threading algorithm (i.e., a sequence-structure comparison) to identify suitable templates followed by an iterative template fragment assembly approach based on replica-exchange Monte Carlo simulations to generate the full length model; unaligned primary sequence regions are built using ab initio methods. LOMETS is a meta-server that generates and ranks modeling results produced using several alternative threading algorithms which are executed in parallel. The accuracy of homology modeling depends largely on the target-template alignment, with ≥40% sequence identity generally yielding high quality models and 25% sequence identity being the lower threshold for an acceptable model. However, threading based modeling tools are generally less sensitive to sequence identity differences and some packages (e.g., I-TASSER) are known to generate high quality models using templates sharing as little as 20–30% sequence identity with the target sequence.",

If a suitable single full-length template was not found, either due to a lack of coverage or low sequence identity within the aligned range, I-TASSER was used to generate a composite model based on several templates. In each case, the initial model was used to generate a refined full atomic model using ModRefiner, which also optimizes sidechain placement. All of the refined models were then evaluated using the ProSa, ProQ2 and MODFOLD4 servers. Loops and unstructured N- and C-terminal regions in these models were optimized using ab initio methods (e.g., MODELLER’s loop routines or QUARK), refined using ModRefiner and reevaluated as necessary. Unsuitable models were rejected and rebuilt using alternatives templates according to the preceding protocol.

However, using a more sensitive approach based on iterative HMMER searches, we uncovered potential D. melanogaster candidates that may function as eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. A majority of these candidates were shown to adopt a highly similar tertiary structure with the human target enzymes. Template based modeling approaches produce models that are structurally similar to the templates used, so the modeled enzymes were validated using evaluation techniques that confirm that the primary sequence is compatible with its modeled three dimensional structure. To rule out potential false positives, the structure was evaluated carefully for conservation of the necessary catalytic residues in a structural context as well.

This gene has also been identified in a bioinformatics screen for MAPEG family member. This protein displays 36% identity and 54% similarity to the sequence of human prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES, NP_004869.1). The human PTGES (PS-1) is an integral membrane protein that operates as a homotrimer and is known to catalyze the oxidoreduction of prostaglandin endoperoxide H2 (PGH2) to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PTGES is characterized by the presence of a single MAPEG domain, which spans the region 16–146. PTGES (e.g., PDB ID: 4AL0) and is characteristic of several proteins belonging to the MAPEG family which includes MSGT and PTGES proteins. This sequence is annotated as “MSGT-like” but the predicted structure of CG1742 is nearly identical and displays an RMSD 1.15 Å over 152 residues when superimposed with PTGES. PTGES, earlier referred to as MGST1-L1 is a glutathione-binding protein, and residues R38, R70, E77, R110, Y117, R126, and Y130 of human PTGES are associated with enzymatic activity as well as binding to glutathione. Structural superposition reveals that CG1742 has a fully conserved set of these key functional residues, (R40, R71, E78, R111, Y118, R128, and F132). With respect to the last residue, a tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution is likely to be functionally equivalent as phenylalanine and tyrosine have side chains with a single aromatic ring of similar volume. Phenylalanine differs only in that it lacks the hydroxyl group in the ortho position on the benzene ring. Since previous studies suggest that the aromatic ring of Y130 is likely important for PGH2-binding, an analog for this structural element is provided by F132. Details of modeled fly candidate PTGES and its comparison with human PTGES are provided in S1 Fig and a similar format is followed for all the candidate orthologs identified.",

HPGD catalyzes the conversion of the 15-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins into a keto group, which strongly reduces the biologic activity of these molecules. As a result, HPGD is considered the primary enzyme responsible for degradation of prostaglandins. It has been reported that N91, S138, Q148 and Y151 are required for catalysis. CG18814 residues N89, S137 and Y150 of CG18814 align with these catalytic residues and are oriented at overlapping or directly adjacent positions in close proximity in the structural alignment of the CG18814 model against the structure of HPGD. CG18814 lacks an obvious analog for Q148, which is located in a flexible loop region. However, CG18814 possesses a structurally-aligned loop region which contains Q142. Q148 and Q142 are located within approximately 5Å of each other and oriented similarly in a static superposition of the predicted model and crystal structure and may be functionally analogous. Moreover, both proteins have an identical domain architecture, with a short-chain dehydrogenase domain (Pfam ID: PF00106) spanning from the N-terminus to approximately residue 180.

TBXAS1 localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to thromboxane A2 (TBA2). TBXAS1 is categorized as a cytochrome p450 family (CYP450) enzyme based on sequence similarity. This categorization is illustrated by the fact that the only domain identified in TBXAS1 is a Cytochrome P450 domain (Pfam ID: PF00067) spanning most of the protein. CYP450 enzymes are highly conserved in eukaryotes, where they catalyze reactions in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. However, this ubiquitous nature of CYP450 enzymes makes it difficult to identify potential orthologs for any one specific enzyme within the family. CG3616 was selected as a candidate from the set of eight fly candidates with similar sequences after taking into account the initial sequence comparison, the transmembrane helix pattern (calculated using TOPCONS), and the alignment score against a multiple sequence alignment of known or high confidence TBXAS1 orthologs. A structural superposition of a modeled human TBXAS1 (no structure available) with the predicted model of CG3616 showed an RMSD of 0.699 Å over 518 residues (S13 Fig).",

However, there have been sporadic reports of prostaglandin detected in D. melanogaster extracts over the years. The human genome encodes three major cyclooxygenase isozymes via two loci. PTGS1 encodes COX-1 (a constitutive cyclooxygenase), whereas PTGS2 encodes COX-2 (which is inducible and expressed in a tissue-specific manner). A truncated and poorly characterized isoform of PTGS1, COX-3 is also expressed in certain cells, and reportedly demonstrates reduced prostaglandin synthesis activity relative to COX-1. COX-1 and COX-2 operate as homodimers and are characterized by two domains: An N-terminal EGF-like domain (Pfam ID: IPR000742) and an animal heme peroxidase domain (Pfam ID: PF03098). The former allows for association with the cell and nuclear membrane while the latter is responsible for the cyclooxygenase activity. The COX enzymes initiate the prostaglandin synthesis pathway by converting arachidonic acid, or other polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) substrates, into the unstable intermediate PGG2 followed by PGH2. During this process, it has been reported that a small amount of the PUFA substrate is converted into a racemic mixture of 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acids (i.e., 15-HETEs), which may be processed into lipoxins, a poorly understood class of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids. The COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes contain two active sites: a heme with peroxidase activity, responsible for the reduction of PGG2 to PGH2, and a cyclooxygenase site, where arachidonic acid is converted into the hydroperoxy endoperoxide prostaglandin G2 (PGG2). Extensive studies have been performed on the sheep ortholog of COX-1(NP_001009476.1; PDB ID: 1CQE), which is a proxy for the human orthologs. These studies reveal that cyclooxygenase activity is mediated by Y385, which forms a radical capable of abstracting a hydrogen from the PUFA substrate (e.g., carbon-13 of arachidonic acid). H207 and H388 are also required for the dual peroxidase and cyclooxygenase functions of these enzymes. Other functional residues identified in the literature include R120, Q203, V349, and S530. R120 interacts with C-1 of the PUFA substrate, arachidonic acid. Q203 is conserved among mammalian COX enzymes, though the function of this residue is currently unknown. V349 is believed to play a role in substrate specificity; mammalian COX enzymes share this residue and show a substrate preference for arachidonic acid, while invertebrate COX enzymes that have a leucine at this position display specificity for linoleic acid and S530 acetylation is the basis for COX-2 inhibition by aspirin.",

Following this filtering step, only three proteins remained as viable candidates for further study: CG4009, CG6969, and CG7660. CG7660 has been shown to demonstrate COX-like activity that plays an important role in Drosophila reproduction. All three candidates appear to have the requisite catalytic triad and share a similar domain architecture, though they each lack the N-terminal EGF-like domain. Putative analogs for the H206, Y384 and H387 catalytic triad appear to be present on CG4009 at H163, Y399, H401 and on CG7660 at H222, Y564, H568, respectively.",

These candidates may have thus far eluded detection because of high sequence divergence compared to the mammalian enzymes. However, the modeling results from our study, suggest that these candidates share the same overall fold and matches for the known or predicted catalytic residues. The prediction of eicosanoid synthesis enzymes may explain the in vivo effects of aspirin and prostaglandins in oogenesis and possibly the existence of eicosanoid-like compounds in D. melanogaster. Our results however raise many questions: (a) What are the exact roles of individual enzymes; do they catalyze the reactions their structures predict they should? (b) What are the intermediate and final end products of the pathway? (c) What are the principal physiological events these intermediate and final biosynthetic products control and how similar are the signaling mechanisms by which their effects are mediated in cells and tissues?",

Dual function cyclooxygenases can generate prostaglandins and lipoxygenase products (e.g. HPETEs). For example, mammalian cyclooxygenases can produce limited amounts of 11- and 15-HPETE as a by-product in addition to PGH and aspirin-acetylated COX-2 has been shown to produce 15R-HETEs. Similar activity by one of the putative D. melanogaster COX orthologs could provide upstream processing needed for 11- and 15-HPETE, though this fails to provide the 5-HPETE intermediate needed for downstream leukotriene synthesis. Alternatively, 5-HETEs may be produced using an unconventional mechanism by the COX candidates or perhaps by an unidentified enzyme.",

The mammalian eicosanoids are primarily derived from 20-carbon PUFAs (arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid), as well as from 18-carbon PUFAs (γ-linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid and linoleic acid). In the vertebrate pathway, the 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid can be processed into the 20-carbon PUFAs arachidonic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, respectively, via a three-step process involving a Δ6 desaturase, an elongase, and, a Δ5 desaturase. These 20-carbon PUFAs are then capable of being processed by COX or LOX to generate the canonical eicosanoids. 18-carbon PUFAs (e.g., linoleic acid) may also be processed by 15-LOX into 9- and 13-HODEs, a subfamily of non-canonical eicosanoids.",

Furthermore, flies raised in the absence of 20-carbon PUFAs for several generations remain healthy, implying that 20-carbon PUFAs are non-essential. Thus, it is generally accepted that Drosophila rely on PUFAs obtained from its vegetarian diet, which is generally limited to the essential 18-carbon fatty acids linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (18:3n-3). Based on the current understanding that D. melanogaster lacks Δ5 and Δ6 desaturase activity, it would be expected that the 18-carbon PUFAs obtained from its diet are processed into HODEs as opposed to eicosanoid derivatives of the 20-carbon PUFAs. Recent studies have validated this hypothesis, and confirmed the presence of 9- and 13-HODEs in D. melanogaster extracts (Govind lab, unpublished work). However, given the reports of prostaglandin-like molecules in D. melanogaster extracts, it is probable that additional lipid processing occurs to produce compounds similar to the canonical eicosanoids but the biosynthetic components have not been identified yet. Further computational and experimental work is needed to fully resolve these issues.",
