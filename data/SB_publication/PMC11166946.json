These alterations encompass genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased inflammation, homeostatic dysregulation, and various epigenomic changes. Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome, a clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA’s GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of a frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of a frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.",

Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts’ safety. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer risk. Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mechanisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative stress (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among others. As a defined set of aging-related molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce a condition similar to premature or pathological aging.",

It leads to a systemic loss of the body’s capacity to maintain homeostasis and health. The aging phenotype manifests in metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological deterioration, and cancer. Old age is also marked by immune dysregulation, which can result in a chronic low-grade inflammation state called inflammaging, a status associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in blood and tissues. The deterioration in muscle quality and quantity is another feature of aging, characterized by altered myofiber metabolism and impaired satellite cell activity. Loss of muscle mass increases the risk of developing other comorbidities, in a vicious cycle that leads to unhealthy aging. These traits are often associated with a multifactorial geriatric syndrome known as “frailty”.",

These alterations lead to a depletion of physiological reserve and/or deterioration of cognitive functions, resulting in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Frailty can be clinically diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following components: unintentional weight loss over the last year, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity level. Other criteria for diagnosing and assessing frailty are functional factors such as grip strength and gait speed. More holistic definitions of frailty also consider the presence of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, psychosocial risk factors and other common geriatric syndromes. The use of clinical scores to quantify frailty has been attempted, but it is undermined by encountered limitations in terms of ethnicity, risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, advancements in the understanding of the biological processes related to frailty and aging, along with the development of high-throughput techniques, allowed the development of novel assessment models based on “omics” biomarkers.",

Yet, despite the reported similarities between the features of frailty and consequence of spaceflight, it remains unclear whether the space environment can influence the onset of age-related dysfunctions in astronauts. Getting insights about the signatures of frailty and sarcopenia in spaceflight data is a key step towards the development of countermeasures to achieve safer crewed space missions and translate therapy to patients on Earth. Here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts, murine and cellular models. We investigate this occurrence using multi-omics and systems-informatic approaches. We analyzed transcriptomic data from rodent research missions flown to the International Space Station (ISS) (available from NASA’s Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), previously known as GeneLab), astronaut data from a recent JAXA study, and data from the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (i4). We identified altered expression in genes related to frailty and muscle loss, that may lead to an early frailty phenotype. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflammation, muscle wasting and other age-related features. Our findings propose a method to study the development of frailty-related health risks, which astronauts may develop during spaceflight, in the perspective of achieving adequate preventative measures.",

In mice, altered expression of frailty-related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius (34 genes in OSD-21 and 8 genes in OSD-101); extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (45 genes in OSD-99); quadriceps (26 genes in OSD-101); soleus (36 genes in OSD-104); tibialis anterior (32 genes in OSD-105) (Fig. 2A). A maximum number of four frailty-related genes was also found to be unique to each tissue type and a maximum number of 4 was common between the different datasets (Supplementary Data 2). Hierarchical clustering of the overlapping gene expression across muscle types revealed a bias towards the up-regulation of frailty-related genes (Fig. 2B). As an example, the extensor digitorum longus had several upregulated genes (EGLN3, PTGS2, VDR, FREM2, KRT18, BCL2L1, LGALS3, CXCL10, CX3CL1, FNDC5, TGFB1, CAN, and PPARGC1A).

Rodent datasets showed a general enrichment of the pathways with an overall upregulation in EDL and tibialis anterior, downregulation in quadriceps, and a mixed regulation in gastrocnemius soleus (Fig. 3A,B). Summary themes of each functional cluster are displayed by the external color panel at the right side of sub-figure B and C. Despite a mixed direction of regulation, a clear enrichment of these pathways in the spaceflight group when compared to the control was evident across the datasets. The soleus muscle revealed an increase in the innate immune response inflammatory signature and concomitant downregulation of the IGF-1 pathway (Fig. 3B). Previous literature showed that the soleus muscle is the first to be impacted by spaceflight and also known to experience a significant dysregulation of mitochondrial and immune functions in space. Immune response can downregulate IGF-1 anabolic activity, promoting muscle wasting. Of note, this muscle shows the largest decline in mass in the RR1 mission and IGF-1 pathway might be involved. Several putative aging-related pathways were enriched in human datasets (Fig. 3C), showing up-regulation in the majority of cases.

Next, via co-expression network analysis upon these DEGs, the most highly correlated module (i.e., BROWN = 0.93) to sarcopenia was found.

First, using astronaut data from JAXA plasma cell-free RNA profiling study, we examined the changes occurring in RNAs from the frailty biomarker genes between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight (i.e., after return to Earth) (Fig. 6). Our RNA analysis reveals a global response of frailty-related gene expression to the space environment, which is characterized by in-flight and post-flight expression changes. Most of the genes investigated were subject to changes when compared to pre-flight conditions, either during spaceflight or later after return to Earth. A large number of genes that were reduced during spaceflight showed an increase after re-entry (e.g., AKT1, NOS2, FGF23, and HIF3A). Conversely, several genes show an opposite behavior and tended to be reduced during spaceflight, and underwent reduction after re-entry (e.g., TGFB1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2, SOD3, and OAZ1).",

The data suggest that space conditions alter the HIF1 pathway which stimulates the various molecular or cellular processes related to hypoxia-responsive genes such as HIF1A, HIF1AN, ARNT, ARNT2, NOS1, NOS2, NOTCH1 and RBX1, that are known to regulate a wide variety of cellular physiology including metabolic reprogramming, anti-apoptosis, migration, proliferation, amyloid β production and prion stabilization. An interesting observation emerging from the data is the increased cell-free RNA signature of HIF1A and HIF3A post-flight. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) is a key regulator of immune cell function, and its dysregulation could alter immune response. We also observe an increase of RNAs derived from several nitric oxide (NO) related genes, which are biologic mediators in multiple processes, such as in neurotransmission and microbial and antitumoral activities. It is understood that nitric oxide (NO) is a key vasodilator in the cardiovascular system and its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme family nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (NOS1), inducible (NOS2) and endothelial synthases (NOS3). NOS1 and NOS2 are constitutively expressed by tubules of the human kidney, while NOS3 is expressed by endothelial cells and is implicated with the formation and maintenance of vascularized tissues. Furthermore, AKT1 plays a role in the signal transduction of growth factors, as well as in cell survival, cellular senescence, and aging. There is evidence that AKT signaling is associated with an imbalance of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases that is altering the aged brain. Chronic AKT activation intensified aging-induced cardiac hypertrophy in murine heart tissues. In connection to phosphate intake, FGF23 is known to be secreted from the skeletal system and influence the kidneys through the klotho gene receptor36. The upregulation of HIF-related genes could be interpreted through findings from earlier studies which have implicated the HIF pathway with the impairment of energy-dependent cellular processes, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA which accelerate aging processes.",

These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like processes in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract them. In our manuscript, we include data from NASA’s OSDR, the SpaceX Inspiration4 and the JAXA astronaut study.

Because of these similarities, observations from the aging field can be useful to understand the biological changes driven by spaceflight. In contrast with aging on Earth, it is unclear whether those molecular modifications last after reentry, and for this reason we refer to them as aging-like phenomena. Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut’s return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in a chronic exposure scenario, like a long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development.",

Here, we examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. Our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging-related pathways to a different extent depending on the tissue. Importantly, we also found changes in expression of putative frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during spaceflight much as they are being examined for utility in clinical assessment of physiological changes with age on Earth.

Although their expression could revert to normal after a longer period, this altered expression could hint to the presence of spaceflight-induced modifications that persist for longer than expected. For example, AKT1 is upregulated at all timepoints after reentry. A persisted upregulation of the gene is linked to age related cardiac disease and dementia in animal models. The presence of biomarker gene expression that does not revert to normal challenges the concept that every physiological change induced by spaceflight is reverted after astronauts’ return to Earth. This notion is not novel, for example, a recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in astronauts; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Permanent modifications after exposure to important stressors happen in patients as well.

While there is an emerging blood panel for assessment of frailty, these would need to be processed on Earth. By contrast, the assessment of a future clinically validated transcriptomic panel for frailty could be conducted on ISS or other spacecrafts. Regardless of which panel or where such a panel is assessed, our findings suggest that future studies aimed at establishing such a validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in- and post-flight.

Low grade inflammation contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis on Earth. In addition, radiation exposure can also lead to the development of cardiovascular disease in case of occupational exposure, as well as in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. In astronauts, atherosclerosis could be promoted by an increased inflammatory status promoted by different stressors of the space environment (Fig. 1), and radiation exposure would play a primary role for it. Moon and Mars missions have a different radiation environment compared with the ISS, as astronauts traveling beyond Low Earth Orbit are potentially exposed to higher doses of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle event radiation. Elevated radiation exposure promotes multiple dysregulations, causing cellular senescence in the endothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, driving endothelial dysfunction. Exposure to higher doses of space radiation beyond low Earth orbit could also have a different, and perhaps increased, impact on frailty-related hallmarks and genes. Concerning endothelial dysfunction, an interplay between nitric oxide metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species and radiation exposure could play a role in the development of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways, in space. Moreover, a pro-inflammatory and oxidative environment might facilitate the development of the spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS); this condition would also increase the disability status of the crew.",

            "text": "Across species, altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. Unsurprisingly, these changes vary from organism to organism among microbes and tissue to tissue in animals (Fig. 8). A recent rodent transcriptomic study confirmed that the typical mammalian coordination of metabolism between the liver and muscles on Earth continues to function similarly in flight. This metabolic axis is a key determinator of health with age, whose disruption is associated with obesity, diabetes, and frailty. Emerging techniques such as metabolomics are beginning to address the role and mechanisms of metabolic alteration in human muscle with age. Here we have employed another emerging analytical approach, metabolic flux modeling from transcriptomic data (Fig. 8). Our results confirm that metabolic flux analysis successfully demonstrated metabolic alterations as expected, dependent on tissue type. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and organisms, they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches. The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome c oxidase enzymatic activity. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these differences. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts and/or in combination with model systems.",

            "text": "Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with age. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes metabolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic—also highlighting the importance of temporal/dynamic data. Similarly, in humans subjected to bedrest, an analogue for spaceflight, changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolic activity are an early event tied to altered intramuscular calcium levels. The recent study of muscle-liver metabolic cross talk in mice used the same mouse muscle datasets we used for this manuscript (Fig. 8) and found altered glucose and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight, consistent with past literature on space flown mammalian muscle. Combining this past analysis with our new analysis of sarcopenic gene expression changes, it is noteworthy that few sarcopenic gene expression changes are noted in the space flown muscles with more observed changes in the soleus, which was the muscle displaying the largest decline in mass. Together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic changes may indeed precede the loss of muscle mass in spaceflight, as observed with age and bedrest on Earth. It remains an open question if, like sarcopenia, metabolic alterations occur earlier than the inflammatory alterations in flight and whether inflammation or an altered metabolism is the key driver for a frailty-like phenotype in space. Lastly, given the similarities between transcriptomic changes with age and spaceflight, the facts that estrogen receptor has recently been proposed to be a key regulator of muscle gene expression changes with age and that estrogen receptor pathways have recently been shown to display differences in flight, raise the possibility that estrogen receptor pathways are key modulators of muscle health in space. The restriction of available sources poses a frequent challenge in the field of space medical and biological research. In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted a diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when extending conclusions from one model system to another or from cellular and tissue-level observations to the overall phenotypes of organisms. Nonetheless, a noteworthy aspect of our findings is the utilization of a weight-of-evidence approach, wherein data across multiple models are analyzed. This method reveals conserved pathways that consistently emerge in independent datasets, likely indicating fundamental biological responses akin to frailty in the context of spaceflight. Pursuing the development of biobanks for multi-omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research. Yet, concurrently, bridging the gap between molecular changes, pathophysiological processes and phenotype development requires multi-omics biological data to be associated with individual physical metrics. This is crucial to investigate complex syndromes such as frailty. Future studies will be conducted to observe global and systemic impact on how the frailty index will change during spaceflight.",

Changes in genomic and genetic material that are deemed to potentially associate with frailty include genome instability, epigenetic alterations, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin structure. Cellular processes that are of interest to frailty pathways include: (1) processes that are key to maintaining the cell cycle—cell senescence, stem-cell generation, and the pathways that involve p53, the protein tumor suppressor; (2) mechanisms involved in proteostasis (protein regulation); (3) mitochondrial processes involving dysfunction and disease; and (4) intercellular processes that involve inflammation and intercellular communication. The actions of the protein complexes—proteasome, lysosome, and chaperone—are considered in the network of pathways that regulate proteins.

Subsequently, to generate the Venn diagram, R language v4.1.0 was used, through the library ggplot2 v3.4.0. It was extracted from the table of frailty genes (Table 2), with genes unique to mice and humans, and with genes common for both (the intersections). After generating the diagram, a list of genes was extracted and manually added to the diagram. To generate the two upset plot graphs (for mice genes and human genes), the R language was also used, using the library ggplot2 v3.4.0 and ComplexUpset v1.3.5. Finally, to generate the heatmap, the python 3 v3.10.0 language was used, through the Seaborn v0.12.1 and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries. Two heatmaps were generated (one for the mice genes and the other for the human genes), relating the genes to the respective OSD datasets.

Four civilians, two males and two females, spent three days in low-Earth orbit (LEO) at 585 km above Earth. The mission launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on September 15th, 2021, and splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean near Cape Canaveral on September 18th, 2021. Several human related experiments were carried out to study the effects of spaceflight on human health and performance in collaboration with SpaceX, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), and Weill Cornell Medicine. The experiments conducted on the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and experimental protocols were approved at the principal investigators’ institutions at Weill Cornell Medicine. All I4 crew members have given informed consent to participate in these studies. The i4 crews’ physiological changes were monitored with ultrasound scanning, molecular diagnostics devices, smartwatch wearables devices, and etc.. Infection or inflammation are the most prevalent clinical symptoms found during the long-term (around 6 months) spaceflight. However, there were no clinical reports of infection or inflammation. Although two astronauts presented with space motion sickness, most metrics (e.g., internal jugular vein size, heart rate, complete blood count, gene expression, and cytokines) were either stable, or quickly reverted back to baseline after landing. The experiments conducted by the Inspiration4 crew members were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines at the principal investigators’ institutions. Moreover, the different study designs and the corresponding methods to collect and analyze the biological samples were approved by the corresponding institutional IRB. All biological data derived from the Inspiration4 mission were collected pre and post flights. For this study, only data from blood samples were used. Pre-flight samples were collected at L-92, L-44, and L-3 days prior to launch to space. Upon return, post-flight samples were collected at R + 1, R + 45, and R + 82 days.",

Here, we used GOstat 2022-11-03 on R version 4.2 to find enriched Biological Process and Molecular Function terms (Fig A and C). Using the obtained GO terms we found that some of the Frailty linked genes from JAXA CFE were also part of some of the same processes (Fig B and D). The figure was created using the GOplot package 1.0.2 and modified to display the MAS for each gene. Finally, to determine the relevance of the shared 21 genes between all gene lists (Fig E), we assessed their expression in the mice datasets OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, and OSD-105.

This updated simulation model was constructed based on the RECON3D metabolic model whose metabolic reactions were subsetted through CORDA and Cobrapy with gene-reaction-rule, where enzyme expression levels are linked to their corresponding metabolic reactions. For CORDA, flux confidence parameters ranging from 3 to 1 were decided as; (i) 55%, 25%, and 20% for OSD-91; (ii) 45%, 40%, and 15% for OSD-127, in order to minimize standard deviation of flux-levels across samples from each group for all groups. Also, several essential pathways such as ‘Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis’, ‘CoA Synthesis’, ‘CoA Catabolism’, ‘NAD Metabolism’, ‘Fatty Acid Synthesis’, ‘Fatty Acid Oxidation’, and ‘Biomass and Maintenance Functions’ were manually activated for the simulation model stability. Note that ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation’ and ‘Citric Acid Cycle’ were not included in the essential pathways to take into account mitochondrial dysregulation. Our metabolic model initially optimized for NAD biosynthesis whose capacity through all pathways of human was computed by estimating optimized ‘NAD sink’ reaction flux level where the sink was defined as large pools of metabolites importing metabolites from/to the system. Subsequently, optimization for all available reactions was conducted iteratively to compute flux levels of their corresponding reactions by Gurobi solver as LP whose reference manual can be found in https://www.gurobi.com. While gene expression levels were applied into the model by each sample, the other parameters were maintained identically for all simulation, where an environment i.e., Jupyter notebook 6.1.5 on Python 3.7.7 was utilized. The simulation reported outcomes as flux levels of all available reactions through the custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) analyses and the levels were analyzed as grouped variables for comparison between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’ groups. Since it is hard to presume variance or normality between ‘Flight’ and ‘Ground’, a non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test was applied to properly compare their flux levels using the R matrixTests package (v. 0.1.9). The comparison is illustrated as heatmaps with row-wise Z-scores on flux levels per each reaction in Fig. 8. Tabular data of metabolic flux analysis is shown in supplement 6.",
