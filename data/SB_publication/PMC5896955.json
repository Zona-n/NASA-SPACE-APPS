While recent studies have identified distinct populations of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) that are required for mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception remain unknown. Here, we show that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) are critical regulators of acute mechanonociception. Genetic or pharmacological ablation of S1PR3, or blockade of S1P production, significantly impaired the behavioral response to noxious mechanical stimuli, with no effect on responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by fast-conducting A mechanonociceptors, which displayed a significant decrease in mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. We show that S1PR3 signaling tunes mechanonociceptor excitability via modulation of KCNQ2/3 channels. Our findings define a new role for S1PR3 in regulating neuronal excitability and establish the importance of S1P/S1PR3 signaling in the setting of mechanical pain thresholds.",

Distinct cells and molecules detect noxious thermal and mechanical stimuli. Thermal pain is detected by thermosensitive TRP channels in subsets of nociceptors, and gentle touch is detected by Piezo2 channels in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs).

The Npy2r+ subpopulation of HTMRs mediates fast paw withdrawal responses to pinprick stimulation and terminates as free nerve endings in the epidermis. The Calca+ subpopulation of circumferential-HTMRs responds to noxious force and hair pulling, and terminates as circumferential endings wrapped around guard hair follicles. Additionally, somatostatin-expressing interneurons of laminae I-III in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receive input from nociceptors and are required for behavioral responses to painful mechanical stimuli. Despite these advances in defining the cells and circuits of mechanical pain, little is known about the molecular signaling pathways in mechanonociceptors.",

S1P is a bioactive lipid that signals via 5 G-protein coupled S1P Receptors (S1PRs 1–5). S1P signaling, mainly via S1PR1, plays a well-known role in immune cell migration and maturation. Additionally, recent studies have shown that S1PRs are expressed throughout the nervous system and S1P signaling is associated with a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease. S1P has been implicated in spontaneous pain and thermal pain hypersensitivity, but due to conflicting accounts of S1P receptor expression in the CNS and PNS as well as inconsistent reports on the effects of S1P on neuronal excitability and pain behaviors, the role of S1P in somatosensation remains controversial.",

Likewise, peripheral blockade of S1PR3 signaling or S1P production impairs mechanical sensitivity. We show that S1P constitutively enhances the excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via closure of KCNQ2/3 potassium channels to tune mechanical pain sensitivity. The effects of S1P are completely dependent on S1PR3. While previous studies have shown that elevated S1P triggers acute pain and injury-evoked thermal sensitization, we now demonstrate that baseline levels of S1P are necessary and sufficient for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, elevated S1P selectively triggers thermal sensitization via activation of TRPV1+ heat nociceptors, with no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity. Our findings uncover an essential role for constitutive S1P signaling in mechanical pain.",

Immunostaining revealed the tactile organ is preferentially innervated by myelinated Aδ fibers, which are primarily mechanosensitive. While our original analysis focused on ion channels enriched in the neurons of the star organ, our dataset also revealed enrichment of several components of the S1P pathway, including S1pr3. Likewise, single-cell RNA seq of mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed S1pr3 expression in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors in addition to a subpopulation of peptidergic C nociceptors.",

Moreover, S1PR3 KO mice demonstrated decreased responses to a range of noxious tactile stimuli (2–6 g; Figure 1B) and to noxious pinprick stimulation (Figure 1C), but normal responsiveness to innocuous tactile stimuli (0.6–1.4 g; Figure 1B). S1PR3 KO mice exhibited normal tape removal attempts (Figure 1D), righting reflexes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), radiant heat withdrawal latencies (Figure 1E), and itch-evoked scratching (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).

To further test this model, we asked if the mechanical hyposensitivity elicited after endogenous S1P depletion (via SKI II) could be rescued by local injection of exogenous S1P. Indeed, we found that injection of exogenous S1P reversed SKI II-induced mechanical hyposensitivity in a dose-dependent manner, and observed a maximal effect with 200 nM S1P (Figure 2E). Although quantification of native S1P levels in skin is inaccurate owing to avid lyase activity, our data establish that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on S1PR3-dependent mechanical pain, such that increased S1P does not evoke mechanical hypersensitivity, but diminished S1P leads to mechanical hyposensitivity. These data show that constitutive activation of S1PR3 by S1P is required for normal mechanosensitivity.",

This strategy was used because we found that anti-S1PR3 antibodies showed broad immunoreactivity in DRG from mice lacking S1PR3, and so we instead used anti-DsRed antibodies to probe expression of the S1PR3 fusion protein (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E). We found that 42.4% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-Peripherin, demonstrating that S1PR3 is expressed in a subset of small-diameter neurons. We also observed that 69.5% of S1PR3+ cells co-stained with anti-NF200, which marks medium and large-diameter myelinated neurons. Furthermore, we observed that S1PR3+ cells were primarily of small to medium diameter (11.3–35.1 µm), whereas all cells in the DRG ranged from 11.3 to 53.9 µm. Overall, these data support the expression of S1PR3 in subsets of small-diameter thermal nociceptors and medium-diameter mechanonociceptors (Figure 3F). Additionally, no significant differences were observed between WT and S1PR3 KO DRG in number of Trpa1+, Trpv1+, Peripherin+, NF200+, or IB4+ cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C,F,G).

To examine the effects of S1P on A mechanonociceptors and C nociceptors, we performed ratiometric calcium imaging and electrophysiology on DRG cultures from reporter mice. Interestingly, only 56.1 ± 22.4% of mCherry-expressing neurons were activated by 1 µM S1P (Representative trace in Figure 4B; representative images in Figure 4C), which our dose-response showed to be the saturating concentration for calcium influx (Figure 4D; EC50 = 155 nM). All S1P-responsive neurons were also capsaicin-sensitive (n > 2000 neurons). And while sensory neurons from S1PR3 KO animals did not respond to S1P, as expected, they exhibited capsaicin responses that were not significantly different from WT neurons (Figure 3—figure supplement 1H). The mean diameter of S1P-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 22.4 ± 1.0 µm, whereas the mean diameter of non-responsive mCherry+ neurons was 28.7 ± 3.2 µm (p=0.0002, two-tailed t-test). We also performed whole cell current clamp experiments and, consistent with other studies, found that S1P evoked action potential firing in capsaicin-sensitive small diameter cells (Figure 4E). This shows that only the small-diameter, S1PR3+ putative nociceptors are excited by S1P. We next asked whether the S1PR3+ medium-large diameter neurons represent the mechanonociceptors observed by ISH (Figure 3A). To this end, we asked whether the spider toxin Hm1a, a selective activator of AM nociceptors, triggers calcium influx in S1PR3-expressing trigeminal neurons. Indeed, we found that 44.2 ± 15.1% of Hm1a-responsive neurons expressed mCherry (Figure 4F), consistent with our staining showing expression of S1pr3 in AM nociceptors and the role of Hm1a-responsive neurons in mediating mechanical pain in vivo.",

We found that S1P had no such effects on S1PR3+ medium-diameter cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E). By contrast, S1P triggered a robust increase in input resistance (Figure 5B), consistent with the closure of potassium channels. I-V analysis revealed that the current inhibited by S1P application was carried by potassium (Figure 5C). Additionally, S1P significantly reduced slow, voltage-dependent tail current amplitudes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F; Figure 5D (top)) in an S1PR3-dependent manner (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, center).",

Furthermore, the above properties of the S1P-sensitive current were consistent with the reported electrophysiological properties of KCNQ2/3 channels in DRG neurons. To address whether KCNQ2/3 channels mediated S1P-dependent neuronal excitability, we applied the KCNQ2/3-selective inhibitor XE 991 and found that it completely occluded the effects of S1P on tail current (Figure 5D). Similar results were observed with the related antagonist, linopirdine (Figure 5D). These findings are consistent with S1P/S1PR3-dependent inhibition of KCNQ2/3 in somatosensory neurons.",

While S1P cannot be accurately measured in non-plasma tissues, this is similar to estimated levels of S1P in peripheral tissues, and to levels which rescued mechanosensitivity after local S1P depletion (Figure 2E). Thus, our in vitro IC50 supports our finding that baseline S1P levels are sufficient to maximally exert their effect on mechanical pain. In summary, our electrophysiological and behavioral observations support a model in which baseline S1P/S1PR3 signaling governs mechanical pain thresholds through modulation of KCNQ2/3 channel activity in AM neurons.",

To test this, we utilized ex vivo skin-nerve recordings to analyze the effects of genetic ablation of S1PR3 on AM afferents, which mediate fast mechanical pain sensation. S1PR3 HET animals were used as littermate controls because no significant differences were observed between S1PR3 WT and S1PR3 HET mice in any behavioral assay (Figure 1), and because force-response relationships are comparable between S1PR3 HET AM fibers and wild type AM recordings (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A; see Figure 6—source data 1). Compared to S1PR3 HET, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed reduced sensitivity in their force-response relation (slope for HET versus KO: 50 Hz/N versus 35 Hz/N), as well as attenuated firing over the noxious, but not innocuous, range of mechanical stimulation (Figure 6A). Strikingly, the median von Frey threshold to elicit firing in AM nociceptors was significantly higher in S1PR3 KO animals (3.92 mN) compared to littermate controls (1.56 mN; Figure 6B). Furthermore, S1PR3 KO AM nociceptors displayed a right-shifted cumulative response curve to force-controlled stimuli (50% effective force for HET versus KO: 33.7 versus 60.0 mN; Figure 6C), consistent with the mechanonociceptive hyposensitivity observed in vivo. By contrast, neither AM conduction velocities nor the conduction velocity distributions of Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers differed between genotypes (Figure 6D and Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).",

We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than to static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than their static firing frequency (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapting AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a significantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls (Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These ‘non-responders’ only fired action potentials to high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey filaments (see Methods). The Non-adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-firing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population of AM nociceptors.",

For this purpose, we used an experimental model of inflammatory pain triggered by Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hindpaw, which elicits infiltration of immune cells and thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity. While one previous study proposed that S1PR3 promotes injury-evoked heat and mechanical hypersensitivity, they did not measure or compare post-injury mechanical thresholds to pre-injury baselines for the knockout or control animals. Here, we compared development of CFA-evoked hypersensitivity between S1PR3 HET and KO littermates, since no significant behavioral differences were observed between WT and HET animals in CFA experiments (pvon Frey = 0.12; pradiant heat = 0.12; two-tailed t-tests). Strikingly, S1PR3 KO mice failed to develop thermal hypersensitivity (Figure 7A; see Figure 7—source data 1) relative to heterozygous littermates at both 24 and 48 hr post-CFA injection. In stark contrast, S1PR3 KO animals developed robust mechanical hypersensitivity when thresholds were normalized to account for the dramatic baseline differences between knockouts and control animals (Figure 7B). Our data demonstrate that S1PR3 mediates baseline mechanical sensitivity and is not required for the development of CFA-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity.",

Furthermore, acute S1P/S1PR3 blockade with SKI II or TY elevated mechanical thresholds to pre-CFA, baseline levels (Figure 7D) showing that S1PR3 tunes mechanical pain under normal and inflammatory conditions. These results are consistent with the distinct roles for AM and C nociceptors in mechanical pain. Under normal conditions, AM nociceptors set mechanical pain thresholds. By contrast, under inflammatory conditions, the combined activity of both non-sensitized AM fibers and sensitized C fibers determines overall post-inflammatory mechanical thresholds. Consistent with this model, acute blockade of S1P production or S1PR3 activity under normal conditions induces mechanical hyposensitivity and under inflammatory conditions returns mechanical sensitivity to normal levels.",

Depletion of baseline, endogenous S1P induces mechanical hyposensitivity and nanomolar levels of exogenous S1P are sufficient to restore normal mechanical pain sensitivity after depletion. Second, elevated micromolar S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote thermal, but not mechanical hypersensitivity.

Even in the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P, while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons, immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 which are essential for S1P production. Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues. While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P, future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin to regulate mechanical sensitivity and for increasing S1P under inflammatory/injury conditions to promote pain hypersensitivity.",

Likewise, it was discovered that a subset of somatostatin-expressing spinal interneurons is required for mechanical pain transduction. Although these papers delineate the cells and circuitry of mechanical pain, the molecular underpinnings of mechanonociception in the periphery are poorly understood. While the identity of the transduction channel(s) in AM nociceptors remains enigmatic, understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate excitability will no doubt provide key insights into the function and specialization of the diverse subtypes of mechanosensitive nerve fibers. For example, although Piezo2-hypomorphic animals exhibit normal mechanical pain behaviors, ex vivo skin-nerve recordings show that their AM nociceptors display decreased force-responsiveness, and a recent study found that subpopulations of sensory neurons express different splice variants of Piezo2 that exhibit different force sensitivities. These studies suggest that mechanosensitive neurons exhibit functional specialization on multiple levels. Our study demonstrates that S1PR3 is indispensable for normal function of AM nociceptors, including the adapting AM population, recently discussed in Arcourt et al., that innervates the epidermis and encodes noxious touch. We show that S1PR3 signaling modulates KCNQ2/3 channels to regulate excitability of these A mechanonociceptors (Figure 8).",

Moreover, the link between S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 is echoed in single-cell RNA seq datasets from mouse DRG neurons, which show co-expression of S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 in a subset of myelinated mechanoreceptors. These cells are distinct from the S1pr3/Trpv1 subset that mediates S1P-evoked acute pain and heat hypersensitivity. In addition to being transcriptionally distinct, we show that the mechanisms underlying S1P’s activities in these cells are functionally distinct. Finally, S1pr3 and Kcnq2/3 are highly expressed in human sensory ganglia and recordings from human stem cell-derived sensory neurons show that KCNQ2/3 channels play a key role in mediating their excitability.

We are also the first to examine the role of S1PR3 in a variety of somatosensory behaviors under normal conditions (non-injury, no algogen injection), and to demonstrate a key role for S1PR3 in mechanonociception. We also go beyond previous studies in showing that elevated S1P selectively promotes thermal and not mechanical hypersensitivity. Others have shown that there are distinct cells and molecular pathways that trigger thermal versus mechanical hypersensitivity. For example, thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model is dependent on TRPV1 ion channels and independent of immune cell infiltration. By contrast, infiltration of a subset of myeloid immune cells is required for mechanical hypersensitivity in an inflammatory pain model. Here we show that S1P via S1PR3 signaling is a key component of the inflammatory soup that triggers thermal hypersensitivity in the CFA model. Our observation that S1PR3 KO animals display normal immune cell infiltration and develop mechanical hypersensitivity after CFA is consistent with these previous studies showing distinct mechanisms of inflammatory thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity.",

What distinguishes this study from the others is that S1P signaling is critical for acute mechanical pain, even in the absence of inflammation or exogenously elevated S1P. In the immune system, disruptions in S1P levels or S1PR1 signaling result in significant immune dysfunction and disease. Accordingly, in the somatosensory system, excessive, high levels of S1P (micromolar), such as those present in inflammation, evokes thermal pain and sensitization.

Indeed, fingolimod, a non-selective S1PR modulator, is prescribed as an immunosuppressant for multiple sclerosis treatment, but the possibility that some of its therapeutic effects may also be mediated via the nervous system has not been fully explored. Likewise, one study found that intrathecal fingolimod reduces bone cancer pain, and while analgesia was attributed to effects on S1PR1 in glia, some of the benefits may be due to S1PR3 signaling in DRG neurons. S1PR3 antagonism may also be useful in the treatment of inflammatory pain due to its selective dampening of acute mechanical pain and inflammatory thermal hypersensitivity, while preserving innocuous touch and normal thermal sensitivity. S1PR3 inhibitors may also be beneficial for treating other inflammatory disorders where S1PR3-expressing somatosensory neurons have been shown to contribute to neurogenic inflammation, such as asthma.

            "text": "CFA injections were performed as described above. Briefly, hindpaw skin and underlying fascia of treated and PBS-injected paws were removed from freshly euthanized mice. Skin was placed in RPMI media (Gibco) on ice before mincing with dissection scissors. Digestions were performed for 90 min at 37°C on a rotating platform in 1 mL RPMI supplemented with 1:1000 DNaseI enzyme (Roche) and one unit LiberaseTM (Roche). Skin was then filtered through 70 µm nylon mesh (Falcon), washed in RPMI, and resuspended in PBS for Aqua Live-Dead staining. Samples were then transferred to FACS buffer (PBS with 0.5% FBS and 2 mM EDTA), blocked, then surface stained with the following antibodies: cKit-Biotin, FceRI-PE, CD49b-PECy7, SiglecF-APC, SA-FITC, Ly6C-PerCP, CD11b-PB, Ly6G-BV785, CD45.2-AF700. Compensation tubes (single-stain) were prepared for each fluorophore using positive and negative control beads. A spleen from a wild-type animal was also prepared by crushing between frosted glass slides, straining through 70 µm nylon mesh, and lysing of erythrocytes in ACK (Gibco). A portion of spleen sample was heat-killed for 10 min at 65°C and stained with Aqua viability stain and set aside. The rest of the spleen was stained normally with the other skin samples. Samples were then run through a flow cytometer (BD Fortessa). Data were analyzed using FlowJo (Prism) and Microsoft Excel. Neutrophils were defined as live single cells with the following staining profile: CD45.2+/CD11b+/Ly6G+/Ly6C+. Inflammatory monocytes were defined as the following: CD45.2+/CD11b+/Ly6G-/Ly6Chigh. Total number of immune cells was reported, rather than percentage of total, since neither genotype differed significantly in total number of live cells or total number of CD45.2+ immune cells.",

Values are reported as the mean ±SEM where multiple independent experiments are pooled and reported (for whole cell electrophysiology), and mean ±SD where one experiment was performed with multiple wells (for calcium imaging) or mice (for behavior). For comparison between two groups, Student’s unpaired 2-tailed t-test was used. A paired t-test was employed only for measurements within the same biological replicate and after a given treatment. For single-point comparison between >2 groups, a one-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post hoc test was used, depending on comparison. For the time course comparison between two groups, 2-way ANOVA was used and single comparison p-values were derived using Tukey’s HSD or appropriate statistical test, depending on comparison. Number of mice or samples required to attain significance was not calculated beforehand, and where multiple statistical tests were performed, a Bonferroni correction was applied. In figure legends, significance was labeled as: n.s., not significant, p≥0.05; *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.",

They show that (1) S1PR3 knockout mice show decreased sensitivity for noxious but not innocuous mechanical pain stimuli, (2) injection of either an S1PR3 antagonist or a kinase inhibitor that blocks S1P production also increases withdrawal thresholds, (3) S1PR3 expression in DRG partially overlaps with Npy2r, Piezo2, and Nav1.1, which marks mechosensory DRG neurons, (4) Adelta mechnosensitive fibers show decreased firing rates upon mechanical stimulation in ex vivo skin nerve preparations, and (5) S1P application blocks KCNQ2/3-mediated tail currents in dissocated DRG neuron recordings. While these studies identify an interesting new pathway that sets mechanical pain thresholds, and the authors performed a number of convincing experiments to suggest a role for S1P signaling in Adela fiber physiology, there are a few unresolved questions about the data presented.",

For behavior assays, the authors injected pharmacological reagents at least 30 minutes ahead of time. Thus, it doesn't seem to be very possible that S1P/S1PR3 signaling occurs when VFH was applied to the skin and modulate the mechanical sensitivity in ms. It is more likely that there is a constant baseline ongoing S1P/S1PR3 signaling that helps to set the mechanical pain threshold. How does it exactly happen?

As discussed above, if S1P/S1PR3 signaling is ongoing, would a global null mouse cause developmental deficit or other nonspecific effects that may explain the phenotype? It is also unclear the cell types/location responsible for the phenotype. While the authors do show an acute behavioral effect of a local injection of a S1PR3 antagonist and a blocker of S1P production, it does not exclude that some phenotypes they observed come from developmental deficits. Their overall model would be strengthened by a more careful characterization of the mutant mice. Use of a conditional knockout could address these concerns, either by an inducible Cre to delete S1PR3 in adulthood or restricting deletion to AM fibers. If this is not feasible, the authors could better characterize the knockout mouse, such as expression of known pain genes in DRG neurons or AM fibers, peripheral and central innervations, etc., and the developmental expression of S1PR3 in DRG neurons. For example, if S1PR3 is only expressed in adult DRG neurons, this developmental concern will be eased.",

Do LTMR types express S1pr3? A more thorough characterization of S1pr3 expression (NFH, peripherin, IB4, and other markers) and quantification would be helpful.

Another experiment can be done is that co-injection of SKI II (sphingosine kinase inhibitor) with S1P to determine whether S1P increase the attenuated mechanosensitivity by SKI II.

Also, the authors fail to mention a series of papers from the Nicol lab showing involvement of S1P and S1PRs in pain, including showing that S1P enhances excitability of DRG neurons by reducing a potassium current and also enhancing TTX-resistant sodium current (Zhang et al.,. 2006) and that this effects is diminished using siRNA targeted to S1PR1 and SIPR2 receptors (Li et al., 2015).",

The authors attribute this to closure of Kv7 channels (M-current). The evidence for this particular mechanism is very weak. The standard protocol for M-current is recording the slowly-deactivating outward tail currents when stepping from a steady holding potential of around -40 mV or -30 mv to around -60 mV. Here, the authors measure tail currents at -80 mV following steps to +100 mV. It is very hard to interpret these currents. It does not make sense to try to measure KV7 currents repolarizing to -80 mV, because the driving force on K is so small. In any case, I could not understand in Figure 5D how the authors were making the measurements or what the currents are. There is a sequence of fast-decaying current followed by a slowly-increasing outward current. This looks nothing like a recording of M-current (which would be a monotonically slowly-decaying outward current). The only evidence for it being mediated by Kv7 channels is occlusion by 100 μm linopirdine. This is of doubtful selectivity. The standard inhibitor of M-current (Kv2/Kv3) is XE-991, which acts with an IC50 of less than 1 uM.",

It is not at all obvious from the traces in the hets why the top is classified as \"non-adapting\" and the bottom as \"adapting\".

In fact, the firing during the later stimulus is faster in the \"non-adapting\" fiber than in the \"adapting\" fiber, which seems confusing. One has to go to the Materials and methods section to realize that the distinction is when frequency falls by 2-fold from the initial frequency to the end, so the initial frequency must be much faster in the bottom trace than the top. It would be much clearer if the plots included a trace of frequency averaged over 200 ms intervals or something similar. If that doesn't fit well into the figure, at least the main text should explain the criterion that is being used, and maybe say something like \"the top trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell less than 2-fold over the 5-sec stimulus, to xx Hz. The bottom trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell to xx HZ by the end of the stimulus.\"",

Even in the mature field of S1P signaling in the vascular and immune systems, the cellular source of S1P, while an intriguing question, remains unclear. All cells in the body, including somatosensory neurons, immune cells, and skin cells, express sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, which are essential for S1P production (42). Deletion of both kinases is lethal and attempts to conditionally knockout these kinases fail to completely eliminate S1P in tissues (43). While RNA seq data suggests that somatosensory neurons contain all of the enzymatic machinery required to produce and export local S1P (19, 44) future work will be needed to identify the key cell types that are important for maintaining baseline S1P levels in the skin and regulating mechanical sensitivity.”",

Thus while we see a reduction in mechanically sensitive AM fibers by controlled force stimulation (Figure 6E-F), we observe them in normal proportions based on conduction velocity and suprathreshold von Frey stimulation. 7) We show that the mCherry reporter animals display no S1PR3 expression in epidermal and dermal cells (Figure 3D-F), and single-cell RNA seq of a diverse array of mouse skin cells corroborates this lack of expression (Joost et al. 2016). In addition, we also performed a battery of behavioral tests and found no baseline defects in sensations mediated by proprioceptors, low-threshold mechanoreceptors, thermal nociceptors, or pruriceptors in the KO animals (Figure 1).",

Our previous manuscript focused solely on the effects of S1P signaling on mechanical pain, which is saturated by baseline levels of S1P (~200 nM). However, consistent with Camprubi-Robles et al., that reported spontaneous pain to 500 µM S1P, we also observe that elevated S1P (2 µM or higher) triggers spontaneous pain in the cheek model (Figure 2C). While this other study did not measure mechanical or heat hypersensitivity after S1P injection, our new data now show that the spontaneous pain behaviors induced by elevated S1P are due to heat and not mechanical hypersensitivity and that hypersensitivity is dependent on S1PR3 (Figure 2A-B, D). Overall, our data reveal two key, novel findings. First, S1P/S1PR3 sets baseline mechanical pain thresholds. Second, elevated S1P levels, such as those produced during inflammation or disease, promote heat hypersensitivity, but not mechanical hypersensitivity.",

The authors attribute this to closure of Kv7 channels (M-current). The evidence for this particular mechanism is very weak. The standard protocol for M-current is recording the slowly-deactivating outward tail currents when stepping from a steady holding potential of around -40 mV or -30 mv to around -60 mV. Here, the authors measure tail currents at -80 mV following steps to +100 mV. It is very hard to interpret these currents. It does not make sense to try to measure KV7 currents repolarizing to -80 mV, because the driving force on K is so small. In any case, I could not understand in Figure 5D how the authors were making the measurements or what the currents are. There is a sequence of fast-decaying current followed by a slowly-increasing outward current. This looks nothing like a recording of M-current (which would be a monotonically slowly-decaying outward current). The only evidence for it being mediated by Kv7 channels is occlusion by 100 μm linopirdine. This is of doubtful selectivity. The standard inhibitor of M-current (Kv2/Kv3) is XE-991, which acts with an IC50 of less than 1 uM.",

The voltage protocols for Figure 5C and Figure D are not shown, and it is not explained where tail current was measured. This should be clarified in the Figure legend (based on the previous version, presumably currents were activated by steps to +80 or +100, but I was unclear then and am still unclear at what time after the repolarization to -80 mV the tail currents were measured.). The figure might now work better leaving out Figure C and D (or moving them to the Supplementary figure) but at the least the protocols and measurements need to be explained clearly.",

It is not at all obvious from the traces in the hets why the top is classified as \"non-adapting\" and the bottom as \"adapting\". Both keep firing throughout the stimulus and both show much slower firing in the second half of the stimulus. In fact, the firing during the later stimulus is faster in the \"non-adapting\" fiber than in the \"adapting\" fiber, which seems confusing. One has to go to the Methods to realize that the distinction is when frequency falls by 2-fold from the initial frequency to the end, so the initial frequency must be much faster in the bottom trace than the top. It would be much clearer if the plots included a trace of frequency averaged over 200 ms intervals or something similar. If that doesn't fit well into the figure, at least the main text should explain the criterion that is being used, and maybe say something like \"the top trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell less than 2-fold over the 5-sec stimulus, to xx Hz. The bottom trace shows an example of a non-adapting fiber, in which the initial frequency of xx Hz fell to xx HZ by the end of the stimulus.\"",

            "text": "“A recent study reported that A-nociceptors are composed of two genetically distinct neuronal populations that differ in conduction velocity and in adaptation properties5 (“Adapting AM” versus “Non-adapting AM”). We next asked whether loss of S1PR3 signaling altered these AM subtypes. Adapting AM fibers responded more vigorously to dynamic (ramp) stimuli than static (hold) stimuli, and displayed a mean dynamic firing frequency at least twofold greater than their static firing frequency5 (Figure 6E, upper traces). By contrast, Non-adapting AM fibers often showed bursting during static stimulation, which resulted in similar firing rates during dynamic and static stimulation (Figure 6E, lower traces). S1PR3 KO animals displayed a significantly lower proportion of Adapting AM nociceptors compared with littermate controls (Figure 6F). Additionally, we observed an increase in S1PR3 KO AM fibers that were unresponsive to controlled force stimulation (Figure 6F). These “non-responders” only fired action potentials to high-pressure stimuli with a blunt glass probe or to suprathreshold stimulation with von Frey filaments (see Materials and methods section). The Non-Adapting AMs, and the few remaining mechanosensitive Adapting AMs in the S1PR3 KO displayed similar firing frequencies over both the dynamic and static phases of force application to control fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). This suggests that decreased mechanosensitivity of the Adapting AM population accounts for the significant reduction in force-firing relations observed at the population level in S1PR3 KO AMs (Figure 6A). We conclude that S1PR3 is an essential regulator of both mechanical threshold and sensitivity in a distinct population of AM nociceptors.”",
