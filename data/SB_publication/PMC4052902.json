In the current study, we show that both basal defense and systemic acquired resistance responses are affected in transgenic plants constitutively expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase) which have greatly reduced InsP3 levels. Flagellin induced Ca2+-release as well as the expressions of some flg22 responsive genes were attenuated in the InsP 5-ptase plants. Furthermore, the InsP 5-ptase plants were more susceptible to virulent and avirulent strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. The InsP 5-ptase plants had lower basal salicylic acid (SA) levels and the induction of SAR in systemic leaves was reduced and delayed. Reciprocal exudate experiments showed that although the InsP 5-ptase plants produced equally effective molecules that could trigger PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants, exudates collected from either wild type or InsP 5-ptase plants triggered less PR-1 gene expression in InsP 5-ptase plants. Additionally, expression profiles indicated that several defense genes including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1 were basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared with wild type. Upon pathogen attack, expression of these genes was either not induced or showed delayed induction in systemic leaves. Our study shows that phosphoinositide signaling is one component of the plant defense network and is involved in both basal and systemic responses. The dampening of InsP3-mediated signaling affects Ca2+ release, modulates defense gene expression and compromises plant defense responses.",

The first line of defense is triggered by the recognition of microbial- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMP or PAMP) by the membrane associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (NÃ¼rnberger et al.,; Delledonne,). Pathogen triggered immunity (PTI) also known as basal resistance (Jones and Dangl,), is non-specific and against a range of virulent pathogens. A series of rapid responses are initiated within seconds to minutes of encountering MAMPs including ionic fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of kinase cascades followed shortly by transcriptional reprogramming (reviewed in Postel and Kemmerling,; Gimenez-Ibanez and Rathjen,; Tsuda and Katagiri,).",

The local infected sites undergo programmed cell death to halt pathogen growth as part of the hypersensitive response (HR). HR also involves rapid ion fluxes and production of ROS (reviewed in Torres et al.,) as well as induction of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins. In addition to the local response, distal parts of the plant develop immunity against a broad range of pathogens, known as systemic acquired resistance (SAR). A hallmark of SAR is an increase in salicylic acid (SA). SA accumulates in both distal and infected leaves in response to pathogen attack and treatment with SA or SA analogs can induce the PR genes such as PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 (reviewed in Durrant and Dong,; Fu and Dong,). More recently several other metabolites have been implicated as mobile signals in the development of SAR (Park et al.,; reviewed in Kachroo and Kachroo,; Gao et al.,).",

            "text": "A transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in) is one of the early events associated with both PTI and ETI. The initial increase in Ca2+ upon MAMP recognition is accepted to be via an influx through plasma membrane localized Ca2+ channels, such as cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGC) and/or glutamate receptor (GluRs) channels. In addition, the involvement of intracellular Ca2+ stores in the propagation of the Ca2+ signal is very likely (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz,; McAinsh and Pittman,; Manzoor et al.,). Several downstream defense related events are regulated by Ca2+ including activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) cascades and modulation of Ca2+ binding proteins (reviewed in Ma and Berkowitz,; Wurzinger et al.,; Boudsocq and Sheen,; Romeis and Herde,). The MAMP-triggered oxidative burst also appears to dependent on the initial cytosolic Ca2+ elevation. The NADP oxidase RbohD is directly and indirectly regulated by Ca2+ (Sagi and Fluhr,; Dubiella et al.,). In response to elicitation with flg22, early membrane depolarization events are unaffected in the rbohD mutant (Jeworutzki et al.,) and the cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is similar to wild type plants (Ranf et al.,). A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ is also important for ETI responses and may precede the oxidative burst in response to avirulent pathogens (Grant et al.,). Furthermore, several Ca2+ or calmodulin (CaM) binding transcription factors TGA, CPB60g and CAMTA3, (reviewed in Reddy et al.,) act as both positive and negative regulators of SA accumulation and SA-regulated PR gene expression.",

            "text": "Many lipids and lipid related molecules are thought to play roles in plant defense signaling and responses to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens (reviewed in Shah,; Walley et al.,). However, there is less information on the potential involvement of the phosphoinositide signaling pathway in plant defense. The membrane-associated phospholipids along with the soluble inositol phosphates (collectively known as phosphoinositides) are present in all eukaryotic cells and are implicated in plant responses to many environmental stimuli (see reviews in Stevenson et al.,; Meijer and Munnik,; Krinke et al.,; Im et al.,). In the canonical pathway, phosphatidylinositol is sequentially phosphorylated to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) by the enzymes phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4K) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), respectively. Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) in response to a stimulus or stress leads to the hydrolysis of PtdInsP2 to generate the soluble second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). While many aspects of the phosphoinositide pathway are conserved in plants there are several differences between plants and animals (reviewed in Munnik and Nielsen,; Delage et al.,; Pokotylo et al.,). In plants, DAG is converted to phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), while InsP3 maybe further phosphorylated to form inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6). Both InsP3 and InsP6 are thought to release Ca2+ from intracellular stores (reviewed in Krinke et al.,; Im et al.,; Gillaspy,). Additionally, InsP5 and InsP6 are implicated in hormone signaling via their interaction with the jasmonic acid receptor COI (Sheard et al.,; Mosblech et al.,) and the auxin receptor TIR1 (Tan et al.,), respectively. PtdOH may also be generated by hydrolysis of structural phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) via the phospholipase D (PLD) enzymes. Recent reports implicate PtdOH as an important signaling molecule in plants in both abiotic and biotic stresses (reviewed in Testerink and Munnik,). Using a transgenic inducible system to express type III effectors (AvrRpm1 or AvrRpt2) in planta, a biphasic accumulation of PtdOH was reported involving first PLC and then PLD activation (Andersson et al.,). Furthermore, activation of both PI4K and PLD has been shown to be an early response of suspension cells to treatment with SA (Krinke et al.,). PtdOH-binding targets include the NAD oxidase RbohD and MPK6 protein kinase and PtdOH is implicated in ROS and HR responses (reviewed in Canonne et al.,; Testerink and Munnik,). Specific PLC isoforms may also regulate defense responses (Vossen et al.,; Canonne et al.,). Arabidopsis mutants which have constitutively low InsP6 levels exhibited an increased susceptibility to microbial infections (Murphy et al.,). Collectively these results support the involvement of the phosphoinositides in plant defense; however there are many missing links in our understanding.",

            "text": "In this study, our goal was to further investigate the function of phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the plant defense network. In previous work, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the human type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), which specifically hydrolyzes soluble inositol phosphates and terminates InsP3-mediated signals. These InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants have normal growth and morphology under optimal growth conditions. However, their basal InsP3 levels are greatly reduced, to only ~5% of wild type level (Perera et al.,). The InsP 5-ptase plants exhibit delayed and reduced responses to gravity and impaired Ca2+ signaling in response to salt and cold stimuli (Perera et al.,). The InsP 5-ptase plants were also shown to be less resistant to wounding and herbivory (Mosblech et al.,). Interestingly, a global comparison of basal transcript profiles between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants revealed that 16 out of 62 basally downregulated genes in transgenic plants were defense related (Perera et al.,), including PR-1, PR-2, PR-5, and AIG1(avrRpt2- induced gene1). In the current study, we demonstrate that InsP 5-ptase plants show impaired Ca2+ elevation in response to flg22, decreased expression of several defense related genes and delayed and reduced SAR. Our results support the role of InsP3 as a mediator of the intracellular Ca2+ cascade and highlight the involvement of phosphoinositide-mediated signaling in the development of a robust defense response in plants.",

We first treated wild type and InsP 5-ptase seedlings with the active elicitor peptide flg22 and measured root growth. A greater inhibition of root growth was observed in the InsP 5-ptase seedlings compared to wild type (Figure 1A), indicating that the transgenic plants are more sensitive to flg22. We next monitored Ca2+ induction, ROS production and flg22-associated pathogen-responsive gene expression; which are all known to be triggered by flg22 treatment in Arabidopsis (Gomez-Gomez et al.,; Asai et al.,; Navarro et al.,; Zipfel et al.,; Boudsocq et al.,; Ma et al.,). Treatment with flg22 elicits a rapid rise in cytosolic Ca2+ which can be monitored using aequorin-mediated bioluminescence (Jeworutzki et al.,; Ranf et al.,). InsP 5-ptase seedlings expressing aequorin (Perera et al.,) were treated with flg22 and the intracellular Ca2+ changes were monitored. Upon treatment with flg22, a rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt with a peak at ~2 min was observed in both wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants; however, the induction level was greatly reduced in InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 1B) with an average reduction in the Ca2+ signal of ~44% in the transgenic plants (Figure 1C). As shown by the root growth experiment (Figure 1A), the InsP 5-ptase plants are responsive to flg22; the increased root growth inhibition correlates with the attenuation of the Ca2+ signal. We also monitored the oxidative burst (by measuring H2O2 generation) after elicitation with flg22. An increase in ROS was detected at the first 1â2 min post treatment, which peaked ~5 min, and tapered off returning to the baseline within 25 min (Figure 1D), which was different from the sustained Ca2+ elevation (Figure 1B). Surprisingly, there was no significant difference in ROS generation between wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants. These results demonstrate that although the Ca2+ release after flg22 treatment was dampened, the oxidative burst was not affected.",

In order to further investigate the downstream responses, a group of genes known to be induced by flg22-FLS2 interaction (Asai et al.,; Qutob et al.,; Gust et al.,; Boudsocq et al.,) were selected and their expression levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. The five selected genes were GST1, RLK, FRK1, NHL10, and MLO6. The peak expression of MLO6 was at 30 min after flg22 treatment, whereas the other four genes showed a peak expression at 120 min post flg22 treatment (Figure 1E). Both wild type and InsP 5-ptase plants, showed similar kinetics of induction; however, expression levels at 120 min were significantly reduced in the InsP 5-ptase plants compared to the wild type. The reduction in expression suggests that the InsP 5-ptase plants are unable to sustain or maintain maximal gene induction. Interestingly, FRK1 and NHL10 are both considered to be regulated via MAPK dependent pathways (Boudsocq et al.,) and these results suggest a role for phosphoinositide signaling interacting with the MAPK cascade.",

We found that transgenic plants were less affected than the rps2/rpm1 mutants when challenged with avirulent strains PstDC3000+avrRpt2; and did not have the same high level of bacterial growth (Figure 2C). Therefore, the response of InsP 5-ptase plants to PstDC3000+avrRpt2 is not similar to rps2/rpm1 double mutant which lacks the R gene mediated resistance. The enhanced susceptibility pattern observed in InsP 5-ptase plants is more similar to previously reported mutants with a defect in SA-mediated disease resistance, such as nahG and eds16/sid2 mutants (Gaffney et al.,; Delaney et al.,; Dewdney et al.,; Wildermuth et al.,). These plants with a defect in SA-mediated resistance are more susceptible to avirulent bacterial strains, but not so severely as to virulent bacterial strains, indicating that the R genes in these mutant plants are not affected (Dewdney et al.,). It is possible that the enhanced susceptibility toward avirulent strains might be the result of dampened signal transduction leading to disease resistance. To test this hypothesis, we examined PR-1 gene induction as a downstream response during the course of infection with PstDC3000+avrRpt2 at 3, 8, 24, and 48 h, and found that the two independent InsP 5-ptase lines T6 and T8 show a delayed induction of gene expression (the response was observed at 8 h instead of 3 h) compared to the wild type and vector control plants C2 (Figure 2D).",

These include PR-1, PR-5, and AIG1(avrRpt2- induced gene1), as well as genes encoding proteins involved in Ca2+ storage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) such as CRT3 and BiP3 (Perera et al.,). In this study we used qRT-PCR to analyze a set of selected genes. We determined that, in addition to previously identified defense-related genes, PR-2, two putative glutathione-S-transferase genes (GST11 and GST16) and three protein kinases (CRK7, CRK45, and RLP23) were also basally downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants (Table 1). Among the eleven genes tested, eight of them are also required for SAR according to the GO annotation in TAIR. Although BiP3 has not been annotated as the other eight genes, other BiP isoforms have been shown to play a role in promoting plant immunity (Wang et al.,; Carvalho et al.,). The data suggest that reduced expression of these genes might contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic plants to P. syringae.",

No change in InsP3 levels was observed with mock spray (Figure 3A). These results demonstrate that the induction of InsP3 is one of the signals generated during plant-pathogen interaction.

Plants were first inoculated with PstDC3000+avrRpt2, (two leaves per plant), and then challenged with PstDC3000 by spraying whole plants at day 0, 1, 2, and 3 post first inoculation. To monitor the progression of bacterial growth in systemic leaves, bacterial counts were measured in leaves at day 4 post spray. We found that wild type plants acquired resistance to PstDC3000 around day 3 post first inoculation showing a reduced bacterial growth compared to that at day 0, 1, and 2 (Figure 5A). Although the bacterial growth in InsP 5-ptase plants also declined slightly at day 3, the reduced growth is not statistically significant compared to that at day 0, 1, and 2. The assay result indicates that the SAR response was affected in InsP 5-ptase plants. It could be that the acquired resistance was not induced as much as in the wild type at day 3, (i.e., a delayed response), or it could be that the level of resistance was substantially reduced. No acquired resistance was detected when plants were first mock inoculated with 10 mM MgCl2 (Figure 5B).",

We monitored expression of a total of 47 genes (for a complete gene list see Supplementary Table 1). We found 14 genes that were differentially expressed in the wild type and two transgenic plant lines that were either only induced in the wild type or showed reduced and delayed induction in the transgenic plants (Table 2, calculated data are in Supplementary Table 3). Among these 14 genes, eight of them had low basal expression in the transgenic plants. The remaining six genes, which were not basally low, exhibited a reduced and delayed induction. These genes included NHL10, RLK1, PAD4, and NIMIN-2, which are implicated in SAR and SA-mediated signaling (Zhou et al.,; Li et al.,; Navarro et al.,; Weigel et al.,). To further confirm the qRT-PCR result, we also performed an independent RT-PCR analysis on systemic leaves (Figure 5C) using the marker genes PR-1 and PAD4. The RT-PCR results were consistent with the qRT-PCR data. The results indicate that the expression of a subset of genes involved in SAR were altered, both in timing and extent in the InsP 5-ptase plants.",

These molecules are presumed to be translocated from local inoculated leaves to distal leaves through the phloem tissue. Phloem exudate collected from local leaves provides a means to study the effects of the mobile signals. We performed exudate experiments to examine whether the signal molecules generated from the local infected leaves in wild type can trigger the same response in InsP 5-ptase plants and vice versa. The experimental design is to mimic the process of delivering signal molecules from primary infected leaves to systemic leaves by bypassing the plant delivery system. The exudate from infected plants containing putative signal molecules was collected and injected into healthy uninfected plants. In these experiments, PR-1 gene expression is expected to increase in the new leaves (similar to systemic leaves) upon injection in response to the presence of the signal molecules. We found that exudates collected from InsP 5-ptase plants were equally effective in inducing PR-1 gene expression in wild type plants as exudates from wild type plants (Figure 5D). However, InsP 5-ptase plants showed diminished PR-1 gene expression in response to exudates from either wild type or transgenic plants. These results indicate that the generation of mobile signals at the primary infected site is not impaired in the InsP 5-ptase plants and the exudates were as effective as those produced in wild type. Since the response to exogenous application of SA was also normal in the InsP 5-ptase plants (Figure 4B), these results suggest that InsP 5-ptase plants are affected in either sensing the mobile signal and/or in the synthesis of SA at the systemic site.",

It is reasonable to speculate therefore, that the inability to propagate an InsP3 signal is the primary basis for the altered defense responses exhibited by these plants. However, we cannot rule out potential up and downstream effects of the increased turnover of InsP3, since InsP3 is an intermediate in the phosphoinositide pathway and is linked to both the phospholipids and the inositol phosphates. In previous work, we showed that PIP5K activity and PtdInsP2 synthesis was upregulated in transgenic tobacco cells in suspension culture expressing InsP 5-ptase (Perera et al.,). Under normal growth conditions, in our hands, we have not detected a up regulation of PtdInsP2 synthesis in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings or plants.

            "text": "InsP3 signaling in plants remains a controversial topic primarily due to the fact that at a molecular level, an InsP3 responsive Ca2+ channel (analogous to the animal InsP3 receptor) has not been identified in plant genomes (discussed in Krinke et al.,; Munnik and Nielsen,). Nevertheless, many studies have demonstrated that InsP3 is a physiological ligand (reviewed in Krinke et al.,; Dodd et al.,; Pokotylo et al.,) and InsP3 changes occur rapidly and transiently in response to wide variety of both abiotic and biotic signals/stimuli (reviewed in Krinke et al.,; Im et al.,). It has also been suggested that InsP6 rather than InsP3 is the ligand responsible for Ca2+ release from intracellular plant stores (Lemtiri-Chlieh et al.,). Since InsP3 is an intermediate in the lipid-dependent route of InsP6 biosynthesis (reviewed in Gillaspy,), increased InsP3 turnover could be expected to affect InsP6 levels and indeed the InsP 5-ptase plants have lower InsP6 levels compared to wild type (Perera et al.,). Increased susceptibility to several microbial pathogens was reported in low InsP6 mutants (Murphy et al.,). However, (unlike the InsP 5-ptase plants), these mutants had normal basal levels of SA and normal SA induction upon infection. Therefore we cannot attribute all of the attenuated defense responses of the InsP 5-ptase plants to a decrease in InsP6. Other inositol phosphate intermediates, including InsP4 and InsP5 are implicated in stress responses (reviewed in Pokotylo et al.,). It is conceivable that InsP6 (and/or other inositol phosphates) act synergistically with InsP3 to mediate signaling leading to defense responses.",

A rise in cytosolic Ca2+ is one common signaling element in response to both PTI and ETI and Ca2+ may be a primary signal essential for initiating many of the early events; however there are differences in the timing and duration of the PTI and ETI associated Ca2+ signals.

A similar result was reported using intact leaves exposed to flg22 (Ma et al.,). Intriguingly, the InsP 5-ptase plants exhibited a normal Ca2+ response to the plant derived peptide elicitor Pep3 (Ma et al.,). The Pep receptor PEPR is linked to the cyclic nucleotide gated cation channel CNGC2 (Qi et al.,; Ma et al.,). Interestingly, the cngc2 mutant showed an opposite Ca2+ response to the InsP 5-ptase plants; an attenuated Ca2+ rise in response to Pep3 but a normal Ca2+ response to flg22 (Ma et al.,). This result supports the involvement of different pathways of Ca2+ influx in response to Pep and flg22. It was suggested that Pep primarily targets extracellular stores (via influx by CNGC2) while flg22 may involve an additional contribution from intracellular stores. Detailed studies of the amplitude and kinetics of flg22 dose-dependent Ca2+ changes also suggested that two processes or two different stores may be involved in the flg22 induced Ca2+ response (Jeworutzki et al.,; Ranf et al.,).",

The InsP3 responsive Ca2+ store is likely to be the ER or vacuole; however we cannot rule out the involvement of the chloroplast (Manzoor et al.,). A plant specific Ca2+ sensor protein CAS, which is located in the chloroplasts, was recently shown to play a role in both PTI and ETI (Nomura et al.,). There are shared similarities in the response of the cas-1 mutant and the InsP 5-ptase transgenic plants in defense signaling, such as increased susceptibility to both virulent and avirulent bacterial strains, basally reduced PR-1 gene expression and normal ROS generation in response to flg22. However at present, we have no information on whether InsP3 (and/or InsP6) may affect Ca2+ stores in the chloroplast. The basal down regulation of PR genes and the reduced activation of PR gene expression in the InsP 5-ptase plants may also reflect alterations in ER Ca2+ homeostasis as discussed further below.",

The reduced levels of SA in InsP 5-ptase plants suggest a link between PI-metabolism and SA accumulation/pathway through a yet unknown mechanism that ultimately affects plant defense, either directly or indirectly. At a transcriptional level, based on previous microarray results (Perera et al.,), we have not detected lower expression of the two key genes involved in SA biosynthesis, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and isochorismate synthase (ICS1), (Wildermuth et al.,). ABA has been implicated as a negative regulator of SA due to their overlapping biosynthetic pathways (de Torres Zabala et al.,; reviewed in Cao et al.,). However, we did not detect increased basal ABA levels in InsP 5-ptase plants (Perera et al.,). Another possibility is that expression of genes encoding positive regulators of SA accumulation (reviewed in Lu,; Ng et al.,), could be impaired in InsP 5-ptase plants, resulting in lowered SA levels. One of these genes is PAD4, which showed a delayed induction in systemic leaves (Table 2). Similar to InsP 5-ptase plants, mutants of this group of genes have reduced SA accumulation and enhanced susceptibility to pathogens which could be rescued by exogenous SA treatment (Zhou et al.,). Recent studies also point to the involvement of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) in modulating SA biosynthesis. SARD1 and CBP60g, are two related transcription factors which control SA biosynthesis by regulating ICS1 expression. Interestingly, CBP60g is a calmodulin-binding protein and its activity is Ca2+-dependent (Zhang et al.,; Truman and Glazebrook,). It is possible that the reduced Ca2+ response in InsP 5-ptase plants might affect induction and accumulation of SA via CBP60g activity.",

Additionally, induction of PR-1 was delayed in local leaves and several SAR related genes were either not induced or delayed in induction in systemic leaves (Figure 2D, Table 2). We suggest that these genes are in part under the control of SA and Ca2+/CaM which can regulate transcription by either directly or indirectly interacting with transcription factors (review Dong,; Kim et al.,; Reddy et al.,). The DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor CAMTA (or SR) is enhanced by Ca2+/CaM binding (review, Finkler et al.,). Arabidopsis CAMTA3 acts as a negative regulator of biotic stress responses. The loss-of-function mutants have elevated levels of SA and exhibit enhanced disease resistance. Additionally, several defense-associated genes (including PR genes) are found to be up-regulated in camta3 mutants (Galon et al.,; Du et al.,).",

We have noted a striking inverse correlation between genes that are basally down regulated in the InsP 5-ptase plants and genes that are upregulated in camta3 and cngc2 (Supplementary Table 4). Twelve of the basally upregulated genes in cngc2, and thirteen of the upregulated genes in camta3 were found downregulated in InsP 5-ptase plants (Perera et al.,) including PR-1, PR-2, and PR-5 (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, there was strong overlap between this subset of genes and the top 50 candidates in the PR-1 coexpression network as well as with genes that upregulated in wild type seedlings grown under high Ca2+ conditions (Chan et al.,).

Most TGAs act as positive regulators to induce PR genes as well as the expression of genes encoding ER resident proteins involved in protein folding and Ca2+ storage. The induction of the protein secretory pathway is required for SAR (Wang et al.,).
