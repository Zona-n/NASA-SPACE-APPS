Our previous studies showed that mice exposed to space for 13.5 days had decreased glutathione levels, suggesting impairments in oxidative defense. Here we performed unbiased, unsupervised and integrated multi-‘omic analyses of metabolomic and transcriptomic datasets from mice flown aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis. Enrichment analyses of metabolite and gene sets showed significant changes in osmolyte concentrations and pathways related to glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, likely consequences of relative dehydration of the spaceflight mice. However, we also found increased enrichment of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and purine metabolic pathways, concomitant with enrichment of genes associated with autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome. When taken together with a downregulation in nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2-mediated signaling, our analyses suggest that decreased hepatic oxidative defense may lead to aberrant tRNA post-translational processing, induction of degradation programs and senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction in response to the spaceflight environment.",

Radiation is known to induce single (SSB) and double strand (DSB) DNA breaks, permanently damaging nuclear and mitochondrial DNA and leading to early apoptosis or necrosis. At low-dose/low-dose rates, radiation immediately triggers oxidative stress via a spike in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Acute psychological stress increases hepatic lipid peroxidation as well as levels of ROS, however chronically stressed animals compensate. Therefore, exposure to the space environment, characterized by changes in physiological and psychological stress, as well as exposure to low-dose/low-dose rate radiation, may systemically alter ROS levels in a complex fashion.",

This can lead to cell cycle arrest, activation of senescence or apoptosis and upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules, causing widespread organelle, cell and tissue damage. Under conditions of chronic exposure to oxidative stress (such as in spaceflight), an imbalance occurs between ROS production and antioxidant quenching resulting in increased cellular and tissue damage. Mitochondria are particularly vulnerable to damage by excess ROS and we hypothesized that the liver, a mitochondria-rich metabolic organ, may be a target of spaceflight-induced deficits. In support of this hypothesis, astronauts were shown to exhibit a mild diabetogenic phenotype following spaceflight, the severity of which was linked with flight duration.",

Other spaceflight-induced changes in hepatic genes linked to oxidative defense have also been observed. Our targeted analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets obtained from livers of spaceflight mice showed dysregulation of pathways involved in both lipid metabolism and the immune response, with signs of retinoid export and activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathways suggestive of nascent hepatic fat accretion and collagen deposition.

The scores plot of the PLS-DA analysis demonstrates clear separation between the FLT mice (green) and AEM controls (red) (Figure 1A). Volcano plot analysis (Figure 1B) shows that 10 biochemicals increased in FLT mice with a fold change (FC) greater than 2 and a p (corr)-value less than 0.05, while only 3 biochemicals decreased in the FLT mice as compared to the AEM controls (Table 1) from a total of 14 upregulated (FC > 2) and 11 downregulated (FC < 0.5) biochemicals (Figure S1A and Table S1). Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) analysis of the top 15 most important features contributing to the clustering is plotted in Figure S1B and the most significant features in the volcano plot also appear within the top 15 VIP features. Hierarchical clustering with organization of features by VIP score (Figure 1C) also shows clear separation of metabolite features between the two groups, with relatively fewer metabolites decreased in abundance in the FLT mice as compared with the AEM controls.",

Significance was determined by two-tailed Student’s t-test. A fold-change cutoff was not applied, therefore some of the significant metabolites differ from those identified in the volcano plot. When enrichment analysis was performed using all metabolites, relatively few p (corr)-values for enriched metabolite sets reached significance (p < 0.05). However, the top several sets (methionine metabolism, branched chain fatty acid oxidation, betaine metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism) were retained when the limited subset of metabolites was used for analysis (Figure 2B).

The glycine, serine and threonine metabolism enrichment score was based on decrease of cystathionine and increase of betaine and dimethylglycine. Eight other metabolites contributed to the enrichment, however their abundance changes were not significant between groups. The glutathione metabolism enrichment score was based on decreased abundance of glutathione and cysteinylglycine in FLT mice as compared with AEM controls, with additional contributions from four non-significantly changing metabolites. Fatty acid oxidation enrichment scores (both branched chain and very long chain) were based on abundance of propionylcarnitine and carnitine, with coenzyme A and acetyl carnitine contributing to the score as well. It should be noted that MetaboAnalyst does not recognize many lipids, therefore lipid metabolic pathways are likely under-represented. Contributors to enrichment of methionine metabolism were similar to those of betaine metabolism and consisted primarily of betaine, dimethylglycine and choline, with additional contributions from S-adenosylhomocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, suggesting activation of the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) cycle in the FLT mice. Abundances of these metabolites in FLT mouse livers and AEM controls are summarized in Table S2. For validation, metabolite pathway analysis was performed and similar pathways were found to have a high impact score based on enrichment and topology analysis (Figure S2).",

            "text": "We previously reported a significant increase in abundance of betaine in FLT livers. Betaine is metabolized from choline, which decreased in FLT mice. Betaine is also a methyl donor and provides the methyl group for metabolism of homocysteine to methionine, generating dimethylglycine as well. Furthermore, the transmethylation cycle provides substrates used for the synthesis of cystathionine and GSH via transsulferation; labile methyl groups are required for these processes as well as support of folate metabolism and synthesis of methylated compounds. Since methionine is lost in the transmethylation pathway, it is possible that choline is supplied to preserve pathway function. However, the observed increase in abundance of betaine with a concomitant decrease in cystathionine and GSH suggests increased choline metabolism in spaceflight is not linked to augmented activation of one carbon metabolic pathways, since abundance levels of relevant metabolites such as S-adenosylhomocysteine, serine, sarcosine and glycine are unchanged. Therefore, other mechanisms are likely involved.",

Shown in Figure 3, histological assessment confirms that spaceflight indeed results in increased presence of inflammatory cells as well as augmented steatosis. Although we previously measured upregulation of mRNA expression levels of PPAR-α, a transcriptional regulator of fatty acid oxidation, it is likely that PPAR activation is mediated through increased retinol abundance instead of elevated choline. Choline may be replenished by recycling from phosphatidylcholine, which may impair integrity of lipid membranes. Metabolomics analysis of choline-containing lysolipids revealed an average 40% decrease in abundance of these lipids in FLT mice as compared to AEM controls, although differences between groups were not significant for individual features (Figure S3). These results suggest that augmented metabolism of betaine, in excess of what is needed for methionine metabolism, may lead to injurious choline deficits in spaceflight mice. Whether this is causally related to decreased glutathione and the ability to respond to oxidative stress remains an open question.",

Water intake in FLT mice was decreased by ~20% as compared to AEM controls, although food intake was unchanged (Table 2), therefore a likely cause for the upregulation of betaine is dehydration. We also measured upregulation of taurine, another osmolyte. Abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate was strikingly decreased (Figure S1A) and was the most important feature contributing to the clustering of groups in the PLS-DA analysis (Figure S1B). Guanidino compounds are metabolized from arginine, and dehydration modifies abundance of these compounds in the kidney. Kidney injury not only results in reduced arginine synthesis but change in levels of guanidino compounds and their metabolism in muscles and liver. The marked decrease in abundance of 4-guanidinobutanoate may therefore be associated with dehydration in the FLT mice. Many of the most striking changes in metabolite and transcript abundances appeared to be related to increased dehydration of the FLT mice as compared to AEM controls; although this is a possible limitation of the study, a recent proteomics study on livers from male mice in the “Bion-M1” study flown in space for 30 days and re-acclimated showed results similar to those from our previously published data. Therefore, either the Bion-M1 mice were also dehydrated, or the enriched pathways that we measured indeed have functional significance, potentially related to a shift in metabolic requirements due to unloading. Taken together, the data suggest that dehydration, coupled with oxidative stress, combine to deplete choline stores, leading to impaired lipid membrane metabolism and contributing to increased steatosis in livers from mice exposed to spaceflight.",

Our previous studies found significant alterations in both mRNA and metabolites associated with activation of PPAR-mediated pathways, as well as alterations in fatty acid oxidation in response to spaceflight. Furthermore, as peroxisomes catalyze redox reactions and are potential regulators of oxidative stress-mediating signaling pathways, it is possible that peroxisomes and mitochondria may cooperate to determine cell fate decisions. Specifically, peroxisomes house several enzymes that can produce or degrade ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and therefore may act as modulators of oxidative balance. Recent studies have shown that disturbances in peroxisomal metabolism play a role in the accumulation of cellular damage due to oxidative stress and therefore, cellular aging. There is also evidence that peroxisomes can act as upstream initiators of mitochondrial ROS signaling pathways. However, the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are yet to be fully elucidated.",

This algorithm performs an enrichment analysis to determine whether the observed genes and metabolites in a given pathway appear more often than expected by random chance within the dataset. An additional topology analysis evaluates whether a given gene or metabolite plays an important role in a biological response based on its position within a pathway. An over-representation analysis based on hypergeometric testing using 17,403 genes and 247 metabolites was used for the enrichment analysis and topology was assessed with “Betweenness Centrality”, which measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to all others passing through a given node within the pathway. Integrated analysis of both genes and metabolites (Figure 6A) confirmed the impact of spaceflight on lipid membrane metabolism. Eight of the top 20 enriched pathways relate to lipid membrane metabolism (including glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, glycophosphatidylinositol-anchor biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism). Previously, we reported that Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed endocytosis as an enriched gene pathway, which was also the most highly enriched pathway in the gene-centric analysis (Figure 6B). Enrichment of inflammatory pathways was also evident by the presence of multiple pathways related to cancer. Supporting our other metabolite set enrichment analysis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism had high enrichment and topology scores in the metabolite-centric analytical workflow (Figure 6C).",

In our analyses, we observed enrichment of sphingolipid biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism, as well as alterations in peroxisome gene expression levels, suggesting that spaceflight may alter peroxisome-related signaling pathways, including sphingolipids, to regulate cellular processes. Sphingolipids, specifically, are important messengers for signaling events resulting in activation of cellular proliferation, differentiation or senescence. Furthermore, sphingolipids have been linked to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in hepatocytes, suggesting a potential role of sphingolipids in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. These results therefore indicate a potential connection between peroxisome redox metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative stress mediated by sphingolipid signaling pathways and resulting in upregulation of inflammatory/stress-related signaling, such as NF-κB.",

Post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs critically influences tRNA functions such as folding, stability and decoding. Defects in tRNA modifications and modification enzymes are associated with oxidative stress and human diseases including cancer, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Indeed, results from a recent study in Caenorhabditis elegans associating defects in post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial tRNAs with dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation suggest that the cell's maladaptive response to hypomodified mitochondrial tRNAs may be a mechanism underlying disease development. Although speculative, the idea that exposure to the space environment may lead to aberrant tRNA post-transcriptional modifications is provocative and warrants further investigation.",

The first cluster focused on nucleic acid metabolism and included purine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. Purine metabolism enrichment was dominated by strong upregulation of phosphodiesterase 4D (Pde4d, Table 3), an enzyme with 3′,5′-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) phosphodiesterase activity that degrades cAMP, an important second messenger mediating signaling in multiple pathways. Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 2 (Ampd2, Table 3), an enzyme that converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and maintains cellular guanine nucleotide pools, was downregulated, potentially attenuating protein synthesis. This protein also mediates gluconeogenesis in the rodent liver and, together with Pde4d upregulation (Table 3), suggests pathways impacting cellular quiescence may be altered by spaceflight.",

Specifically, exposure of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to spaceflight following addition of osteogenic differentiation factors resulted in increased expression of genes related to neural development, neural morphogenesis and transmission of nerve impulses and synapses in studies conducted on the International Space Station. This same study found increased expression of cell cycle arrest molecules indicating either increased differentiation of cells in space or activation of cellular quiescence or senescence. Our previous studies have also found significant alterations in the proliferation and differentiation potential of both embryonic and bone marrow stem cells during 13–15 days of spaceflight, with upregulation of the cell cycle arrest and senescence marker cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKN)1a/p21. Notably, analysis of our liver transcriptome dataset also found upregulation of CDKN1a/p21 (3.15 fold, p (corr) < 0.05, Table 3), as well as upregulation of INK4C/p18 with concomitant attenuation of cyclin gene expression (Figure S4). Similarly, GeneSet Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using our whole transcriptome profile showed alterations in several pathways, including quiescent cell activation, cell cycle regulation, and activation of oxidative phosphorylation. When taken in total, these results suggest potential systemic induction of cellular senescence due to short-term exposure to the space environment.",

We performed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis as shown in Figure S5 and determined that the components of the 20S proteasome were significantly upregulated, supporting the observed pattern of molecular catabolism.

Autophagy primarily mediates the degradation of long-lived proteins and organelles, maintaining intracellular homeostasis. Since activation of the proteasome is associated with increased autophagy, we used BIOMART to obtain a list of genes associated with autophagy GO terms and screened that list for expression changes using EGAN (Figure 8). We found significant upregulation in expression of a number of genes, including Atg2a, important for autophagosome formation as well as regulation of lipid droplet morphology and dispersion; microtubule-associated genes (Map1lc3a, Map1lc3b); Wipi1 and 2, involved in pre-autophagosome formation and the autophagy response to starvation; and Mtor, a central mediator of cellular response to stressors such as DNA damage and oxidative stress, supporting our GSEA results (Table 3). Alterations in the rate of autophagy have been shown to regulate ROS formation and redox balance under specific circumstances. However, proteins damaged by ROS/RNS form protein aggregates that are degraded through the 20S proteasome in order to maintain cellular homeostasis. Exposure to chronic or sustained oxidative stress can lead to inactivation of the proteasome, resulting in accumulation of protein conjugates. Heavily oxidized protein aggregates are also not suitable for degradation by the proteasome. These aggregates may be specific targets of autophagy-related pathways mediated by heat shock protein chaperones, which were also altered in our analyses (Table 3). These results suggest that spaceflight leads to upregulation of multiple autophagy-related pathways and are consistent with activation of the proteasome and attenuation of protein synthesis in livers from FLT mice as compared with AEM controls.",

Several studies have characterized the molecular mechanisms involved in regeneration of the liver in response to a variety of stress conditions and in response to partial hepatectomy (PHx), whereby a significant portion of the rodent liver is removed and the remaining portion regenerates and restores the liver to its original size. This process is highly regulated and includes several distinct stages, including withdrawal of hepatocytes from quiescence, cell cycle entry and progression, cessation of cell division and return of hepatocytes to quiescence. Although hepatocytes are the first cells to replicate, they are followed sequentially by other cell types within the liver including stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells.",

This also coincides with considerable damage to the mitochondria, reduced β-oxidation and reduced intrahepatic ATP generation, leading to dysregulation of hepatocellular lipid stores. As we found mild upregulation of autophagy-related genes as well as upregulation of senescence, it is possible that autophagy pathways were initially activated to degrade oxidized proteins. However, as chronic oxidative stress has been shown to induce hepatocyte senescence, it is likely that senescence signaling pathways were activated in response to accumulation of oxidized proteins and failure of autophagy mechanisms to clear these proteins. Indeed, other studies have also demonstrated links between increased oxidative stress and increased hepatocyte senescence, resulting in steatosis due to mitochondrial dysfunction. This senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction is a regulated process driven by signaling through p21 and through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), both of which we found to be upregulated in the current study (Table 3). Such changes are very similar to those that occur during ageing and obesity-related pathologies, such as insulin resistance, and have been associated with impaired energy generation and increased production of ROS. Studies conducted by us and others have shown spaceflight leads to increased oxidative stress, increased insulin resistance, and systemic induction of aging-related pathologies. It is possible that in the liver, increased oxidative stress and altered autophagy pathways may cause hepatocyte senescence through activation of p21 and mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in hepatic steatosis (as we previously reported) and impaired regenerative capacity. These molecular changes may have important implications for the onset of obesity-related diseases and regenerative health in the course of long-duration space exploration.",

Metabolite features were measured using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Thermo-Finnigan LTQ-FT MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in two independent injections using separate dedicated columns as described previously. One aliquot was analyzed in positive ion mode under acidic conditions and gradient eluted from a Waters BEH C18 2.1 mm × 100 mm column, containing 1.7 µm resin, using water and methanol as mobile phases with both containing 0.1% formic acid. The other aliquot was analyzed in negative ion mode using basic conditions, which also employed water/methanol, and contained 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate for ion pairing. Mass spectrometric analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MS2 scans using dynamic exclusion, scanning from 80–1000 m/z. Accurate mass measurements were made on precursor ions with greater than 2 million counts; typical mass error was less than 5 ppm.",
