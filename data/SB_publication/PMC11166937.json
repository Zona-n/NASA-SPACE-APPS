Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exposed to short term (25 hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.",

Multiple studies have described immune dysregulation in short or long-term simulated or actual microgravity. For the most part, such studies have described impaired T-cell responses, coupled with some form of heightened innate immunity, though some innate immune cells, like natural killer (NK) cells, also show impaired function. Consistent with altered adaptive immunity, potentially due to impaired cytotoxic and Th1 T cell function, and reduced NK cell function, astronauts develop increased reactivation of latent viruses, including herpes viruses (EBV, CMV, VZV). In one study, viral shedding after 9–14 days of spaceflight was linked to changes in serum cytokines, including a preferential large increase in IL-4 compared to interferon (IFN)γ, indicating a possible shift away from Th1 immunity towards Th2 immunity. Consistently, some astronauts report heightened hypersensitivity reactions, such as increased allergic and Th2-like responses in space.",

            "text": "Multiple studies using higher throughput approaches have started to add insight into pathways impacted by spaceflight. In the Twins study, a one-year ISS mission altered innate, adaptive, and NK cell-mediated immunity across bulk RNA sequencing analysis. In T cells, increases in DNA methylation were seen in the promoters of notch3 for CD4+ T cells, linked to T cell differentiation, and in scl1a5/asct2, linked to activation, for CD8+ T cells. A total of 50 of 62 assayed cytokines were also altered by spaceflight or landing. During a recent multi-omic analysis, including bulk RNA and DNA methylation sequencing, of astronauts and mice in space, mouse organs such as the liver and kidney demonstrated reduced IFN signatures, coupled to altered methylation patterns of these gene sets, while muscles had increased IFNγ, IL-1, and TNF. Serum inflammatory markers from 59 astronauts in this study (and in a similar companion study) showed increased VEGF-1, IGF-1, and IL-1 during spaceflight, which resolved upon returning to Earth. This same study also identified mitochondrial dysfunction as a major response of different non-hematolymphoid tissues to spaceflight. More recently, another study using a NASA-developed Rotating Wall Vessel, which was employed in our current work, utilized a 41-parameter mass cytometry approach to show that short-term (18–22 hours) simulated microgravity can dampen NK cell, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell responses to Concanavalin A/anti-CD28 stimulation, but potentiates STAT5 signaling to boost Tregs.",

Interestingly, mechanical forces are emerging as critical orchestrators of immune cell function, whereby mechanotransduction tunes immune cell responsiveness to danger signals. Some of these effects occur through environmental modulation of mechanosensing pathways that alter ion currents in cells, metabolism, or directly act on the cytoskeleton. Thus, a spaceflight environment, which alters forces such as gravity, associated hydrostatic pressure, and shear force onto immune cells likely directly contributes to immune system dysfunction.",

The 16-hour-conditioning time point was chosen based on prior work that used approximately the same time and tracked transcriptional or proteomic changes on immune cells to simulated microgravity. PBMCs were either left unstimulated or stimulated for an additional 9 hours with R848, a standard TLR7/8 agonist. We chose TLR7/8 as a putative target since it mimics viral infection, and is expressed on most human immune cells, including T cells. Using this methodology, we next developed a single-cell atlas of 55,648 human PBMCs exposed to these conditions.",

Simulated microgravity altered proportions of immune cell clusters to a mild extent, with B intermediate cells, and MAIT cell proportions being most negatively impacted, and CD14+ monocytes, and CD4+ T effector memory (TEM) cells being most increased based on percent change (Fig. 1B). Across all immune populations, simulated microgravity altered expression of over 4500 genes with adj P cutoff of <0.05 (Supplementary Data 1). This list was refined to a core list of ~375 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with an additional cutoff of |log2FC|> 0.1. This list was further condensed to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|> 0.25 (Fig. 1C), showing only the very top positively and negatively altered genes. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Across all immune cells, some of the most induced genes in simulated microgravity included acute response genes such as s100a8, s100a9, s100a12, thbs1, heat-shock genes such hsp90ab1, chemokines like ccl2, ccl4, iron storage genes (fth1, ftl), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp9). The most reduced genes in simulated microgravity included interferon response (stat1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1), and cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp). Expression of the top DEGs (with mitochondrial encoded genes excluded for visual simplicity) across 22 populations of immune cells are shown in Fig. 1D. CD14+ classical monocytes, CD16+ nonclassical monocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells exhibited the most pronounced changes across major gene sets, consistent with short term simulated microgravity’s direct effect at reprogramming transcriptional changes most prominently in innate immunity. Consistently, using single-cell trajectory analysis, we identify numerous trajectories mainly in the innate immune cell clusters, especially the monocyte cluster, in response to simulated microgravity. Trajectory analysis is used to construct a path that describes how cells move through different states, and the numerous states seen in the monocyte cluster in simulated microgravity may reflect an increased capacity to generate distinct transcriptional states to simulated microgravity (Fig. 1E).",

We mapped the gene expression signatures of individual immune cells, and overall immune signatures, against two recently developed inflammatory signatures of aging, the inflammatory age (iAge) clock, and the SenMayo list of senescence associated secretory inflammatory products. Simulated microgravity induced a significant enrichment in inflammaging related genes, consistent with the notion that short term simulated microgravity can induce aging-like inflammatory changes in unstimulated immune cells (Fig. 2A, B, Supplementary Fig. 2A). Next, because both spaceflight and aging are associated with reactivation of latent viruses, we mined the meta-transcriptome of our single-cell analysis with meta-transcriptome detector (MTD) pipeline. Surprisingly, we saw that as little as 25 hours of simulated microgravity could induce the transcription of latent retroviruses and mycobacteria within human immune cells (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Figs. 2B, C and 3), directly implicating microgravity itself as a contributing trigger for latent pathogen activation. We confirmed the meta-transcriptome results with a different alignment tool, and we could still detect increases in Gammaretrovirus and Mycobacterium canettii transcripts seen with MTD pipeline (Supplementary Fig. 2B, C).",

Across APC donors and recipient T cells, we identified numerous significantly predicted ligand-receptor interactions to be elevated in simulated microgravity vs 1G. For instance, monocytes and dendritic cells induced IL-1 proteins while some B cells provided IL-23A, and IL-7. All APCs provided unique chemokine signals to T cells. Mmp9, ccl2, and thbs1 were amongst our most significantly induced genes in simulated microgravity, and the products of these genes show differential predicted receptor expression (e.g., CD44, CD47, ITGB1, CCR4, CCR5) in T cells (Supplementary Figs. 4–6) but all show predicted enhanced target gene expression in T cells.

As with the unstimulated data, we refined this list to a core gene list of ~317 DEGs based on |log2FC| of >0.2. This list was further reduced to visualize on a Volcano plot with |log2FC|>0.25 (Fig. 3C), showing only the most positively and negatively altered genes. Some of the most induced genes by simulated microgravity over 1G in response to TLR7/8 agonist included cytokines and chemokines, such as ccl8, ccl4, ccl7, cxcl8, and il1b, and acute response proteins like s100a8, s100a9, s100a11, and thbs1. Additional genes induced in simulated microgravity were linked to tryptophan breakdown (ido1), mitochondrial antioxidant defense (sod2), the cytoskeleton (rhoq), and iron storage genes like fth1, ftl. The most downregulated genes when comparing simulated microgravity to 1G during TLR7/8 stimulation, included genes belonging to guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), which were the most reduced set of genes by fold change and adj P, as well as interferon pathway genes, like irf1, stat1, isg20, ifi16, cold shock genes (rbm3, cirbp), cell killing genes (prf1, gzmb) and T/NK cell activation markers like cd69. Many of these genes were consistently altered by simulated microgravity alone without stimulation, indicating a conserved response, even in the setting of additional exogenous stimulation with a TLR ligand. Expression of top DEGs across 19 populations of immune cells is shown in Fig. 3D. Volcano plots of DEGs for individual immune cell clusters are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7. CD14+ monocytes, NK cells, CD8+ TEM, and CD4+ TCM cells showed the most significant changes in the top most altered genes induced by TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity.

Major pathways reduced across most immune cells in simulated microgravity included PKR in interferon response (and associated eif2 signaling), interferon signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, pyroptosis signaling, cytotoxic T cell mediated killing of target cells and death receptor signaling. Major pathways induced by short term simulated microgravity included sirtuin signaling, fibrosis signaling, signaling by Rho GTPases, BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, HIF1α signaling, acute phase response and associated HMGB1 signaling, amongst others. These pathways are consistent with microgravity facilitating innate like inflammation at the expense of interferon driven adaptive immunity and adaptive immune effector function (e.g., CD8+ T cell killing). Despite some similarities in pathways altered to simulated microgravity alone (Fig. 1F), we actually detected a lower iAge score globally across all immune populations in simulated microgravity plus TLR7/8 compared to 1G controls (Fig. 4A). While the reason for this finding is unclear, it appears to have been driven by a highly significant reduction in score by naive B cells, naive CD4+ T cells, and reductions in lesser studied PBMC populations, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)s and double negative T cells. Lower iAge also could be reflective of altered immune activation in simulated microgravity, such as seen in CD16+ monocytes (Fig. 4A, right panel).

Under 1G conditions, stimulation led to a marked induction of CD4+ TCM, at the expense of CD14+ monocytes and CD4+ naive T cells, coupled to an expected pronounced inflammatory gene signature, including marked induction of interferon inducible genes, gbp transcripts, and chemokines across most immune cell populations (Supplementary Fig. 12A–E). Under simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced CD4+ TCM, at the expense of naive CD4+ T cells, though proportions of CD14+ monocyte populations did not reduce as seen in 1G (Supplementary Fig. 12F, G). In simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced a robust expression of inflammatory genes, including interferon inducing genes across most cell types (Supplementary Fig. 12H–J). Next, to determine the sensitivity of individual immune cell populations to TLR7/8 agonist in 1G vs simulated microgravity, we compared the differences in responsiveness to stimulation. We subtracted the fold change induction in 1G from induction in simulated microgravity to determine sensitivity to stimulation. Remarkably, across overall immune cells, we see a pattern of reduced responsiveness to TLR7/8 simulation in simulated microgravity to most of the highest genes induced at 1G (Supplementary Fig. 13A), with T cells and NK cells showing the most reduced inflammatory gene induction. T cells, NK cells, and overall across all cells exhibited blunting of induction of numerous genes in interferon signaling, and gbp genes in simulated microgravity in response to TLR7/8 agonist. Interestingly, monocytes tended to maintain such responses better in simulated microgravity, consistent with their predisposition to some inflammatory pathways in simulated microgravity. Some chemokines, such as ccl3, ccl4, ccl8, and cxcl10 appeared to be induced better in simulated uG across overall immune cell populations, though monocytes actually showed reduced induction of some of these chemokines, likely due to their capacity to produce them in simulated microgravity without stimulation (Fig. 1D). Nonetheless, the overall effects in sensitivity to stimulation in the “overall” category of immune cells largely followed the same pattern seen in the total magnitude of response of stimulated microgravity vs stimulated 1G (Fig. 3D).",

First, we repeated experiments in a validation cohort of freshly isolated PBMCs from young donors (n = 6, age range 20–46), and spun these PBMCs for 25 hours, prior to performing bulk RNA-seq analysis. Using CIBERSORTx, we first mapped predicted changes in population frequency and were able to confirm increased CD14+ monocyte frequencies in simulated microgravity, consistent with our single-cell data (Supplementary Fig. 15, Supplementary Data 11). Between validation samples spun in simulated microgravity vs 1G controls, we identified 2149 genes differentially expressed (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Data 12). Despite the variability of data inherent to bulk RNA-seq of different populations of cells between donors, we still saw a highly significant correlation in normalized gene counts per specific gene between datasets both at 1G and in simulated microgravity (Fig. 5B). Moreover, we identified overlap in over 28% of our core signature genes (same directionality) across all immune cells from our single-cell analysis (106/375 = 28.3%) (Fig. 5C). Many of the overlapping genes induced were consistent with our most robustly altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared overlapping genes induced in acute immune responses (such as s100a8, s100a12, thbs1, il1b), chemokines (like cxcl8), heat-shock proteins (hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspb1), autophagy (atg7) and the actin cytoskeleton (rhou). Overlapping reduced genes in simulated microgravity, like in our single-cell datasets, included interferon response (stat1, irf1) and associated guanylate binding proteins (gbp1, gbp2, gbp4, gbp5), and cold shock genes (rbm3), amongst others. Overall, there was a highly significant enrichment and over representation of our core single-cell DEGs across our bulk validation cohort by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5C).",

While multiple stressors exist in LEO, the proximity to Earth and the presence of the Earth’s magnetic field negates some effects of galactic cosmic rays, especially at the altitude of the ISS. Thus, microgravity plays an important role in driving phenotypic changes in LEO. To accomplish this goal, we first mined data from NASA’s GeneLab database for its largest study looking at a major immune organ, the spleen, in mice flown on the ISS. The GLDS-420 study provides data from the spleens of ten mice housed on the ISS for 33 days compared to ten ground controls. Though this cohort represents longer exposure to microgravity than our single-cell data’s more acute exposure, any overlapping genes could represent persistent microgravity-sensitive immune cell genes across longer duration exposure. From the GLDS-420 dataset, we identified 1448 significant DEGs (Fig. 5D), of which 50/375 (13.3%) overlapped in the same direction as our single-cell core list (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, many of the overlapping genes were represented as part of altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared induced overlapping genes in acute immune responses or complement (such as c3), autophagy (atg7), heat-shock responses (hsp90ab1, hsp90aa1, hspa1a, hspa1), and the cytoskeleton (dynll1). Overlapping reduced genes included interferon response (stat1), and again, cold shock genes (cirbp, rbm3), amongst others. Overall, we saw a significant enrichment in our core single-cell DEGs across mouse spleens flown in space by Fisher’s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig. 5E). Pathway analysis with IPA was next performed to identify major canonical pathways altered across all four complete datasets (single-cell unstimulated, single-cell stimulated with TLR7/8 agonist, Bulk RNA-seq validation unstimulated, and GLDS-420), including overlapping pathways shared across all datasets. These pathways are displayed in a heat map for comparison (see below), and will be described at that point.",

The I4 mission provides a compelling comparison since crew members spent up to three days in LEO, a timeline not too different from our 25-hour time point. Moreover, I4 gene lists were also generated by single-cell sequencing, making it a comparable technology for our analysis. However, it is important to note that the I4 datasets contain a few important caveats. First, the altitude flown by I4 crew (585 km/364miles) predispose the astronauts to higher radiation exposures than what would typically be experienced on the ISS (408 km/254miles altitude). Additionally, the I4 datasets were derived from PBMC gene expression comparisons between post-flight (1 day after Return/R + 1 in our case) vs preflight (44 days before launch/L-44 in our case). Since the changes from the I4 single-cell data represent changes encompassing effects of spaceflight, plus return to the ground, including short-term exposures to hyper-gravity, and one day of return to 1 g gravity (all which manifest as increased gravity exposure to inflight conditions), we considered overlapping immune cell genes in either direction on return to be gravity sensitive genes. Remarkably, despite these caveats, we found a very robust overlap of nearly 60% of DEGs in PBMCs in simulated microgravity (210/375 = 56%) to be also significantly altered across all immune cells in the I4 mission (Fig. 5F, Supplementary Data 13). Of these significantly altered genes across I4 data, 122 were altered in the same direction as I4 data, and 88 in the opposite direction. To gain a better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms impacted by gravity and spaceflight in the immune system, we compared pathways between simulated microgravity and the entire I4 dataset (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14, and Supplementary Fig. 16A). While we consider all of these pathways to be potentially gravity sensitive, we considered pathways altered in the opposite directions to be potentially acutely sensitive to gravity, while those pathways altered in the same direction likely take longer to normalize from a microgravity environment upon return.",

Interestingly, the return to gravity seen in the I4 mission reversed reductions in natural killer cell signaling and reversed pathways linked to poor adaptive immunity like IL-15 signaling, suggesting these pathways may be sensitive to acute changes in gravity (Fig. 5G, Supplementary Data 14). From the I4 dataset, we also noticed a consistent reduction in ribosomal subunit genes in the I4 data (Fig. 5F), which might be reflective of a stress response and reduced protein translation upon return to earth), and only some of these genes were reduced in simulated microgravity. Consistently, there was a marked reduction in EIF2 signaling in the provided I4 DEGs. Across all pathways, regardless of direction, we noticed many pathways pertaining to the cytoskeleton or to a mechanical extracellular environment (e.g., fibrosis, RAC, Rho family GTPases, RHOA, integrin signaling, leukocyte extravasation signaling, healing signaling etc.) to be altered by simulated microgravity or by spaceflight on immune cells.",

For the JAXA mission, we had access to cell-free RNA data, which can sometimes give insight into changes to PBMCs, amongst other cells. During this mission, blood was sampled from 6 astronauts, with data pooled into a single count, at days 5, 30, 60, 120 post launch. Given that cell-free RNA is not a fully ideal comparison to RNA-seq from isolated PBMCs, we focused only on the two early time points, 5 days and 30 days post launch, because we saw significant overlap between our single-cell data in both the three-day I4 mission and in the 33-day GLDS-420 dataset. Thus, we compared 5 days and 30 days in-flight vs preflight differentially altered cell free RNA signatures for any possible overlap with our single-cell data in simulated microgravity. While we did not observe much overlap in our core 375 immune gene signature at 5 days (less than 10 genes), we did see significant overlap by 30 days (42/375 = 11.2% overlap in the same direction) (Supplementary Fig. 16B). Interestingly, it was observed that cell-free RNA levels generally decreased across most genes in flight. Consequently, we hypothesized that identifying genes exhibiting increased expression could be particularly important for identifying over-represented processes. Remarkably, we did note that the most significantly elevated gene at 30 days in-flight vs preflight was cdc42, a key modulator of the cytoskeleton, as well as dynll1 a dynein gene that was also upregulated in our single-cell analysis.",

The Twins study provides intriguing data on the impact of LEO on the immune system, but has caveats in that exposure to LEO was calculated in only a single individual through bulk RNA-seq, and at multiple time points across one full year in space, a different duration than our shorter gene sets. Nonetheless, compared to our reclustered CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ gene sets, we found significant overlap in some genes comparing the effects of simulated microgravity to spaceflight (Supplementary Fig. 17A–C). Across multiple cell types, we saw changes in genes involved in redox regulation (e.g., reduced txnip), and in genes involved in interferon responses (e.g., reduced stat1 and gbp5). Interestingly, we saw significantly reduced cold shock gene, cirbp, a similar functioning gene to rbm3, in B cells in space. In our lymphocyte depleted (i.e., myeloid) recluster, we saw a large and highly significant overlap of about 163 genes with the Twins lymphocyte-depleted bulk RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig. 17D). Many of the overlapping genes induced by simulated microgravity or spaceflight included genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation (e.g., il1b, s100a12, thbs1 etc.), the cytoskeleton (rhoq, rhou), and hypoxia signaling (e.g., hif1α). Some interesting downregulated genes in both datasets in myeloid cells included again gbp5, cirbp, txnip like seen in T and B cells from the Twins study. We also noted a number of overlapping downregulated genes in antigen presentation (e.g., tap1, tap2, hla-e, hla-dp1a, etc). IPA analysis on this data largely captured the increases in innate immune inflammatory pathways, including increases in fibrosis signaling, IL-6 signaling, acute phase response, cytokine storm, and HIF1α signaling seen across some of our previous datasets (Supplementary Fig. 17E, Supplementary Data 16). Overall, these data enforce the idea of classically activated basal myeloid inflammatory changes in microgravity and spaceflight.",

Interestingly, while 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter mean cell area across PBMCs, it did alter actin granularity parameters, as well as intensity and variance, consistent with cytoskeletal changes in acute simulated microgravity (Fig. 6A–C), though these differences are mostly subtle to the naked eye. Using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging, 25 hours of simulated microgravity did not alter cell or nucleus volume, or nucleus shape, but it increased mean cell surface area and actin spike length, and decreased sphericity of the cells across PBMCs (Fig. 6A, B, D, Supplementary Fig. 18A, B). Remarkably, 1G immune cells and simulated microgravity immune cells demonstrate unique spectral changes to actin rearrangement post TLR stimulation, such that TLR stimulation resulted in a different pattern of actin granularity spectral change in 1G compared to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Fig. 6C). The effect of microgravity on the cytoskeleton in unstimulated immune cells was similar to the effect of TLR activation in 1G. During TLR stimulation in simulated microgravity, immune cells followed a unique dynamic actin rearrangement pattern, potentially even reversing the pattern observed in 1G with TLR stimulation. These results suggest that simulated microgravity itself may induce immune cytoskeleton alterations, which may mimic aspects of TLR ligation on the cytoskeleton. Short-term exposure to simulated microgravity showed some increases in the mitochondrial MitoTracker Red staining intensity and variance in the unstimulated conditions, without changes to fiber length, size, or volume (Supplementary Fig. 18C).",

Active GTP-Rac1 was not altered at baseline in simulated microgravity, though showed a trend to induction with TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Levels of active GTP-RhoA were low in our samples, but trended lower in simulated microgravity without stimulation, and higher under stimulation, analogous to our single-cell data predictions (Supplementary Fig. 18D, E). Overall, these data suggest that simulated microgravity changes some Rho GTPase activity consistent with our transcriptional data, though ultimate impacts on cytoskeleton shape, variance, and dynamics likely involve additional contributing factors, including possibly other Rho GTPase family members not assessed.",

Consistent with our single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data, simulated microgravity was associated with increased or trending increases in mainly innate/monocyte immune cell-derived inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, CCL4), coupled to a reduction in cytokines that associate with T cell activation or proliferation (e.g., IL-2, IL-7, IL-15). Concurrently, the Luminex results showed a significant IFNγ and a trending IFNα2 reduction upon TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity, consistent with our above ELISA data (Fig. 6F). IL-1, commonly induced in our sequencing data, also appeared elevated in simulated microgravity, though it exhibited high variability, precluding significance in the unstimulated state. In the stimulated state, IL-1β was significantly increased in simulated microgravity by Luminex analysis. Given the overlapping similarities between cytokines in the Luminex data and sequencing data for IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, we further assessed these cytokines by ELISA validation. Both IL-6 and IL-8 showed significant or near-significant increases by ELISA in simulated microgravity, while IL-1β demonstrated a trending increase (Fig. 6G, Supplementary Fig. 19E).

Consistent with Luminex and ELISA data, we saw increased IL-1β production across all characterized monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21A, B). Interestingly, despite no overall differences in IL-6 by Luminex or ELISA in simulated microgravity to TLR7/8 stimulation, we still detected significant increases in a subset of monocytes only, as well as in NK cells (Supplementary Fig. 21C, E). Despite increased cytokine production, we did not detect increases in the activation marker, HLA-DR, in monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig. 21D). NK cells also showed a reduction in the proportion producing IFNγ, as well as reduced proportions of expression in the activation marker, CD69, and degranulation marker, LAMP-1, consistent with reduced functionality and response to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig. 21F, G). T cell subsets were less altered, though we still detected near significant or significant reductions in the proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ central memory T cells expressing activation marker, CD69, and in effector memory CD4+ T cells expressing proliferation marker, Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 21H). Taken together with our ELISA and Luminex data, these findings demonstrate that simulated microgravity, alone or in the presence of TLR7/8 agonist, can functionally alter cytokine production across immune cells. In general, consistent with sequencing data, the features demonstrate monocyte inflammatory function coupled to impaired T cell and NK cell functionality in simulated microgravity. Thus, changes in cytokine signaling observed in simulated microgravity may occur at least in part to changes in upstream cytokine production.",

Of note, Rho GTPases have been implicated in response to simulated microgravity in other cell types, but this connection is understudied in immune cells. Across most datasets, we saw changes to Rho GTPase signaling, including individually in RAC, RHOA, or CDC42 signaling, or combined in a global “regulation of actin-based motility by Rho” pathway in IPA. While we did notice some variability between our initial unstimulated vs stimulated single-cell data in these pathways, these pathways tended to show reduced RHOA signaling without stimulation, coupled with increased RAC signaling, analogous to what we observed from the I4 crew members upon landing. The JAXA6 dataset also demonstrated cdc42 to be the most significantly induced cell-free transcript in astronauts after 30 days in space. Pathways strongly linked to cytoskeletal remodeling, such as leukocyte extravasation, were also typically induced in most of our datasets. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity.",

Indeed, danger-sensing molecules like TLRs utilize Rho GTPases to facilitate IFN responses, or antiviral sensors can directly modulate actin rearrangement. One example is the PKR antiviral response, which was consistently downregulated by simulated microgravity in our datasets. In this system, PKR binds gelsolin to enforce basal innate immune defense, though upon viral sensing, PKR dissociates from gelsolin, leading to the severing of actin, and activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)s signaling and interferon response. Other antiviral sensors like RIG-I directly bind F-actin in resting cells, and then relocalize to the mitochondria via actin rearrangements on viral infection, to induce type 1 IFN. In single-cell data, reduced interferon signaling without stimulation was seen mainly in monocytes, linking it to innate immunity, though with TLR7/8 stimulation, reduced interferon signaling was seen across many cells, including most T cell subsets, and NK cells, displaying the broad importance of this pathway across most immune cells to microgravity. In simulated microgravity, we saw reduced IFNα production by ELISA with stimulation, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced IFN signaling seen in simulated microgravity starts with reduced capacity for IFN production in some conditions, in addition to potential defects in downstream signaling itself. While we have focused on type 1 IFN signaling, some reduced interferon responses are also linked to reduced signaling from the IFN gamma receptor (IFNGR). Consistently, we also noted reduced IFNγ production in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Whether the cytoskeleton is needed for IFNGR clustering and signaling remains to be seen.",

            "text": "Another pathway found consistently down across datasets included LXR signaling. Interestingly, LXR signaling also can promote antimicrobial defense mechanisms. Macrophage LXR has been shown to reduce bacterial infection by reducing intracellular NAD+ in a CD38 manner, with mechanistic impacts on the cytoskeleton. Whether NAD+ levels fall in microgravity remains to be seen, though we did see an interesting increase in sirtuin signaling across datasets, including in the I4 mission. Sirtuins may be functioning to counter acute oxidative stress in microgravity. We also saw reduced oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional signatures across all unstimulated immune cells in simulated microgravity. Altered metabolite levels (and possibly ROS) from impaired oxidative phosphorylation might also contribute to HIF1α stabilization as observed in some of our simulated microgravity and spaceflight datasets. Reduced oxidative phosphorylation can be associated with increased glycolysis in immune cells, fueling “M1-like” pro-inflammatory changes in macrophages, potentiating NF-κb signaling, acute responses and IL-6 or IL-1 release, cytokines frequently induced in microgravity. Consistently, we did notice a preferential enrichment of predicted “macrophage classical activation” signatures across our gene sets in the Twins study.",

Heat-shock expression may be reflective of altered proteostasis in simulated microgravity, and may be required for adaptation to mechanical unloading in some cells, though this may also be linked to higher temperatures. Across all gene sets, we noticed a reduction in the cold shock gene, rbm3, which was reduced in nearly all immune cells in our single-cell data. Increased heat-shock coupled with reduced cold shock genes raises the possibility of higher intracellular temperatures directly induced by microgravity, but whether microgravity, or associated increase in cytokines or binding partners such as IL-1ra, directly induce the observed “space fever” in astronauts requires further insight. Interestingly, we did notice a number of significant IL-1 ligands in innate cell to T cell interactions in our microgravity Interactome, highlighting the possible importance of this cytokine family and downstream interacting molecules.",

While analysis of our datasets cannot rule out this possibility, we did not observe increased Th2 signatures across our simulated microgravity systems, or with our specific gene sets validated across the I4 mission. We also saw inconsistent changes to IL-23 and IL-17 signaling across our datasets, though these cytokines are known contributors to skin disease. While the root causes of such lesions cannot be inferred from our data analysis, it likely involves changes in the crosstalk with the skin microbiome, in addition to intrinsic immune cell abnormalities. Interestingly, we did see reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling in most of our datasets, especially in CD14 monocytes and conventional type 2 dendritic cells, raising the idea of reduced AHR signaling in space to contribute to skin lesions. However, we saw AHR signaling was enriched in the Twins study gene set result and so more experimentation is needed to tease out a possible role for the AHR in astronaut skin lesions.",

This algorithm focuses on the strength of interaction and does not specify direction. However, we tested one of the most significantly interacting compounds, the flavonol, quercetin, for its ability to reverse transcriptional changes to simulated microgravity on the immune system, and found that it could reverse approximately 70% of altered core genes. Of note, quercetin reversed numerous pathways, including core pathways such as reduced nuclear receptor activation, sirtuin signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, associated acute phase responses and IL-6 signaling. Quercetin also showed impact on the cytoskeleton, favoring a freezing of pathways linked to its mobility in microgravity, by reducing genes associated with Rho GTPase signaling (e.g., reducing RAC, RHOA and CDC42 signaling), and boosting RHOGDI signaling. Despite these changes, quercetin was unable to revert the core immunosuppression pathway of reduced interferon responses. However, since actin skeleton mobility is needed to induce an IFN response in many instances, too much interference could contribute to a persistent lack of IFN signaling here, and might represent a further mechanism of immune suppression mediated by quercetin that requires more study. Interestingly, after 25 hours in simulated microgravity, we saw variable results on the induction of senescence pathways, though quercetin markedly reduced senescence associated transcripts in our data. Thus, while quercetin acts in part through its senotherapeutic mechanisms, the large breadth of additional other pathways suggests multiple beneficial modes of activity for immune modulation in microgravity.",

Recent work in other cells, such as endothelial cells, has identified cytoskeletal abnormalities as a key feature of simulated microgravity that drives autophagy and a reduction in mitochondrial mass after 72 hours of exposure. Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells.

Another related important avenue of future research is to better understand how changes to force action on immune cells link to the mitochondria dysfunction hallmark of spaceflight and metabolic alterations, and to map such changes to immune cell metabolism as has been done to other mechanical forces. Moreover, the immune system in spaceflight is also under the influence of changing pressure gradients, such as increased pressures in parts of the upper body, coupled to lower central venous pressure and potentially altered shear force. These changes may also contribute to altered immune function, including the increased IL-1 and IL-6, two cytokines sensitive to external force cues, seen in spaceflight, with potential for intersecting signaling nodes across mechanotransduction and other pathways such as mitochondrial dysfunction within immune cells. More work is needed to understand how these additional changes in force impact innate and adaptive immunity during spaceflight and how they interact with the effects of microgravity.",

As well, integrating more in-depth chromatin and analytical approaches, such as ATAC-seq, can help detail the regulatory changes that might be underlying these immune phenotypes. Overall, our current work provides a resource to better understand “astroimmunology”, in particular how and why the immune system changes in simulated microgravity and spaceflight.

Cellpose 2.0 with the “cyto2” neural network was used for finding cells in the images based on nuclear and actin staining. Protruding actin bundles were analyzed by first binarizing projection images of actin using the trainable LABKIT segmentation, and this was followed by separation of protrusions and measurement of their maximal distance from the bulk of the cell using morphological erosion and distance image functions in Image Analyst MKII. Rescaled projection images were saved and further analyzed in CellProfiler 4.2.4, where images were segmented for nuclei and these segments were extended to the cell boundaries based on the phalloidin staining. These profiles were used for measuring shape, granularity spectrum, and texture in actin, mitochondria, and nuclei. For actin granularity spectrum measurement the following parameters were used in CellProfiler MeasureGranularity function: “Subsampling factor for granularity measurements” = 1, “Subsampling factor for background reduction = 0.125”, “Radius of structuring element” = 12, “Range of granular spectrum”  = 16. Similar results were obtained using a set of discrete Fourier transformation-based Butterworth bandpass filters in Image Analyst MKII for analysis of actin granularity spectrum changes in simulated microgravity and TLR stimulation. Here a series of 16 adjacent 4-pixels wide (in Fourier space of a 512 × 512 pixels image), 300-order bandpass filters with “Corrected Integral” normalization and absolute value calculation were used starting at 1 pixel, and mean pixel intensities over whole cells in the filtered images were normalized to the unfiltered image. We have previously shown that this technique is primarily sensitive to sub-resolution changes in thickness of underlying filamentous structures, such as actin bundles in this case. We found no changes in granularity spectra measured by CellProfiler or Image Analyst MKII when analyzing mitochondria or nuclei of the same cells, excluding optical biases.",
