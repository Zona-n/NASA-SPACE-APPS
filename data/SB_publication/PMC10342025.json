The elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria and Nox2, coupled with impairment of stress protection (e.g., SIRT1, antioxidant enzymes), contribute to atrophy. We tested the hypothesis that the SIRT1 activator, SRT2104 would rescue unloading-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function in rat gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were evaluated under three conditions (10 days): ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded (HU), and hindlimb-unloaded-treated with SRT2104 (SIRT). Oxidative phosphorylation, electron transfer capacities, H2O2 production, and oxidative and antioxidant enzymes were quantified using high-resolution respirometry and colorimetry. In the gastrocnemius, (1) integrative (per mg tissue) proton LEAK was lesser in SIRT than in HU or CON; (2) intrinsic (relative to citrate synthase) maximal noncoupled electron transfer capacity (ECI+II) was lesser, while complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to ECI+II was greater in HU than CON; (3) the contribution of LEAK to ECI+II was greatest, but cytochrome c oxidase activity was lowest in HU. In both muscles, H2O2 production and concentration was greatest in SIRT, as was gastrocnemius superoxide dismutase activity. In the soleus, H2O2 concentration was greater in HU compared to CON. These results indicate that SRT2104 preserves mitochondrial function in unloaded skeletal muscle, suggesting its potential to support healthy muscle cells in microgravity by promoting necessary energy production in mitochondria.",

            "text": "Disuse and mechanical unloading that occur during spaceflight can result in detrimental skeletal muscle atrophy and defects in mitochondrial structure, metabolism, and function. Specifically, spaceflight and microgravity result in decreased muscle fiber size and altered activity of several metabolic enzymes in the soleus and tibialis muscles. Within fast-twitch fibers, space flight decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity in the subsarcolemmal region, while slow-twitch fibers experienced altered distribution of succinate dehydrogenase activity across the entire fiber. Additionally, simulated microgravity increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in multiple cell types and elevated pro-inflammatory signaling. Sources of ROS that have been demonstrated to contribute to unloading-induced muscle atrophy include the mitochondria and NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2). Indeed, mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to skeletal muscle wasting with denervation, unloading, and cachexia.",

            "text": "Thus, there is a glaring need for preventative measures to maintain skeletal muscle health in astronauts enduring microgravity during their journeys to space. Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that respond to alterations in mechanical loading. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and insufficient levels of stress proteins are proposed cellular mechanisms by which unloading causes pathology and impairment in musculoskeletal function. Mitochondrial ROS also appears to contribute to unloading-induced atrophy. Mitochondria have many essential cellular roles, including mitochondria’s well known, essential function in energy production. Oxidative energy production in mitochondria is accomplished through enzymatic pathways in the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC). Oxidative enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), as well as substrate flux through the ETC, are important markers of metabolism adversely affected by unloading and spaceflight. In addition, ROS production by electron leakage from the ETC can contribute to elevated oxidative stress during unloading. Thus, there is current thought that preservation of mitochondrial function and prevention of ROS leakage could mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy that occurs during spaceflight and disuse.",

            "text": "Recent evidence has suggested that a pathway involving AMP kinase (AMPK) and siruitin-1 (SIRT1) can be instrumental not only in mitochondrial biogenesis, but also in the preservation of skeletal muscle mass. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase that influences the activity of several enzymes and transcriptional regulators. SIRT1 mediates responses to inflammatory, metabolic, and oxidative stressors. Specifically, SIRT1 moderates mitochondrial biogenesis through deacetylation of the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α). Previous studies have identified several beneficial effects of SIRT1 activation on musculoskeletal and systemic health via pharmacological treatments, including improved endurance. SIRT1 is also involved in skeletal muscle repair and resveratrol’s anti-atrophic effects in aging skeletal muscle occur via SIRT1. Loss of SIRT1 appears to play a role in food depravation-induced muscle atrophy. However, the potential mitigating role of SIRT1 in unloading-induced mitochondrial function and muscle atrophy is poorly understood.",

For example, SIRT1 attenuated age-induced loss of muscle mass in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. In addition, SRT2104 treatment reduced pro-inflammatory mediators and elevated PGC-1α during hindlimb unloading in old mice. Together, these results suggest SRT2104 could improve mitochondrial function and protect against muscle wasting. However, the impact of SRT2104 on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and ROS production has not been determined with mechanical unloading. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that SRT2104 would rescue mechanical unloading-induced impairments in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, modulate redox responses, and protect skeletal muscle (e.g., soleus, gastrocnemius) mass. Fischer-344 rats were divided into the following conditions: ambulatory control (CON), hindlimb unloaded for 10 days (HU), and hindlimb unloaded for 10 days while treated with SRT2104 (SIRT).",

However, rats treated with SRT2104, while undergoing hindlimb unloading did not experience the same deficit in maximal electron transfer capacity as those just hindlimb unloaded. Additionally, hindlimb-unloaded rats also had a lesser contribution of complex I-supported oxidative phosphorylation to maximal electron transfer than control rats and SRT2104-treated rats. Complex I is suggested to be the predominant source of ROS compared to the other complexes of the electron transfer system. Interestingly, hindlimb-unloaded rats had a greater contribution of LEAK to maximal electron transfer compared to control and SIRT rats. A greater relative proton leak may be an attempted protective mechanism to mitigate elevated ROS concentrations observed in hindlimb-unloaded rats. High oxidative stress and ROS production may induce greater proton leak, generating a positive feedback loop between ROS and proton leak. However, proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane results in a decrease in the proton gradient that is generated by the electron transfer system and less protons being utilized in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production for cellular energy. This may suggest that a greater proton leak also signifies less efficient energy production in hindlimb unloaded rats.",

Unexpectedly, rats treated with SRT2104 had greater H2O2 production and concentration in both the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. Conversely to hindlimb unloaded rats, SRT2104-treated rats had lower integrative LEAK than both control and hindlimb-unloaded rats. This may indicate that SRT2104-treated rats did not experience the same protective proton leak as hindlimb-unloaded rats. However, in previous research, the levels of the antioxidant enzyme SOD2 increased in the muscles of SRT2104-treated mice. This is potentially an adaptive response to mitigate ROS-induced cellular damage, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. The current study noted greater general SOD activity in rats that were hindlimb-unloaded only and in rats treated with SRT2104 during hindlimb unloading. While increasing SOD activity may be a mechanism to combat unloading-induced ROS production, increased SOD without a compensatory increase in catalase or GPx would permit increased levels of H2O2. However, GPx activity was not different with either treatment. Given that SOD converts the toxic superoxide (O2.−) to less toxic H2O2, while GPx eliminates H2O2 into nontoxic H2O and O2, the ramification of trading of O2.− for H2O2 is unresolved in unloaded skeletal muscle. Further, the effect of SRT2014 on cellular glutathione levels that could buffer H2O2 are unknown. Importantly, the current study did not investigate the influence of SIRT activation on Nox2, another predominant source of ROS that we have reported contributes directly to unlading induced atrophy.

Previous research indicated that H2O2 production in the soleus muscle of mice which were immobilized for 14 days was over 10 pmol·min−1·mg−1 compared to control mice at around 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1. In the current study, despite greater H2O2 production within rats treated with SRT2104 compared to control rats, production did not exceed 5 pmol·min−1·mg−1 protein; thus, it may be possible that this elevation in H2O2 production was not significant enough to perpetuate oxidative damage. Additionally, in the current study, mitochondrial capacities in rats treated with SRT2104 were similar to control rats, while hindlimb-unloaded rats exhibited several differences in mitochondrial functionality. This may suggest that, despite elevated ROS production, SRT2104 preserved mitochondrial capacities during hindlimb unloading, potentially due to protective antioxidant mechanisms.",

Previous investigations have reported reduced cross-sectional area, a dramatic decrease in total protein, and a decrease in total succinate dehydrogenase activity (activity × cross-sectional area) of both slow- and fast-twitch fibers in the soleus muscle following spaceflight and microgravity. However, succinate dehydrogenase activity decreased in concert with decreased fiber size. Since the mitochondrial measures in the current study were normalized to tissue weight, protein content, or citrate synthase activity, it is possible that mitochondrial measures decreased proportionally with muscle mass. As such, this could be why there were no significant differences in the mitochondrial measures of the soleus after normalization. In support of this, the current study identified that, within the right soleus, muscle mass was lowest in hindlimb-unloaded rats and greatest in control rats. While, within the left soleus, there was no difference in muscle mass of rats treated with SRT2104 and control rats, but the mass of hindlimb-unloaded rats was lower than both groups.",

Additionally, changes in mitochondrial morphology and expression of mitochondrial fission genes play a role in mitochondrial dysfunction and AMPK activation, perpetuating muscle wasting. Intrinsic mitochondrial function and maximal electron transfer capacity were lower in the gastrocnemius of hindlimb-unloaded rats than either SRT2104-treated rats or control rats, which might have contributed to depressed muscle mass in hindlimb-unloaded rats.

Muscle homogenates were subjected to a first centrifugation step (800× g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was again centrifuged (12,000× g, 10 min, 4 °C). The final pellet (isolated mitochondria) was resuspended in 150 µL MIM, and protein quantification was assessed using the Coomasie Bradford Protein assay (Thermo Scientific).

For SOD, an 80-fold dilution of the homogenate diluted 1:5 in provided sample buffer was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate with an intra-assay CV of 4%. One unit of SOD activity was defined as the amount of enzyme needed to exhibit 50% dismutation of the superoxide radical. For GPx, a 40-fold dilution of the homogenate was analyzed in triplicate on a single plate, with an intra-assay CV of 3%.
