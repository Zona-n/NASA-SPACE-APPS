            "text": "During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T, isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T, isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.",

Yeasts and yeast-like fungi isolated from Antarctic environments (proposed as resembling the surface and conditions of Mars and/or Icy Moons) were reported to successfully resist a wide spectrum of stressors which mimic conditions on other planetary bodies, including ionizing radiation, UV-flux irradiation, extremely low and high temperatures, desiccation, high salinity and acidic conditions (Onofri et al.; Selbmann et al.; Pacelli et al.; Buzzini et al.).

However, the presence of fungi in these cleanrooms has also recently been assessed, since fungi are tolerant of a wide range of extreme conditions (Parker et al.; Blachowicz et al.; Chander et al.). Characterization of fungi (including yeast) is important both for assessing the risk of forward contamination and updating appropriate cleaning and sterilization strategies (Benardini and Moissl-Eichinger). Therefore, newly discovered fungal (including yeasts) species in cleanrooms must be evaluated not only for their morphology, but also at the genomic level so that new countermeasures can be developed to eradicate them based on their biology and resilient properties (Chander et al.).",

It has been shown that yeast and yeast-like fungi are capable of adapting to and colonizing various ecological niches due to their genetic and phenotypic plasticity and robustness (Ene et al.; Ribeiro et al.). Several important adaptations facilitate survival of yeast cells in harsh environments, including production of thick external polysaccharide capsules, forming biofilm, and UV protective compounds, melanin, carotenoids and mycosporines (Buzzini et al.). In this study, we describe for the first time two novel yeast species from NASA cleanrooms, which are oligotrophic extreme environments.",

Phylogenies based on 16S ribosomal RNA or average nucleotide identity (ANI) are most commonly used for prokaryote taxonomy, but fungal species are identified with nucleotide sequences of multiple conserved gene regions (Lücking et al.). To identify yeasts, both phenotypic traits and molecular analyses are required (Boekhout et al.). The modern yeast taxonomy includes genealogical approaches based on single locus (ITS or LSU), multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) and recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Libkind et al.; Boekhout et al.; Chander et al.). Molecular phylogeny for species recognition in Fungi is gaining broad attention (Lücking et al.), but understanding species ecology requires investigating morphology, physiology, and biochemistry leading to the Consolidated Species Concept based on the so-called polyphasic approach (Boekhout et al.).",

Library preparation was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol (Illumina document # 1000000025416 v07). The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5–12 cycles of PCR amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex configuration with dual-index adapters. WGS was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 base pairs (bp) platform with a paired-end module. The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 (Patel and Jain), for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The genomes for the two novel yeast species were reassembled using the Automatic Assembly For The Fungi (AAFTF v 0.3.3) pipeline (Stajich and Palmer), as follows: (i)The Illumina sequencing reads underwent trimming via the BBDuk module within the BBMap software suite (v 38.95) (BBMap: A Fast, Accurate, Splice-Aware Aligner (Conference) OSTI.GOV); (ii) BBMap was employed to eliminate any contaminant reads, and (iii) the resulting high-quality reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.4 (Bankevich et al.). (iv) Contaminant contigs were identified and removed, using nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn) (Johnson et al.); (v) We purged duplicated contigs using minimap2 (Li). Final assemblies were polished, using the Pilon v1.24 software (Walker et al.); (vii) The final scaffolds were sorted by length and the fasta headers renamed for further annotation.

Weighted consensus gene structure was obtained via EVidenceModeler (Haas et al.) using weigh = 2 in the case of Augustus HiQ models and weight = 1 otherwise. Genes of length < 50aa and genes identified as transposable elements were filtered out of the dataset. tRNAscan-SE was used to predict tRNAs (Chan and Lowe). Finally, the funannotate annotate function was used to annotate genes using Eggnog (Huerta-Cepas et al.), Pfam (Mistry et al.), carbohydrate-degrading enzymes (CAZYme) (Drula et al.), Interproscan (Blum et al.), Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Gene Ontology Consortium), MEROPS (Rawlings et al.), and Secreted proteins (Choi et al.). Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the two yeast genomes via fungiSMASH, the fungal-genome-specific version of antiSMASH (Blin et al.). We next run the funannotate compare function in 7 Naganishia species (which ones) and in 5 Cystobasidium (which ones), to look for genomic trends of the above protein categories in those two groups of fungi. Next, we ran CAFE5 to infer changes in the size of Interpro gene families regarding their phylogenetic distribution using the gene birth and death procedure to infer gene gain and loss of specific yeast phenotypes. Assembled genomes and its respectively annotations were deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; Chander et al.).",

            "text": "Following recent multi-gene analyses of basidiomycetous yeasts (Liu et al.; Wang et al.), MLSA was used to obtain solid placement of the two yeast strains. The gene sequences of all available Naganishia strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for N. tulchinskyi (Bijlani et al.) and FJI-L2-BK-P3T strains, which were obtained from using blast tools (Additional file 1: Table S1). Likewise, the gene sequence of all available Cystobasidium strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for the FKI-L6-BK-PAB1T strain, which was obtained from its WGS during this study (Additional file 1: Table S2). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB, and TEF1) with all available Naganishia (n = 20) and Cystobasidium species (n = 21). The individual gene sequences for Cystobasidium and Naganishia datasets were aligned separately using the R package DECIPHER (Wright). Briefly, sequences from a fasta file were extracted and loaded using ReadDNAStringSet function. The removeGaps argument was set to \"all\" to remove all gaps in the input sequences. For this reason, OrientNucleotides function was used to reorient sequences by changing their directionality and/or complementarity to match specified reference sequences in the same set. By default, the first sequence with maximum width was used as a reference sequence. Character string indicating the allowed reorientation of non-reference sequences was set to \"both\" (for reverse complement). The algorithm works by finding the k-mer distance between the reference sequence. The more the sequences look similar, smaller is the evolutionary distance. Numeric threshold giving the decrease in k-mer distance required to adopt the alternative orientation was set to 0.05. AlignSeqs function was performed for the generation of the alignment. The profile-to-profile method aligns a sequence set by merging profiles along a guide tree until all the input sequences are aligned. Guide tree was automatically constructed based on a distance matrix of shared k-mers using the setting guideTree = NULL. iterations = 2 and refinement = 1 were set to specify the number of iteration steps to regenerate the guide tree based and the re-alignment. Thus, the best alignment was chosen based on its sum-of-pairs score. Construction of phylogenetic trees utilizing the seven gene sequences listed above for MLSA was performed via IQ-TREE v 2.1.1 using the concatenation approach (Minh et al.). ModelFinder approach was used for the evaluation of the best DNA substitution model (Kalyaanamoorthy et al.). Ultrafast bootstraps and SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) were assumed for branch support (Anisimova et al.). The tree topologies were then visualized with the Interactive Tree Of Life v5 (https://itol.embl.de/).",

The protein models representing the Tremellomycetes class (for phylogenomic analysis of FJI-L2-BK-P3T) and the Cystobasidiales order (for phylogenomic analysis of FJI-L2-BK-P3T) were downloaded from the Mycocosm portal (Grigoriev et al.). Additional unannotated genomes representing the Cystobasidium and Naganishia species were downloaded from NCBI and submitted to the same gene prediction papiline described above (See Genome Annotation and Comparative Genomic Analyses section). We used the hmmsearch tool from HMMER v3.3.2, to compare protein sequences to the fungi_odb10 database, a collection of benchmarking protein sequences that are conserved across a wide range of fungal species, and identify potential homologous sequences (Simão et al.). The tool utilizes a statistical model of protein sequence conservation to identify the degree of similarity between the query sequence and the protein sequences contained in the database. To create the protein alignments, the HMMER v3.3.2 hmmbuild function was employed. Spurious positions were purged with the ClipKIT v 1.3.0 tool, using the smartgap function. We then generated individual protein Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees employing IQ-TREE2 using partitions from each protein marker; the best protein model was calculated individually utilizing standard model selection (-m TEST option) (Kalyaanamoorthy et al.). Tree reconstruction was performed with the supermatrix approach (Chernomor et al.) and branch fidelity was tested using SH-aLRT (Anisimova and Gascuel) and ultrafast bootstrap methods (Hoang et al.).

Cell suspensions were diluted in molecular grade sterile water (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and ∼ 2 × 104 cells/mL were added to precision-cleaned aluminum coupons followed by drying overnight at room temperature in a bio-hood (Chander et al.). Coupons with dried yeast cells were placed in plastic Petri dishes, without a lid, and exposed to UV-C using a Crosslinker CL-1000 (UVP Inc). The lamp was placed above the sample with an exposure time required to produce the following doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/m2. The dose rate was 100 μW cm−2. After exposure to UV-C, 100 μL of 10% sterile polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was applied on each coupon and dried at 37 °C for 60 min. Dried PVA along with yeast cells was peeled using sterile forceps and added to 1 mL of molecular grade sterile water. The PVA extraction step was repeated twice. Once PVA was dissolved, serial dilutions were prepared and plated on PDA in quadruplicates. Colony forming units (CFUs) were counted after 7 days of incubation at 25 °C.",

ITS sequence similarity of the strain FJI-L2-BK-P3T with the majority of Naganishia species was > 98.5% suggesting that the ITS marker alone may not be useful to identify Naganishia species (see also Scorzetti et al.; Fonseca et al.). Furthermore, combined sequence analyses of both ITS and LSU fragments placed N. kalamii in the N. albida clade, in a distinct position next to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T (two substitutions in the LSU). Although the N. albida clade is represented in the literature, collections and databases by an array of strains showing highly variable physiological and biochemical characteristics, the pair-wise distances matrix clearly shows the difficulties to discriminate the members of N. albida clade when only ITS and LSU markers were used (Additional file 2: Fig. S2). This problem was highlighted in the comments to the species by Fonseca et al., but in 2021 two Naganishia species were described largely based on sequence dissimilarity in the clade (Kachalkin et al.; Tan et al.). However, it is important to note that the analyzed protein-coding (CYTB, TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2) individual phylogenetic trees of gene fragments other than SSU (invariable for the whole clade), LSU and ITS exhibited higher resolution in differentiating the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. S3–S7). Furthermore, seven-loci phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2a) convincingly showed that FJI-L2-BK-P3T occupies a distinct position in the clade with high bootstrap support (100%). The novel species N. kalamii is most closely related to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T, N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926T (type of Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. albida CBS 142T, N. liquefaciens CBS 968T and N. adeliensis CBS 8351T (Fig. 2a). Another species N. nivalis was not included in the MLSA-analysis because protein-coding sequences were not available for the analysis. The tree based on conserved genes from the N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3T genome (Fig. 2b) showed that N. kalamii is phylogenetically distinct from N. albida var. albida CBS 142T and Naganishia sp.

            "text": "The identification of yeasts has been shifted from phenotypic characterization to sequence-based identification and DNA-markers were utilized for defining their phylogenetic affiliation (Fonseca et al.; Scorzetti et al.). Since the 2000s, Naganishia species have been identified by considering differences among ribosomal gene sequences (ITS and partial LSU), which sometimes leads to ambiguous identification in subsequent revisions of the genus (Turchetti et al.; Ruiz and Radwan). Circumscription of the species Cryptococcus albidus has a long and complicated history of splitting and lumping using the ever-growing array of available tests and tools, including whole-cell protein patterns, DNA-DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequencing (Fonseca et al.). The species has long been known as a variable species and included, as varieties, yeasts that are presently placed in other genera and families of Filobasidiales (Fonseca et al.; Liu et al.). As the result of reclassification of the C. albidus species complex using LSU and later ITS sequences, many previous varieties were promoted to the taxonomic level of species, e.g. Naganishia diffluens, N. globosa, N. liquefaciens, Solicoccozyma terrea, Solicoccozyma terricola. Delineation of species using a single ribosomal gene region is not always reliable in basidiomycetous yeasts, because different lineages strongly vary in their rates of nucleotide substitution (Fell et al.; Scorzetti et al.). The case of the genus Naganishia is challenging as species were delimited based on very few substitutions in the two fragments, ITS and LSU. Based on ITS and LSU, the albida clade of the genus Naganishia currently include three varieties of N. albida (N. albida var. albida CBS 142T, N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926T (formerly Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810T) and three other species (N. nivalis DBVPG 5706T, N. liquefaciens CBS 968T, N. brisbanensis BRIP 28244; Additional file 2: Fig. S1; Scorzetti et al.; Kurtzman et al.; Li et al.). However, according to our results, combined sequence analysis of the LSU and ITS sequences, it is not possible to differentiate members of N. albida clade using the approach due to low discriminatory power and lack of bootstrap support (Additional file 2: Fig. S1). Our results suggest that the recently described N. brisbanensis (Tan et al.) might be a taxonomic synonym of Cryptococcus kuetzingii, the species that have not been included in the original analysis by Tan et al.. To improve as much as possible poor species resolution in the ITS-LSU tree, a seven-loci (MLSA) and WGS-based phylogenies were generated for the discrimination of N. albida clade members. The MLSA tree convincingly separated N. kalamii from the other members of the N. albida clade suggesting that it should be placed in a new species rather than keeping as a N. albida variety which would further increasing the heterogeneity of the species. Furthermore, our MLSA- and WGS-based trees suggest that all the varieties of the N. albida clade are likely to be independent species (Fig. 2a). However, the complete reclassification of N. albida must include (either as the seven-gene dataset, but preferably WGS) recently described N. nivalis and N. brisbanensis, the varieties N. albida var. kuetzingii and N. albida var. ovalis, as well as some present synonyms of the N. albida, namely Torulopsis rotundata and Torulopsis nadaensis (Fonseca et al.). In addition, WGS-based phylogeny of the strains NY-1402, N6, and I2-R1 from public databases revealed that strain NY-1402 is potentially a novel species and two other strains (N6, isolated from deep-sea sediment and I2-R1, isolated from an ISS HEPA filter for a rodent experiment) should be assigned to N. tulchinskyi. These examples show that MLSA and WGS analyses are necessary to avoid misidentification (Taylor and Fisher; Liu et al.; Wang et al.; Vu et al.).",

All the psychrophilic or psychrotolerant Naganishia species exhibit the presence of cold-adapted genes which might have allowed them to colonize cold environments such as Antarctica and the deep sea (Selbmann et al.; Turchetti et al.; Fotedar et al.; Han et al.; Segal-Kischinevzky et al.). N. qatarensis, a halophilic yeast isolated from a warm hypersaline marine environment in Qatar, is reported to grow at 30–35 °C (Fotedar et al.). Growth of N. qatarensis at lower temperature (~ 25 °C) has been reported but it took 8 weeks after incubation. Conversely, N. kalamii is able to grow in a temperature range of 15–35 °C after 7 days, and growth was noticed within 14 days when incubated at 4–10 °C. Similar to Naganishia species, the C. onofrii clade consists of three species that were also isolated from cold environments (Tsuji et al.; de Menezes et al.) and other members of the genus Cystobasidium (n = 12 species) are among the most common cold-adapted species (Buzzini et al.). All members of the genus Cystobasidium, including C. onofrii, are psychrophilic or psychrotolerant, with optimum growth temperatures ranging from 15 to 20 °C.",

Cold-adapted yeast species are reported to survive while embedded in the ice layers of glaciers or in permafrost (Zucconi et al.; Turchetti et al.), finding micro-conditions that are isolated from the surrounding environments (Price). Low nutrient availability is another limiting factor typical of Antarctic ecosystems. The oligotrophic Antarctic yeast C. tubakii, which closely related to C. onofrii, does not require amino acids and vitamins for growth, and is also able to grow at − 3 °C (Tsuji). Since future space missions—for example, ESA JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA Europa Clipper missions—are designed to explore the potential habitability of icy moons, the presence of cold-adapted yeasts should be monitored in the NASA cleanrooms. For future missions, monitoring psychrophiles, xerophiles and halophiles in SAFs is of particular interest because they may be capable of surviving inside or under the icy crust of Europa due to its extremely cold and saline environment (Marion et al.). For instance, C. lysiniphilum and C. slooffiae are reported as halotolerant species (Mokhtarnejad et al.). Similarly, C. onofrii shows moderately halophilic aptitude since it exhibits growth at 10% NaCl.",

Our genomic analysis reveals that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species have predicted proteins (Pfam and Interpro terms) associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response. Halotolerance is another adaptation required for yeasts typically active in hyper-arid regions, and so the halophilic traits detected in the genomes of these species also likely contributes to their survival in the cleanroom environment (Buzzini and Margesin; Logan et al.; Yurkov et al.). As reported by Yurkov et al., members of both genera Naganishia and Cystobasidium (N. albida and C. minutum) were nearly the only yeasts isolated from hot and dry sandy soil of the Namib desert. N. albida is well-adapted to dry conditions due to a thick polysaccharides capsules, which might be responsible for its remarkable ability to survive in air-dried autoclaved loamy sand (Vishniac). Highly desiccation tolerance has also been reported in N. vishniacii, showing almost 100% survival after 27 days at a relative humidity of < 1% (Connell et al.). Another species of the genus, N. friedmannii tested for desiccation (along with stratospheric low pressure and temperature and UV exposure) during stratospheric balloon flights, recorded larger numbers of viable cells than bacterial spores. Presence of the genetic traits associated with desiccation and oligotrophy were present in N. kalamii and C. onofrii, promoting their presence to the stringent conditions found in cleanrooms. Our genomic analysis revealed that along with genes related to desiccation tolerance, genes related to UV resistance are present in both Naganishia and Cystobasidium members. However, the only strain exhibiting all gene ontology terms involved in UV resistance is N. vishniacii ANT03-052, firstly isolated from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), a terrestrial Mars analogue. We may assume that local physical–chemical parameters of the environment might be one of the evolutionary drivers that induce the stabilization of the genes required to survive in the extreme conditions (Aureli et al.).",

            "text": "UV-C resistance may be a critical factor for microbial survival during interplanetary transport. Most work correlates increased UV-C resistance with microbial pigmentation (Kreusch and Duarte). Few studies recognized the existence of non-pigmented yeasts with similar resistance (Moliné et al.; Schmidt et al.; Pulschen et al.; Kreusch and Duarte). Our results showed UV-C survival of the non-pigmented N. kalamii and the pigmented pink-colored C. onofrii at up to 3000 J/m2 UV-C irradiation. Multiple species from the non-pigmented Naganishia species are highly resistant organisms to UV radiation (Pulschen et al.; Schmidt et al.) and our results are in line with this finding. Indeed, we found that the polar yeast N. onofrii is more resistant to UV-C radiation compared to the pigmented C. onofrii, which is capable of synthesizing carotenoids with UV shielding properties (Moliné et al.). Furthermore, cold-adapted yeasts, such N. onofrii are characterized by a thick cell wall and the ability to produce an extracellular polysaccharide capsule surrounding their cells (Turchetti et al.), providing robustness to the organism when exposed to stress conditions. This adaptation is typically found in extremophiles. Indeed, it is already demonstrated that deinococcal polysaccharide capsule (DeinoPol) has antioxidant properties involved in resistance to severe environmental stresses, including UV radiation and hydroxyl radicals (Lin et al.). During atmospheric transportation, microorganisms must cope up with not only with intense UV, but also low temperatures and dehydration (Selbmann et al.).",

Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response were also present in all the Naganishia species analyzed. However, only the psychrophilic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 had genes involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691).

            "text": "By comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation in the different species analyzed, we identified that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species present a consistent number of genes related to a saprotrophic lifestyle of decaying organic and plant materials (PL36; GH5; CE10; GH128; AA1). Moreover, serine proteases S33 and S09X found in N. kalamii, are essential hydrolytic enzymes with several functions such as protein maturation, signal peptide cleavage and transduction, and intracellular protein turnover. Although both are typically understudied in yeast, they have been suggested as a marker for saprotrophy in fungi as they are theorized to be less expressed in fungi with a pathogenic or animal-associated lifestyle (Muszewska et al.). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the relatively high abundance of the aminopeptidases M01 and the serine proteases S12, which are both detected in abundance in the genome of N. kalamii, may be an indicator of saprotrophy (Muszewska et al.). The same trend has been detected in C. onofrii. Furthermore, genes encoding a wide range of glycosyl hydrolases that have the capacity to degrade the major plant cell wall polymers (eg. AA1 for lignin and GH5 for cellulose breakdown) were found in both N. kalamii and C. onofrii. Acetyl esterases, found in C. onofrii, are an important component of the enzymatic machinery for fungal degradation of plant biomass and break down xylan-derived oligosaccharides and on galactoglucomannan (Venegas et al.). In particular, the Acetyl esterases subfamily members are preproenzymes, acting in the lysosomal/endosomal system and may be involved in the external digestion of proteins in saprophytic organisms (Chan et al.). The synthesis of extracellular enzymes which degrade organic matter and release nutrients is crucial for the survival of saprotrophs. However, by comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation of the two yeasts described here, we observed a loss in gene family (PFAM terms and GO-term counts) in both species, which is usually associated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals. It is worth mentioning that the loss is more remarkable in N. kalamii (Muszewska et al.).",

            "text": "KV and NKS conceived and designed the experiments. FK coordinated in designing the sampling events. AMC supervised the standardization of experiments related to radiation/UV tolerance. KV and AMC designed and executed bright field microscopy experiments. PL, MT, JES, ACS, and NKS carried out phylogenetic analysis and alignment for positional description of organisms in the tree. AMC cultivated and incubated all strains for imaging and phenotypic characterization. PL, MT, and KV selected images and drafted descriptions. AY performed assimilation tests and provided support in the novel species descriptions. MT, JSE, ACS, and NKS analyzed the genomic data inclusive of de novo assemblies and verification, scaffold quality assessment and generated the draft assembly of the genomes. MT generated both WGS phylogenetic trees. AMC submitted genomes in NCBI. CM performed shotgun sequencing and sequence analysis using the NovaSeq platform. KV isolated the strain. PL wrote the first draft of the manuscript (Introduction, methods, results and discussion) and phylogenetic trees and figure generation. MT contributed to the final version of the manuscript. KV and ACS extensively edited the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
