While substantial study has been focused on understanding the biology and risks associated with prolonged exposure to microgravity and the hazards presented by radiation within and outside of low earth orbit (LEO), other hazards exist that can impair individual and team performance and well-being. These include the experience of isolation from social groups and networks in confined and extreme environments combined with lack of sleep quality and quantity with disrupted circadian cycles. NASA’s research portfolio which examines spaceflight hazards to astronaut health and performance heavily rely on ground-based analogues using rodent models, with most studies focusing on a single hazard. There are ethical and obvious health limitations in performing controlled experiments that examine radiation and/or microgravity effects in astronauts. Hence, the use of ground-based analogues to study spaceflight hazards have been useful in gaining insight into both mission-critical and post-mission effects of spaceflight environmental challenges on astronauts’ tissues, organs, systems, and functional performance. Astronaut health must be maintained in order to ensure success and quality of life as NASA directs resources to planned missions to the moon, Mars, and extended use of the International Space Station (ISS). The ultimate focus of this review is to describe physiologic outcomes from ground-based analogue models for microgravity and radiation, specifically highlighting the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing from rodent ground-based tail suspension via hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB) models, although in vitro and spaceflight results are discussed as appropriate and in comparison with HLU results. In addition, the limitations of the HLU model as a microgravity analogue, within and across systems will be discussed.",

Among musculoskeletal tissues that exhibit a dynamic response to loading, exposure to microgravity results in: muscle atrophy, loss of bone mineral density primarily at load-bearing skeletal elements (e.g., pelvis, femur, vertebrae), and increased risk of herniation of the intervertebral disks due to increased fluid volume. These negative effects also could be compounded by spinal muscle atrophy and affected spinal ligaments, ultimately leading to pain. Cardiovascular responses to microgravity include redistribution of blood cranially, increasing arterial pressure at the head and lowering pressure at the distal leg elements; though the response may be transient. This altered pressure gradient may contribute to spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome in which optic disk edema, optic globe flattening, thickening or folding of the choroid layer, ischemic regions of the retina, and hyperopic visual disturbance may occur. With these and other systems degraded with exposure to microgravity, as reviewed herein, ground-based analogues are essential for identifying and developing countermeasures. To this end, the rodent HLU model is a primary surrogate for “microgravity”.",

            "text": "The HLU model was originally created as a ground-based analogue for reduced weight-bearing on skeletal tissues in order to study musculoskeletal deficits caused by spaceflight. Briefly, the hind limbs are lifted off of the cage floor as the tail is tethered to a support bar within the cage. Many studies use traction tape to tether and lift the tail and hind limbs off the ground; however other methods for tail suspension exist, for instance pinning of the tail to a tether. The standard is to raise the tail so that the torso is at a 30° angle relative to the substrate to permit relatively normal forelimb loading, while decreasing load applied across the hind limbs. Bone and muscle atrophy unsurprisingly occur with the reduction in weight-bearing. This approach of tail suspension has been considered standard in part because it results in other physiologic responses analogous to the body’s response in microgravity, such as a cephalic fluid shift. Because of the ensuing fluid shift, reductions in weight-bearing and resulting cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations within and across systems, this approach has been widely adopted as a microgravity analogue compared to other disuse models of osteoporosis, such as neurectomy/nerve crush to induce degrees of paralysis, or limb immobilization models.",

The considerable ionization power of GCR ions makes them the primary antagonist for possible late effects to multiple physiologic systems. During spaceflight in interplanetary space, every cell nucleus will be traversed by a hydrogen ion or delta ray every few days, and by the heavier GCR ion every few months. Despite their relatively low frequency, the heavy ions contribute a significant amount to the GCR dose that astronauts will incur outside of LEO. Thicker shielding could provide protection but is limited by the capabilities of spacecraft launch systems. In fact, studies have shown that even if the amount of, e.g., aluminum, shielding is increased, there will not be a significant reduction of the intra-vehicular radiation dose. Astronauts currently on the International Space Station (ISS) are exposed to on average about 1 mSv/day, and even have emergency plans to shield themselves with water bags should an SPE occur. As we travel further outside of LEO, however, it is expected that this daily dose will increase by a factor of 2–3 with limited additional protective measures for SPEs due to spacecraft design and consumables.",

            "text": "While background GCR radiation is a concern, SPEs represent an immediate acute exposure of radiation dosage especially if they occur during extravehicular activity. SPEs can produce energetic particles at levels that are orders of magnitude higher than ambient exposures. SPEs consist of high-energy protons that emanate from the Sun from regions of magnetic instability. The ability to predict the occurrence or magnitude of future SPEs, and the likely doses received by exposed crew, are limited. The acute radiobiological effects of whole-body SPE exposures are not well understood. They are complicated by the inhomogeneous distribution of radiation doses to sensitive organs and difficulty with extrapolating animal model data to humans. Additionally, it is unknown how the human health response to SPEs will be affected by concurrent GCR exposure. Based on calculated exposures in the context above, even large SPEs are predicted to deliver doses of <0.5Gy-Eq to internal organs and skin doses of <2.5Gy, with rates of delivery peaking at a dose rate of approximately 0.12Gy-Eq/hr to blood-forming organs. For an SPE similar in magnitude to the 1972 event, an astronaut crew would incur an intra-vehicular skin dose roughly equal to NASA’s 1-year spaceflight radiation permissible exposure limit (3.0Gy-Eq/skin and 500mGy-Eq to blood forming organs. Additionally, the dose to blood-forming organs would approach the 1-year permissible exposure limit for these organs (0.5Gy-Eq).",

The rate of bone loss was found to be site-specific, with a 1.4–1.5% and 0.9% decrease in aBMD of the hip and spine respectively per month in the ISS. In the hip, the rate of loss was higher in cancellous bone (2.2–2.7%/month) compared to cortical bone (0.4–0.5%/month). In contrast, trabecular vBMD and mass decreased by 14.4–16.5 % throughout the mission duration. Bone strength in the proximal femur also was reduced as determined by finite element modeling for stance and fall loading.

As noted, because of the dynamic response of bone to loading, one of the advantages of using animal models, particularly from ground-based HLU, is that brisk bone loss can be achieved (within weeks to months) upon exposure to simulated microgravity and partial weight-bearing. The magnitude of bone loss achieved by HLU varies across studies which is unsurprising given differences in methodologies, duration and age at onset of HU, as well as sex and strain of animals used. Seven days of HLU in 17 week old male C57BL/6J mice led to ~15% decrease in % cancellous bone volume (BV/TV) in the proximal tibia. In female C57BL/6J mice, one month of HLU led to a 74% reduction in % bone volume in the proximal tibia. A 21 day HLU period in 12 week old male C57BL/6 mice led to decreases in BMD as measured at different sites along the femur. The magnitude of HLU-induced decreases in BMD ranged from 8–11% as measured from the proximal to distal end of the femur. The appendicular bones of humans and rodents have notable differences in anatomy and stance loading, in addition to dissimilarities in the timing and duration of postnatal skeletal growth. Hence, anticipating the magnitude of bone loss in humans from a rodent model for skeletal disuse is not straightforward. Nevertheless, the results from the HLU model are generally consistent with findings in humans that microgravity can accelerate bone loss.",

            "text": "Bone loss also has been examined in animal models for space radiation exposure. Historically, bone was considered radiation resistant, and thus the dose threshold for damage was assumed to be high. However, studies performed in the early portion of the 2000’s identified late bone loss in mice after 2 Gy exposures to multiple qualities of radiation (e.g., protons, iron ions, carbon ions, and photons), with the consideration that 2 Gy represented an appropriate comparative dose between clinical fractions and spaceflight exposures. Later studies typically made use of a lower reference dose of ionizing radiation (e.g. 1–2 Gy 137Cs), a single representative species of GCR or sequential exposure to two ion species. These spaceflight relevant studies identified that while osteoblast activity is lower after exposure (which historically was assumed to be the mediator of late bone damage after high dose exposure), osteoclast activity was increased as an early response, leading to acute bone loss. The dose threshold for bone loss after simulated spaceflight radiation was determined to be low, with mixed fragment doses <0.5 Sv (protons and helium ions) causing late bone (and muscle) damage, and individual doses of 0.5 Gy 56Fe and protons causing acute bone loss in mice. These investigations have thus confirmed that bone is a radiation sensitive tissue, with the outcome being loss of architecture and density. However, one study has reported that radiation can have positive effects on bone microarchitecture. Skeletally mature (16 week old) female mice exposed to 0.5 Gy 56Fe exhibited increased cancellous % bone volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th.) and trabecular number (Tb.N.) in the distal femur at 21 days post-irradiation. These results highlight that while radiation is generally considered disadvantageous, many questions remain regarding how low dose radiation could affect bone, including questions regarding bone material and mechanical properties that occur with alterations in architectural properties. These questions should be addressed in the context of complex, mixed beams of energetic particles to improve the model spaceflight-relevant radiation exposures. Recently, the NSRL has developed a GCR simulation involving a more complex combination of multiple ion species that approximates the anticipated exposure of crew based on current spacecraft design.",

            "text": "Published studies on the combined effects of microgravity and radiation on skeletal integrity differ in experiment designs, making comparison and validation of results across studies quite challenging. Despite the limited number of reports and heterogeneity in experiment designs, two major conclusions can be drawn from collective findings. Firstly, findings from animal models predict that bone loss due to microgravity and ionizing radiation exposure can be additive under certain conditions. Secondly, skeletal parameters may have differential sensitivities to combined spaceflight factors. In some studies that have used representative high linear energy transfer (LET) species in combination with HLU, additive effects were seen in a subset of skeletal structural parameters but not in biomechanical properties. For example, 16-week old, male C57BL/6J mice that underwent 14 days of HLU displayed decreased cancellous and cortical BV/TV in tibia versus normally loaded controls while similarly aged cohorts exposed to 50 cGy proton or 50 cGy proton + 10 cGy 16O did not show such decrements. Yet when HLU was combined with 50 cGy proton + 10 cGy 16O exposure, further decrements in BV/TV were observed. Biomechanical properties such as maximal force, measured by three-point bending, was negatively impacted by HLU but not by radiation. However, no further deficits were observed when HLU and radiation were combined. These findings are generally consistent with another report which made use of similarly aged female mice exposed to 100 cGy of protons in combination with four weeks of HLU. Combined microgravity and radiation also can lead to skeletal impairments at the cellular level. Skeletal homeostasis is achieved through the balance in the activity of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Exposure to 0.5 Gy 56Fe was found to exacerbate HLU-induced deficits in alkaline phosphatase activity of marrow-derived ex vivo osteoblast cultures, suggesting that microgravity in combination with radiation exposure can impair osteoblastogenesis. Additionally, two weeks of HLU combined with 1 Gy 56Fe delivered on Day 3 led to enhanced bone loss versus exposure to each single hazard. This study also identified potential mechanisms for bone loss in the hind limb from each challenge, related to endothelial dependent vasodilation of the feed arteries of the gastrocnemius. Specifically, it was identified that altered vasodilation associated with bone loss was mediated by altered nitric oxide (NO) synthase signaling, although occurring in divergent manners between hazards: with HLU, alterations occurred to reduced production and concentration of NO, and radiation-induced alterations were due to increased NO quenching.",

Most of the available data on the effects of radiation on the skeleton were generated from acute exposures. Published results from fractionated or sustained exposure models remain a rarity. One group has examined the effects of 0.5 Gy 28Si delivered as an acute dose or three fractionated doses of 0.17 Gy in combination with PWB at one sixth body weight. The PWB-induced decrements in both endocortical and periosteal % mineralizing surfaces of cortical bone sites appeared to be worsened by 28Si although standard deviations were wide, therefore necessitating additional confirmatory studies. In general, neither acute nor fractionated exposure exacerbated the effects of partial weight-bearing on femoral BV/TV and femoral neck biomechanical properties such as load to failure and stiffness. Others who have simultaneously applied continuous exposure to low dose rate photons (8.5cGy 137Cs) exhibited no radiation response, only bone loss due to HLU over the course of a 20 day study.",

Strides also have been made in identifying other promising candidate countermeasures for mitigating spaceflight-induced bone loss. Antioxidants are often considered as candidate countermeasures to protect against radiation and/or HLU-induced bone loss: as previously noted altered NO concentration (and expanded upon in Section 5; Cardiovascular Response) is associated with radiation and HLU, and biomarkers for oxidative stress in the marrow in another study has been identified to increase after radiation but not HLU, highlighting some inconsistencies in the literature. In a rodent model, pre-feeding with an antioxidant-rich dietary supplement (dried plum) prevented bone loss and decrements in bone strength resulting from HLU, ionizing radiation and in combination. These results suggest some shared mechanisms underlying microgravity and radiation-induced bone loss. However, while antioxidants such as dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) or an antioxidant cocktail have been shown to be less efficacious at reducing bone loss in mice early after 2 Gy gamma ray exposure, alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to reduce early bone loss after 2 Gy gamma rays. Collectively, these findings suggest that antioxidants have varying efficacies in preventing the negative effects of spaceflight stressors on bone. Future studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms for the protective effects of promising antioxidant-based countermeasures for spaceflight.",

In addition, standardization of methodologies and caging designs for conducting HLU and partial weight-bearing studies also are important to allow for comparison and interpretation of findings across studies and research groups. More mechanistic investigations also are needed to understand the molecular underpinnings of the skeletal response to combined spaceflight factors. Bioinformatics approaches that allow for the assessment of global changes at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels are particularly useful in identifying novel pathways that underlie the skeletal response to spaceflight. To date, omics data from skeletal tissue is rare.

While it is important to address remaining knowledge gaps on fracture risk in follow-up studies, investigations by the space research community also need to broaden to reflect our growing understanding of skeletal function. Beyond providing structural support, the skeleton is an endocrine organ that can crosstalk with other tissues to maintain health and homeostasis. A number of studies demonstrate the ability of bone to function as an endocrine organ (reviewed in to regulate a variety of physiological processes including glucose metabolism, appetite suppression, cognition and behavior. The organism’s ability to coordinate the function of multiple tissues via bone-derived factors is essential to keep up with the demands of daily living. For example, bone-derived lipocalin-2 (LCN2) regulates glucose homeostasis via endocrine action on major metabolic organs, and also can cross the blood-brain barrier to control appetite via its binding to the melanocortin receptor (MC4R) in the hypothalamus. In addition, LCN2 can exert pro-inflammatory actions on a variety of cell types including vascular cells. Osteocalcin (OCN), another bone-derived hormone can modulate cognition and anxiety-like behavior. Mice heterozygous for an OCN null allele showed deficits in cognition while administration of OCN improved memory and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. In addition, OCN has been shown to mediate aspects of the acute stress response. In the presence of stressors, it is thought that OCN participates in signaling to inhibit the parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system to allow the sympathetic pathway to predominate, in turn promoting flight or fight responses. The biological processes regulated by these bone-derived hormones are critical for human health and performance in space missions. Hence, it is important to begin to address whether combined spaceflight factors can perturb signaling mediated by bone-derived hormones. More studies also are needed to understand the role of bone crosstalk with other organs in mediating the physiological changes attributed to spaceflight.",

In the last decade, over 30% of astronauts flying long-duration ISS missions have presented with one or more of these ocular disturbances. Most recently, the NASA twin study found variations in choroidal and total retinal thickness, which was suggestive of retinal edema and choroidal folds in the twin exposed to spaceflight.

After long-duration spaceflight, morphological changes in the optic nerve and surrounding tissues have been reported. One study showed that even in transient microgravity conditions, as produced by parabolic flight, changes in retinal vasculature occur. Microgravity may also induce an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP). A more recent study reports that in astronauts, there is an acute increase in IOP upon entering weightlessness, but that it normalizes to ground-based levels after a few days of flight.

Attentional set shifting (ATSET) thus enables subjects to rapidly adapt and respond to changes in the environment, and to perceive what is important for survival or completion of a task, skills that are required to deal with a sudden emergency. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) has been widely used to assess task switching in humans, with task switching deficits being increased in patients with Parkinson’s disease and autism. The intra-dimensional (IDS)/extra-dimensional (EDS) set shifting task is a modification of WSCT that assesses set-shifting abilities in rodents.

Translating ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts remains an enormous challenge, but should similar neurocognitive impairments occur in astronauts exposed to low space radiation doses, a Numbers-Needed-to-Harm analysis (of the rodent data) predicts that ~30% of the astronauts could develop severe cognitive flexibility decrements.",

In an in vitro study, synergistic changes of reduction in neuronal network integrity and cell survival induced by simulated space radiation and microgravity were observed.

Two recent studies have established how inadequate/disturbed sleep alters the severity of space radiation-induced impairment of executive function. A single session of fragmented sleep uncovered latent ATSET performance deficits in rats exposed to both protracted neutron and Si irradiation that had no obvious defects in performance under rested wakefulness conditions. SF selectively impaired performance in the more complex set shifting stages of the ATSET test in the both neutron and Si irradiated rats. Set shifting performance has rarely been impacted by exposure in studies conducted with rats tested under rested wakefulness conditions. Thus, radiation-induced cognitive impairment may not be fully evident in normally rested rats, substantially underestimating the level of impairment that may occur when astronauts are on mission. Cognitive testing may thus have to be conducted under both rested wakefulness and SF conditions to get a more accurate assessment of radiation-induced neurocognitive impairment. Further ground-based studies on the impact of radiation on cognition in rodents that are under concomitant exposure to space flight stressors such as stress and social isolation are being initiated. Based upon the exacerbating effects of sleep reduction on the incidence, severity and type of cognitive impairments induced, it would seem likely that concomitant exposure to these other space flight stressors would result in similar “negative interactions”.",

The production of NO by the vascular endothelium through the NO synthase (eNOS) signaling pathway is a critical component for these vascular functions. Limited information is available regarding the effects of spaceflight on the vascular endothelium in humans. Lee et al.() reported that long-duration spaceflight in low Earth orbit elevated biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress and inflammation during flight, and these circulating biomarkers returned to preflight levels soon after landing. Despite the increase in systemic oxidative stress and inflammation, the astronauts showed no corresponding change in brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Although these results suggest that spaceflight-induced elevations in oxidative stress and inflammation do not adversely impact vascular endothelial function, it is important to note that the source of the circulating biomarkers is unknown and may originate from specific or unique portions of the circulation, such as the mesenteric vascular bed. Therefore, results obtained from large conduit arteries from non-weight bearing limbs may not be indicative of changes associated with specific vascular beds, including the coronary and cerebral circulations.",

Both 56Fe ion irradiation and HLU alone each impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, but this impairment was potentiated when the two treatments were combined. The endothelial dysfunction occurred primarily through the eNOS signaling pathway with 56Fe ion irradiation and HLU, but with 56Fe ion exposure the deficit was the apparent consequence of diminished anti-oxidant capacity and greater pro-oxidant protein expression in the artery, while with HLU the deficit in endothelium-dependent vasodilation was the apparent consequence of reduced eNOS protein content.

Adult stem cell populations are found in multiple physiological systems throughout the body and are surrounded by a highly organized and regulated microenvironment consisting of supporting cells and factors, resulting in the formation of a stem cell niche. Following injury, damage, or normal cell attrition, stem cells within the niche receive signals resulting in transition to an active state and initiation of the differentiation process. Therefore, in order for regeneration of damaged tissues to occur, resident stem cell pools must be activated and induced to differentiate into lineage specific cells. Such activation signals may be biochemical or mechanical in nature, and therefore may be affected by exposure to microgravity.

Whole-body blood cell counts after proton radiation confirm these findings indicating decreased amounts of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils up to 100 days post-irradiation. Additionally, HSCs may be affected through their corresponding microenvironment, influenced by adjacent irradiated cell populations through the bystander effect. Coculture experiments of unirradiated HSC and irradiated MSC mixtures show that HSC populations experience indirect effects of GCR/SEP radiation of MSCs along with the previously established direct effects resulting from HSC irradiation.

Neurogenesis is required for cognitive strength, mood regulation, and neurological stability, thereby stressing the importance of characterizing any cosmic radiation-induced effects on neural stem cells (NSCs). While both NSCs and proliferating neural progenitor cells were negatively affected by cosmic radiation, quiescent NSCs were found to be particularly vulnerable compared to their rapidly dividing progeny. This suggests that mechanisms unrelated to cellular replication may be impacted by GCR, such as oxidative stress, and implies long-term negative effects to stem cell populations and their differentiated progeny. HZE of GCR are shown to be directly associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production, causing damage and death of affected cells. NSCs in the hippocampal region may be especially susceptible to cosmic radiation-induced oxidative damage, attenuating neurogenesis and impairing cognitive function. Furthermore, murine cerebral exposure to heavy ion radiation with high linear energy transfer (high-LET) results in a premature aging phenotype through accelerated p21-mediated neuronal cell senescence. This phenomenon is also evident among other somatic stem cells, including endothelial progenitor cells, osteochondral progenitor cells, and lung progenitor cells.

It is possible that these tissue-based effects stem from aberrations in progenitor cell populations. Research conducted using gamma and heavy ion radiation demonstrated deficits in osteoblastogenesis due to increased oxidative stress in progenitor populations. Additionally, as previously noted in Section 2, combined exposure of mice to HLU and radiation demonstrated depletion of progenitor populations that were rescued by administration of an antioxidant rich diet, the dried plum diet.

Specific analysis of simulation devices is beyond the scope of this review; however, it is important to note that the utility of these devices to simulate microgravity is still debated, partially due to the question of whether individual mammalian cells have the ability to sense gravity, or whether they sense their mechanical environment (which is altered by gravity) instead.

In rats, HLU leads to many of the cardiovascular changes that occur in humans during spaceflight, including the cephalic fluid shift. HLU invokes many of the changes in blood vessel structure and region-specific changes in blood flow that are seen in rats during space flight and also results in changes in the ultrastructure of the choroid plexus and CSF production that closely resemble those seen in rats that have been in space flight. Factors such as altered neuroendocrine functions, behavioral deficits, and increased stress levels should be considered when designing studies and interpreting results. Stress is clearly a feature that astronauts will face during spaceflight), though astronauts typically have a high tolerance for stress. Porphyria, which is a sign of distress in laboratory rodents is a common, though transient, trait of rodents during HLU procedure. HLU models can increase stress response as indicated by elevated serum corticosterone that is associated with atrophy of lymphoid organs, although these responses are not always consistent. A primary technical report detailing aspects regarding HLU recommends housing single rodents at between 24.5C-25.5°C to mitigate any toxicity profiles (e.g., bone loss, impaired ability to thermoregulate). Moreover, based on experience of all of the authors, attrition of rats from HLU studies (e.g., sudden loss of rodents during the study, excessive porphyria, or persistent weight loss) occurs more frequently if housing is below this temperature range.",

As flight studies typically involve group housed mice vs single housed conditions, one group has performed a side by side comparison of HLU under single and socially-housed conditions. Results from this study reveal that deficits in skeletal structure typically attributed to HLU generally occur at a similar magnitude in single and socially-housed animals. This suggests that bone loss as observed in the HLU model results primarily from gravity-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, some immune system responses to HLU are differentially impacted by the social environment. Moreover, isolation impacts neural systems that mediate mission critical cognitive domains. For example, isolation has been observed to reduce makers of neuroplasticity in the rodent hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In addition, isolation has been observed to increase markers of neuroinflammation and cell loss in these brain structures, increases redox stress, proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) levels (in the hippocampus), and reduces Parvalbumin (PV)+ interneurons in CA2 and CA3.
