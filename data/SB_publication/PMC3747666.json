Within a 18wk period, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to one (1x-HLU), two (2x-HLU) or three (3x-HLU) cycles of 2 wk of hindlimb unloading (HLU) followed by 4 wk of reambulation (RA), or served as ambulatory age-matched controls. In vivo µCT longitudinally tracked changes in abdominal adipose and lean tissues, lumbar vertebral apparent volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area before and after the final HLU and RA cycle. Significant decreases in total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD were observed such that all unloaded animals reached similar values after the final unloading cycle. However, the magnitude of these losses diminished in mice undergoing their 2nd or 3rd HLU cycle. Irrespective of the number of HLU/RA cycles, total adipose tissue and vertebral vBMD recovered and were no different from age-matched controls after the final RA period. In contrast, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower than controls in all unloaded groups after the final RA period. These results suggest that tissues in the abdominal region are more resilient to multiple bouts of unloading and more amenable to recovery during reambulation than the peripheral musculoskeletal system.",

While body and muscle mass may return to normal values within several months upon return weight-bearing, weight-bearing bones may not recover even years after returning to normal ambulatory activities. Because of the limited number of space-missions and the invasive nature of many assays, many studies have turned to the well-established rodent hindlimb unloading model (HLU) to investigate the mechanisms by which a single unloading period causes atrophy. However, the impact of repeated exposures to microgravity on many physiologic systems, including the musculoskeleton and body composition, is largely unknown.",

During hindlimb unloading, body mass and serum leptin levels, linking energy metabolism to bone mass, can diminish even when caloric intake is adequate. Importantly, after 28 days of HLU, the change in bone formation rates was significantly correlated with the change in serum leptin levels. However, the loss of functional weightbearing also alters the mechanical milieu of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), the pluripotent precursors to numerous cell types including osteoblasts and adipocytes, which may bias the differentiation of MSCs from an osteogenic to an adipogenic lineage. Whether unloading-induced changes in MSC differentiation result in increased abdominal adipose tissue is not well understood.",

Bone receives mechanical input both from muscle forces as well as from ground reaction forces during gravitational impact. As ground reaction forces are removed during HLU, muscle activity provides the dominant source of mechanical cues. In contrast, ambulatory activities upon release from HLU engage both muscle and impact with the ground, perhaps disassociating muscle and bone recovery. While muscle-bone relations during disuse have been investigated in the hindlimbs, the extent by which muscle forces maintain vertebral bone is much less understood. And even though bone loss throughout the skeleton environment is site-specific in microgravity, it is largely unknown whether the response of the spine to HLU and reambulation (RA) is similar to peripheral skeletal sites.",

Nevertheless, the magnitude of bone loss diminished during the second and third unloading cycle. Whether these two phenomena observed in the appendicular skeleton extend to lumbar vertebrae, abdominal lean tissue volume, muscle cross-sectional area, and adipose tissue is unknown. Here, using new data collected during the previous experiment, we hypothesized that because of bone’s incomplete ability to recover during RA, multiple unloading cycles would be more detrimental than a single unloading cycle to lumbar apparent bone mineral density. We also hypothesized that previous exposures to unloading will attenuate the response of fat, muscle and bone to subsequent loading cycles. Further, based on associations between serum leptin and bone loss, we hypothesized a positive, linear relationship between bone loss and adipose tissue loss, as well as bone loss and muscle loss.",

To control for the potentially confounding effect of aging on the effects of previous unloading cycles on bone’s remodeling activity, the start of the first HLU/RA cycle was staggered so that for each group, the last cycle began at 28 wk of age. Therefore, 3x-HLU mice underwent unloading cycles at 16 wk, 22 wk, and 28 wk of age, 2x-HLU mice began HLU at 22 and 28 wk, while 1x-HLU mice began HLU at 28 wk. This approach also ensured that the RA duration was identical for all unloaded groups prior to sacrifice. At the conclusion of the 18 wk experimental protocol, all mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture and cervical dislocation (34 wk of age). The right soleus and gonadal fat pads were dissected and weighed, and the lumbar spine was extracted, wrapped in PBS-soaked gauze and stored at −20°C until later use.",

The in vivo vBMD assessment incorporated both cortical and trabecular bone in all five vertebrae. Thresholds were selected based on histograms of the gray-scale image to discriminate between adipose, lean tissue and bone. Lean tissue volume was comprised of muscles and organs, essentially the tissue remaining after subtraction of bone and adipose tissue. The Canny edge detection method was used to demarcate the abdominal muscular wall in order to separate SAT and VAT. At the same time points, the average upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area (MCSA, mm2) was also assessed in a 1.5 mm region of interest surrounding the distal femur in a scan performed with the same scan parameters but at 20.5 µm resolution.

We found that in male C57BL/6 mice, while the absolute tissue quantity reached during the final unloading cycle was similar regardless of the number of previous unloading cycles, previous exposure to unloading cycles attenuated the change in adipose, lean and bone tissue during the last unloading cycle. Despite considerable losses in both TAT and lumbar apparent vBMD during unloading, four weeks of reambulation were sufficient for complete normalization of these tissues to age-matched controls, irrespective of the number of unloading/reambulation cycles. In contrast, appendicular muscle cross-sectional area was significantly lower in all unloaded groups than in controls at the end of the last reambulation cycle. Further, there was a moderate association between the loss of bone and loss of abdominal adipose tissue, but no association was observed between the loss of abdominal lean tissue and loss of bone. These data demonstrate that diverse tissues can modulate their response to unloading based on their previous unloading history. They also indicate that a tissue’s susceptibility to sustain diminished volume after unloading/reloading cycles is specific to its identity.",

It is important to note that the lumbar spine is subject to a different mechanical loading environment than the femur during hindlimb unloading. In particular, hindlimb unloading imposes static loads on the spine, rather than habitual dynamic loads experienced during locomotion. Tail suspension at 30° subjects the tail to a tension of approximately 50% of body weight, although the precise loading distribution in a particular lumbar vertebra is unknown because the load is shared amongst ligaments, zygapophysial joints, muscle, the intervertebral disk, and bone. While static loads cause a very similar catabolic response to unloading, the difference in loading environment between the femur and abdominal/lumbar spine regions must be considered when interpreting the results of this study.",

Together, these data support the hypothesis that the lumbar vertebrae are more capable of recovering during reambulation periods than the peripheral skeleton. While this greater potential for recovery may, at least in part, stem from the lesser overall decline in vertebral bone volume compared to the peripheral sites, differences in the HLU induced mechanical environment between the lumbar spine and the femur may have played a role. In addition, the mechanosensitivity of the lumbar spine may indeed be greater as exercise studies have suggested. Further, differences in the resistance to the HLU stress induced actions of glucocorticoids may play a role between the different skeletal sites with the spine being able to more readily regain its morphology once the hormonal stress levels are removed.",

This relationship is opposite to previous data that identified skeletal trabecular sites with higher bone volume fraction as more prone to shedding tissue volume during disuse. The differential conclusions derived from our study, at least for bone, are likely associated with the previous exposure to unloading; if a tissue is subjected to unloading without having recovered from the previous exposure, its volume is not only diminished but its response to subsequent unloading bout will be attenuated. Whether this hypothesis holds true for the abdominal tissue of astronauts subjected to multiple bouts spaceflight is yet to be determined.",

Since visceral adipocytes are more metabolically active than subcutaneous adipocytes, weight-loss related changes in adipose tissue composition show a bias towards visceral fat loss, irrespective of whether the weight loss is associated with caloric restriction, exercise, or other interventions. While the biological roles of VAT and SAT may be different in humans than in rodents, SAT remained elevated in the 3x-HLU mice after the final reambulation period.

Hindlimb muscles that are composed primarily of slow-twitch fibers (e.g., soleus) undergo rapid atrophy in response to unloading but the effect of hindlimb unloading on the spinal muscles are much less well established. Our µCT based measurement technique of lean body mass in the abdomen included the abdominal organs as well as muscle and may therefore have lacked the required sensitivity to detect small changes in muscle volume. Following the reambulation period, relatively small differences in upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area (including the knee flexors and extensors) remained in unloaded groups but there were no inter-group differences in soleus mass. The greater degree of unloading in the hindlimb compared with the abdominal region, as well as the inclusion of internal organs in the measurement of abdominal lean mass may explain the discrepancy between the recovery of these tissues. While atrophy tends to be greater in the plantar flexors and knee extensors following space flight and bed rest, direct comparisons are difficult because of the different measurement techniques and more detailed analysis on changes in muscle biology and function during multiple unloading/reloading periods will provide further insight. Further, a longer reambulation period may allow recovery of muscle cross-sectional area as previous hindlimb unloading studies demonstrated that hindlimb muscle mass recovers in rats after 5 weeks of reambulation but not nine days.",

Indeed, none of the three protocols involving one, two, or three consecutive unloading/reambulation cycles altered body mass, TAT, or vertebral bone density to levels that were distinguishable from normal age-matched controls. Nevertheless, the attenuated response of tissues previously exposed to unloading suggests that previous experience influences subsequent exposure, perhaps due to reaching a basal level at which their volumes plateau. When combined with our results from the distal femur metaphysis, the differential ability of the lumbar vertebrae to recover from unloading induced bone loss is striking and may ultimately provide important cues towards the design of countermeasures that within the genetic constraints minimize bone loss and maximize recovery.",
