            "text": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, referred to as sarcopenia, is mitigated by lifelong calorie restriction as well as exercise. In aged skeletal muscle fibers there is compromised integrity of the cell membrane that may contribute to sarcopenia. The purpose of this study was to determine if lifelong mild (8%) caloric restriction (CR) and lifelong CR + voluntary wheel running (WR) could ameliorate disruption of membrane scaffolding and signaling proteins during the aging process, thus maintaining a favorable, healthy membrane environment in plantaris muscle fibers. Fischer-344 rats were divided into four groups: 24-month old adults fed ad libitum (OAL); 24-month old on 8% caloric restriction (OCR); 24 month old 8% caloric restriction + wheel running (OCRWR); 6-month old sedentary adults fed ad libitum (YAL) were used to determine age-related changes. Aging resulted in discontinuous membrane expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins: dystrophin and α-syntrophin. Older muscle also displayed decreased content of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a key DGC signaling protein. In contrast, OCR and OCRWR provided significant protection against age-related DGC disruption. In conjunction with the age-related decline in membrane DGC patency, key membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2) were significantly increased in the OAL plantaris. However, lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were effective at maintaining membrane repair proteins near YAL levels of. OAL fibers also displayed reduced protein content of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits (p67phox and p47phox), consistent with a perturbed sarcolemmal environment. Loss of Nox2 subunits was prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Our results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment.",

            "text": "Skeletal muscle is crucial for stability, mobility and whole body metabolism. As with all other organs, aging has a detrimental impact on skeletal muscle that can be observed phenotypically as atrophy, susceptibility to damage, fibrosis, and weakness. This age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function is often referred to as “sarcopenia.” Sarcopenia occurs in rodents and humans. In the human population sarcopenia affects up to 25% of humans that are 65 years and older, and greater than 40% of the population that is ≥ 80 years old. The affect that sarcopenia has on muscle function is clinically important, exemplified by increased susceptibility to muscle fatigue and weakness that lead to a higher risk of fall-related injuries. With mean lifespan continuing to increase, finding treatments and interventions to slow the process or lessen the impact of sarcopenia on health and quality of life are of critical importance.",

            "text": "The plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells, commonly referred to as the sarcolemma, relies on binding of the sarcolemmal scaffolding to the extracellular matrix (ECM) for proper membrane integrity. Sarcolemmal scaffolding is manifested as costameres, which are comprised of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) and integrin/focal adhesion complexes. Damage to the sarcolemmal environment can lead to a reduced ability to sense and respond to dynamic changes in mechanical stimuli. Indeed, impairment of sarcolemmal scaffolding and signaling promotes myofiber fragility and leads to overall muscle weakness and limited mobility. The sarcolemma is increasingly prone to mechanically-induced damage in aged muscle. Intriguing observations indicate that compromised integrity of the sarcolemma in conjunction with diminished mechano-signaling contributes to sarcopenia. For instance, in skeletal muscle from very old mice, sarcolemmal dystrophin becomes discontinuous and elicits decreased membrane integrity and lateral force transmission through the Z-disc to the extracellular matrix. These findings indicate that muscular dystrophic-like DGC disruptions occur in aging muscle.",

Mechanical and/or biochemical (e.g., lipid peroxidation) stressors can damage the sarcolemma and induce the membrane repair response. Shortly after the damage-inducing event, the membrane repair response occurs in a coordinated fashion, mitsugumin-53 (MG53) is recruited to the site of injury followed by dysferlin, annexin A6, and then annexins A1 and A2. While little is known about the relationship between sarcopenia and cell membrane repair, a similar repair response may be occurring in aged muscle as in the dystrophic muscles. Similar to the various forms of muscular dystrophy, aging is accompanied by increased levels of oxidative stress and susceptibility to damage – possibly triggering and contributing to the altered sarcolemmal environment.",

            "text": "Skeletal muscle wasting associated with aging is postulated to be due in part to increased levels of oxidative stress. In skeletal muscle, there are several oxidant producing sources, and while many studies have examined the role of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aging skeletal muscle, further examination of non-mitochondrial sources of superoxide is needed. NADPH oxidase (Nox) protein complexes have been found in skeletal muscle, with the Nox2 isoform serving as a major source of superoxide generation during contractile activity. In healthy muscle, contractile-induced activity of the membrane-localized Nox2 is crucial for redox signaling and upregulation of cytoprotective functions after cessation of contractions. However, in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Nox2 becomes hypersensitive to stretch while Nox2 abundance and activity are elevated, thus exacerbating disease pathology. Although recent Nox2 findings in aged skeletal muscle remain inconclusive, it is an intriguing possibility that alterations in Nox2 may contribute to the age-associated reduction in membrane integrity.",

We have previously demonstrated that lifelong wheel running and mild caloric restriction attenuated age-associated muscle fiber atrophy. However, the effects of lifelong caloric restriction and voluntary exercise on the sarcolemmal environment (i.e., DGC, membrane repair proteins, Nox2) are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate (i) the influence of aging on the sarcolemmal environment in the predominately fast-twitch plantaris muscle, and (ii) how lifelong mild (8%) CR and WR would affect the age-related affects. We hypothesized that aging would lead to a membrane environment that is indicative of reduced integrity and an exaggerated repair response that would be accompanied by increased Nox2 abundance.",

Rats were housed at the University of Florida’s Animal Care Services facilities until time of sacrifice at 6 (young) or 24 (old) months of age. A week after arriving at the University of Florida’s facilities, rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 6-month-old sedentary ad libitium (YAL; n = 12), 24-month-old sedentary ad libitium group (OAL; n = 12), 8% caloric restriction (CR) from 11 months-24 months (OCR; n = 12), and 8% CR plus voluntary wheel running (WR) from 11–24 months (OCRWR; n = 12). Studies have shown that rats fed an ad libitum diet have a tendency to run less, but mild CR (8–10%) is substantial enough to prevent the decline in running activity. Therefore, food intake for the two CR groups, OCR and OCRWR, was restricted by 8% below the ad libitum food intake of a separate group of sedentary, age-matched, male Fischer-344 rats that were housed in the same facilities. Although calories were reduced, nutritional balance was maintained for vitamins and trace minerals, as previously described. Throughout the length of the study, food intake in the OCR and OCRWR groups was adjusted weekly based on ad libitum food intake from the previous week. Animals were housed one per cage in a temperature-controlled (20° ± 2.5° C) and light-controlled (12:12 hour light-dark diurnal cycle) room. Sedentary rats were housed under standard conditions in rat cages purchased from Fisher Scientific. OCRWR rats were housed in standard cages equipped with Nalgene Activity Wheels purchased from Fisher Scientific. Activity wheels had a circumference of 1.08 m and were equipped with a magnetic switch and an LCD counter for recording the number of wheel revolutions. The number of revolutions was recorded for each animal on a daily basis. Body weights of all rats were recorded weekly.

Although the overall sarcolemmal content of dystrophin between YAL and OAL was not deemed significantly different, it was apparent that a discontinuous sarcolemmal pattern existed for the OAL fibers (Fig. 2A).

To examine this further, we investigated how aging as well as lifelong diet and exercise interventions, on membrane-repair machinery in aged muscle fibers. We chose to measure the protein content of four proteins that have been strongly tied to membrane repair processes: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2. Membrane damage is normally followed by a repair response to restore integrity to the membrane and maintain homeostasis. Our observations indicate that there is significant increase in MG53 (p < 0.0001), dysferlin (p < 0.0001), annexin A6 (p < 0.0001) and annexin A2 (p = 0.004) abundance in the OAL rats compared to YAL (Fig. 3). The lifelong intervention of CR+WR was capable of maintaining at or near control YAL levels of MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6, and annexin A2 (Fig. 3A and B). Plantaris muscles from OCR rats were found to contain significantly more dysferlin (p = 0.011) than OCRWR, but significantly less than OAL (p = 0.0005).

There was a trend for an age-related decrease (−45%) in the transmembrane catalytic subunit, gp91phox, comparing YAL to OAL (p=0.096; Fig. 4B). Regulatory cytosolic subunits, p47phox and p67phox, displayed a significant age-related reduction in protein content (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively; Fig. 4B). No significant difference was observed between YAL and OAL in the levels of the microtubule-associated Nox2 subunit Rac-1 (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, gp91phox, p67phox, and p47phox were expressed at significantly higher protein levels in the OCR compared to OAL plantaris (Fig. 4B).

Additionally, lifelong CR and CRWR offered protection against age-related alterations in the sarcolemmal environment, which may aid in maintenance of skeletal muscle functionality and overall health. We observed that sedentary aging led to discontinuous sarcolemmal patterning of key DGC proteins, such as dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS, an effect that was prevented by the addition of lifelong CR and CRWR. Inconsistent sarcolemmal patterning of DGC proteins is indicative of reduced membrane integrity; therefore, we examined proteins involved in membrane repair. Sedentary, ad libitum aging (OAL) had increased abundance of membrane repair proteins: MG53, dysferlin, annexin A6 and annexin A2. In order to elucidate the potential role of membrane-generated oxidative stress in the age-related reduction in membrane integrity, we sought to determine the role of the membrane-bound superoxide producing NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) complex. We identified several crucial Nox2 protein subunits that were significantly reduced with sedentary aging (OAL), which is prevented by lifelong CR and CRWR. Thus, our data indicates that sedentary, ad-libitum aging is associated with reduced sarcolemmal integrity, increased sarcolemmal damage, altered membrane redox environment, all of which are likely associated with the progression of sarcopenia. Lifelong CR and CRWR interventions were capable of mitigating the negative age-related alterations, consequently providing a myofiber environment conducive for better overall muscle health and function.

Very old rats (34–35 months of age) displayed impaired lateral transmission of force, there was a concomitant discontinuity in dystrophin. When coupled with the current data that illustrate a substantial disruption of DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOSµ), perturbations in DGC-ECM interface with aging could compromise myofiber structural integrity. For example, Rice et al. showed that aging led discontinuous positive staining on the sarcolemma for dystrophin, while membrane content increased in the EDL of 36 month old rats. Indeed, dystrophin was absent from discrete sections of sarcolemma similar to the plantaris muscles from the sedentary, ad-libitum aged (OAL) group. When a discontinuous and patchy membrane accumulation of dystrophin exists, there is a reduction in membrane and muscle fiber integrity. Bound to dystrophin, α-Syntrophin is a DGC protein that binds to and attaches nNOSµ to the DGC. We found a significant increase in total α-syntrophin in the OAL compared to YAL plantaris muscles (Fig. 2). Similar to the dystrophin data from Rice et al., an increase in α-syntrophin protein content was accompanied by discontinuous disruption of sarcolemmal α-syntrophin in the OAL group (Fig 2). Furthermore, mice lacking dystrophin are unable to localize α-syntrophin to the sarcolemma, consistent with shared poor linkages by costameres and lateral force generation. Membrane-associated α-syntrophin may also regulate protein turnover and remodeling, where the laminin – β-dystroglycan interaction permits sarcolemmal-localized α-syntrophin mediated phosphorylation of Akt.",

Here lifelong CRWR resulted in a non-significant (p = 0.08) increase of total nNOS compared to sedentary, ad-libitum aging, and was not impacted by aging. Sarcolemmal nNOS was drastically mislocalized in aged plantaris muscle fibers, where it was observed predominately in the sarcoplasm. Previously, our group and Suzuki et al. found that mechanical unloading and denervation cause translocation of nNOSµ away from the sarcolemma. Mislocalization of nNOS is also noted in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and other types of neuromuscular disorders, further emphasizing the physiological importance of the protein for proper muscle function to occur.",

Recent aging literature indicates that nNOS location, muscle, and physical activity have impacted age-related changes. We previously observed that constitutive NOS activity is reduced by aging. Overall nNOS protein levels were reduced in the soleus, but not the rat gastrocnemius. Pearson et al. did not find a reduction in total nNOS protein abundance from old C57Bl/6 mice. In contrast, Samengo et al., showed a 41% decline of nNOSµ expression levels in the quadricep muscles of 2 year old mice along with a concomitant decrease in protein content. In our study, CR and CRWR, proved to be effective at maintaining sarcolemmal nNOS compared to OAL fibers (Fig. 2). Previously, we found that exercise training increased nNOS protein expression in both muscles. Lieter et al. (2012) found that cytoplasmic localization of nNOS is greater in quadriceps of 19.5 month old mice vs. young mice, which could exacerbate proteolysis and atrophy. However, 6 weeks of administration of an NO-donor drug and 3 weeks of exercise in 18 month old mice prevented mislocalization of nNOS, concomitant with muscle hypertrophy. Consistently, loss of sarcolemmal nNOS was causal in skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area during disuse. The physiological importance of DGC localization of nNOSµ for healthy regulation of skeletal muscle size, damage, and repair is substantial. Therefore, lifelong CR and CRWR preserves a more continuous membrane patterning of key DGC proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, and nNOS), which could improve membrane and mechano-signaling, and protect against sarcopenia.",

Since the DGC offers stability to the sarcolemma, a weakened DGC could compromise sarcolemmal integrity and increase the risk of membrane leakage and fiber damage. Indeed, loss of sarcolemmal dystrophin results in muscle fibers that are more prone to contraction-induced injury, due to impaired ability of lateral force transference from the Z-disc through the costameres into the ECM. When dystrophin is lost, shear forces are elevated which can trigger ROS and Ca2+ mediated damage to the muscle fiber with repeated eccentric contractions. Compromised DGC leads to uncontrolled damage-repair cycling, fiber death, and eventual replacement with fibrotic tissue. Therefore, an intact plasma membrane environment and efficient repair of the cell membrane are crucial to maintenance of cellular homeostasis.",

Interestingly, CR alone was unable to maintain membrane repair proteins at YAL levels, particularly for annexin A6 (Fig. 3). Thus chronic exercise is required to better protect the environment of the aging sarcolemma. Indeed, we previously noted that lifelong wheel running plus mild CR abrogated age-related elevation of total hydroperoxides; while caloric restriction alone did not prevent age-related elevation of lipid hydroperoxides. Cagliani et al. observed annexin A1 and A2 levels were overexpressed in parallel in mdx mice, a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy characterized by high levels of membrane damage and lipid peroxidation.

Recently, Barrientos et al. found that p47phox displayed a non-significant downward trend with age (p=0.08), while Ryan and colleagues reported that total NADPH oxidase activity in the gastrocnemius was unaltered by age, following protein trends for the Nox4 isoform. Therefore, it is possible age-related changes in Nox2 expression may vary with subcellular localization, species, and independent of Nox4 protein expression. We postulate that the aging membrane environment may be unsuitable for normal response of Nox2 to contractions. Whereas lifelong physical activity may act to preserve normal Nox2 complex structure via maintaining a healthy membrane environmental phenotype. Here we found that lifelong wheel running maintained high abundance of gp91phox and p47phox (Fig. 4).

Due to a limited amount of tissue reserved for histochemical analysis, we were also unable to stain the plantaris muscles with IgG in an effort to examine tissue damage. These are unfortunate short-comings that should definitely be addressed in future studies in order to provide more details and connections as to the sarcolemmal integrity issues that appear to be occurring in aged animals. However, we were able to show that proteins that are normally associated with membrane repair were elevated in OAL muscle. Another drawback is that we only used male rats, leaving the question of potential sex-related differences unanswered. In addition, tissue mass and assay demands limited our ability to isolate and analyze mitochondrial ROS. Since the experimental design did not call for a lifelong WR only exercise group because 8% CR is needed to encourage voluntary lifelong wheel running activity, we were unable to differentiate the effects of WR from the effects of CR.
