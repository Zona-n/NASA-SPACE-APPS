The findings of spaceflight-based scRNA-seq and SRT investigations are likely to improve our understanding of life in space and our comprehension of gene expression in various cell systems and tissue dynamics. However, compared to their Earth-based counterparts, gene expression experiments conducted in spaceflight have not experienced the same pace of development. Out of the hundreds of spaceflight gene expression datasets available, only a few used scRNA-seq and SRT. In this perspective piece, we explore the growing importance of scRNA-seq and SRT in space biology and discuss the challenges and considerations relevant to robust experimental design to enable growth of these methods in the field.",

Recent advances in omics technologies have already revolutionized our approach to understanding disease and have created new pathways for tackling health challenges on Earth. However, the spaceflight environment presents a unique set of factors where the genomic impact is largely unknown. Furthermore, the microgravity and radiation environment of space remains difficult to model on Earth. Therefore, given that the opportunities to study the influence of spaceflight on the human genome have historically been, and still are, limited, it is of paramount importance to perform all omics experiments in spaceflight to the highest standards.",

Most mammalian omics studies aboard the ISS have used Mus musculus, the standard laboratory rodent, as a model organism. To scale the number of mammalian studies performed in space, NASA launched their rodent research (RR) program in 2014, with the first omics experiment published in the NASA funded GeneLab database in 2015. Since the program began, the RR program has launched over a dozen missions generating a steady stream of new omics data on a variety of murine tissues and cell systems. These missions have proven essential for understanding the molecular response of terrestrial life to the environmental stressors of space by providing gene expression data for a subset of mouse tissues. These studies have helped illuminate changes within biological systems including the mitochondria, musculoskeletal system, circadian rhythm, and microRNA (miRNA) profiles.",

Bulk transcriptomic assays are currently the most common omics assay performed in space biology, with more than 270 transcriptomic datasets available from spaceflight and spaceflight-analogue experiments in the NASA GeneLab database. Of these studies, microarray-based experiments have been used to obtain approximately half of the gene expression data stored in GeneLab. As the cost of next-generation sequencing (NGS) decreased, RNA-seq started to replace microarrays as the predominant method for spaceflight transcriptomic studies. However, given recent advances in the field of genomics, bulk RNA-seq is being displaced by higher-resolution methods rapidly on Earth. State-of-the-art tools can now resolve gene expression at the single-cell level via single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) or maintain 2D topography via spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). While these two types of approaches are becoming standard practice for gene expression research conducted on Earth, the collection protocols for cells and tissues obtained from experiments in spaceflight have not yet been optimized for the application of these methods.",

For example, large changes in gene expression have been observed in the murine retina, but the differences attributable to specific retinal subpopulations, such as rod photoreceptors, cone photoreceptors, retinal ganglion cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells, have yet to be pinpointed. Similarly, differences in immune function have been observed during spaceflight in the past, where the application of scRNA-seq would have enabled further dissection of specific gene expression differences in the cell populations of, for example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thymus tissue, and bone marrow. Overall, the possibility of identifying exact cell populations that are dysregulated during spaceflight enables the development of more precise therapeutics and countermeasures.",

In this experiment, a set of identical twins participated in a set of omics assays. One twin served as a ground control and remained on Earth while the other twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS. For scRNA-seq, whole blood was collected via venipuncture into cell processing tubes (CPTs) containing sodium citrate as a preservative (Figure 1B). The CPTs were returned immediately to the lab and centrifuged to collect PBMCs. The BD Biosciences Single-Cell Analysis System was used to collect single-cell expression data (Table 1). One important caveat to this study is that there was no in-flight time point, and blood was collected for scRNA-seq pre-launch and post-landing. The time it takes to return cargo, such as CPTs, to Earth is one of the factors limiting the ease of single-cell experiments. CPTs can be spun-down and frozen before returning to Earth, but this direct freezing process will lyse cells. With cell lysis, it is still possible to generate a sample-wide RNA-seq profile but not at single-cell resolution. To generate single-cell profiles from spaceflight samples, cells will need to be either returned to Earth immediately or cells will need to be preserved using a process that prevents lysis.",

Additionally, because of the requirement that tissues remain intact during the SRT workflow, these methods are also more sensitive to the tissue types and structures selected for study. This poses an extra challenge when SRT methods are to be applied to legacy space-flown samples that were collected and stored without planning SRT studies from the start of the missions and their morphology is not fully preserved. For these reasons, we believe improvements can be made in the tissue collection process to better preserve tissue morphology. Specifically, when designing future studies to be performed in spaceflight, where specimens will undergo SRT analysis, experiments should first be optimized on Earth before being translated to experiments performed in space. The overall testing cycle for SRT techniques can be divided into three phases: (1) tissue evaluation, (2) tissue preparation, and (3) 2D RNA analysis.",

It should be noted that most SRT methods to date have been validated with FF and FFPE tissues (Table 2). The third phase, 2D RNA analysis, will analyze the RNA spatial distribution in the tissue under study by applying one of the SRT methods available at the time of the experiment (Table 2).

Additionally, RNA that is not preserved rapidly is subject to degradation that can create distinct RNA-seq profiles, and different RNA transcripts can degrade at different rates. To account for this, samples intended for scRNA-seq must be preserved rapidly after euthanasia. If the experiment requires single-cell sequencing, the cells should be immediately placed in cryopreservation media and slowly brought to freezing temperature to ensure cells do not lyse during the freezing process. Additionally, tissues should be dissociated prior to freezing.

In this case, tissue samples can forgo cryopreservation media and should be brought down to freezing temperatures as quickly as possible, ideally snap-freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen if available. Comparisons of snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq in mouse lungs have shown that they have similar gene detection rates, and dissociation bias is reduced in snRNA-seq. Likewise, comparisons in kidneys showed similar gene detection rates. The recently completed Fly Cell Atlas utilized snRNA-seq instead of scRNA-seq because it can be applied consistently even in problematic tissue type (e.g., antennae, wings, fat bodies) and multinucleated cells (e.g., muscle) and because 70%–90% of transcriptomic information is retained with snRNA-seq. Moreover, nuclei can be applied as input for single-cell multiomics studies where both the RNA and chromatin accessibility information is captured from the same nucleus simultaneously.

This approach preserves both RNA quality and morphology of the tissue. Most of legacy tissues obtained from the ISS did not undergo immediate embedding and freezing for morphology preservation. In the majority of cases, individual organs were not dissected in-flight, but instead were frozen as a whole carcass on the ISS. These samples were returned to Earth where they were thawed, dissected, and re-frozen until ready for downstream sequencing approaches, mostly in bulk. Due to the necessity of organ dissection back in the laboratory on Earth, many rodent samples exposed to the space environment have undergone this double-freezing procedure. However, this process might lead to partial RNA degradation and deformation of cell and tissue anatomical shape if specific strategies for tissue morphology preservation were not taken into account at the time of freezing.

This study notes that whole-carcass preservation in RNAlater can better preserve the tissues; however, there are a few caveats to this approach. The first caveat is that RNAlater has only had limited success in preserving cells for scRNA-seq on Earth and will require further optimization before its application can be recommended for such experiments in spaceflight. The second consideration is that RNAlater can induce a unique gene expression response due to the sulfates present in the solution. These gene expression responses may be uneven in SRT methods due to the diffusion gradient generated as RNAlater disperses across a tissue. Third, RNAlater is not a fixative agent and has not been tested to our knowledge at the time of writing for compatibility with fixative reagents used in various SRT methods.",

Other reagents with a success in preserving cells and/or nucleic acids on the ISS include using NOTOXhisto, 10% neutral buffer formation (NBF), 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and the sequential use of trypsin followed by RNAprotect (Table 3). However, these preservatives are not necessarily suitable for scRNA-seq and SRT due to the lack of testing with scRNA-seq and SRT platforms or due to cell lysis that occurs during the preservation process. The current options with a track record on the ISS are the slow and fast freeze methods to store the tissue at a temperature that will preserve RNA and spatial tissue structure. −80°C freezers available on the ISS can be used to bring tissues down to freezing temperatures, but without a snap-freezing step, this process occurs slowly. To solve this problem, a rapid-freeze instrument was added to the ISS to rapidly bring sample temperatures down to −185°C, to compete with snap-freezing methods that make use of liquid nitrogen that is easily available and safely applied on Earth but not a safe option in a space-based lab (Table 3).",

In-flight tissue dissection will allow tissues of interest to be rapidly frozen, as smaller pieces of tissue freeze faster than a whole carcass, and will avoid the double freeze-thaw that tissues undergo if they are dissected from a frozen carcass back on Earth. The drawback to this approach is that tissue dissection is time-intensive and will require specialized crew training to teach dissection competency. Despite the time commitment required for in-flight dissection, it has been performed in select cases, such as hindlimb dissection during the RR-6 mission, though the data from this in-flight dissection are not publicly available. The second approach, LAR, returns organisms to Earth while still alive where they are euthanized after returning to a ground-based lab. This allows tissues to be preserved according to the highest standards but presents a different set of limitations. Using LAR, organisms have their circadian rhythms disrupted and experience the stressful conditions of atmospheric re-entry. Moreover, depending on the study design of the mission, LAR organisms have the opportunity to begin reacclimating to Earth’s gravity and radiation landscape. Therefore, all three aspects can impact their transcriptomic profiles.",

Some of these considerations may be met via use of the Microgravity Science Glovebox aboard the ISS to control airflow and by using benzalkonium chloride (BZK) wipes in place of alcohol-based disinfectants. Establishing and following general guidelines, regularly applied when preparing samples for scRNA-seq and SRT, will help create consistency in sample retrieval, prevent RNA degradation, and obtain high-quality data from spaceflight samples in which RNA quantity and quality are not compromised. One caveat to performing scRNA-seq and SRT methods in spaceflight is that it will require additional crew time to complete experiments that are typically done on Earth after sample return. Robotic automation can help overcome these challenges by reducing the amount of time that crew will need to spend executing experiments (Figure 2A). For example, automated imaging has already been performed aboard the ISS. Additionally, automation of library preparation steps has been performed on Earth from a spatially barcoded chip array similar to the 10X Genomics Visium format as well as from 10X Genomics Visium arrays. However, due to strict volume and mass limitations in-flight, compact solutions may need to be investigated, as would specific testing to accommodate microgravity-driven changes in fluidic behavior. Automating these processes and translating them to spaceflight-compatible hardware will alleviate potential time-costs placed on the crew by performing these experiments in-flight in their entirety.",

This processed data could then be downlinked to Earth instead of larger, raw files. Thus, onboard data processing could decrease delays in data analysis caused by the transfer of large files. Full transcriptomics analysis pipelines could even be conducted in space, where results, such as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways, could be automatically extracted from transcriptomic data in-flight (Figure 2A).

Integration across data types also gives these tools increased investigative potential. For example, integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, achieved with tools such as cell2location and stereoscope to name a few, can enhance spatial transcriptomics resolution to an unprecedented level. Moreover, integration of gene expression data with histology information and spatial location using machine learning (ML) is also under active research.

In data derived from spaceflight experiments, true morphological and transcriptional variability that results from exposure to microgravity and radiation should not be confused with artifacts created by sample collection, preservation, and transportation. Therefore, if artifacts due to confounding factors cannot be sufficiently minimized via sample processing protocols or specific experimental design, software tools aiming to remove confounding factors (for example, cells affected by ice crystals), improve transcript quantification, and reconstruct morphology and architecture of damaged tissue using image processing techniques will be essential. Specifically, reconstruction of deformed images using image registration or image deconvolution/restoration techniques and the development of computational tools to elucidate space-driven modification of tissue organization will warrant investigation.",

Axiom Space will launch and attach the first segment of its modular space station to the ISS in 2024 and build the remainder of the station while attached to the ISS. The completed Axiom Station will detach to become a free flier by 2030 (https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/nasa-details-intent-to-replace-the-international-space-station-with-a-commercial-space-station-by-2030/). Blue Origin has partnered with Sierra Space to build Orbital Reef, while StarLab will be born out of a partnership between Nanoracks, Voyager Space, and Lockheed Martin. The fourth, yet to be named, space station development effort is being led by Northrup Grumman (https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/releases/northrop-grumman-signs-agreement-with-nasa-to-design-space-station-for-low-earth-orbit). Furthermore, advances in rocket technology, including reusable engines, have lowered launch costs significantly and increased the cadence of spaceflights to and from the ISS.

For example, the speed of technology and methodology innovation for scRNA-seq and SRT is advancing the field rapidly for terrestrial investigations. Future scRNA-seq and SRT methodologies will enable simultaneous multi-omic measurements from individual cells and spatial regions. The potential of these developments has already been commercially realized for single-cell methodologies by 10X Genomics, whose Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kits offer simultaneous measurement of scRNA-seq and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) data from the same group of cells. Similar developments are in motion for SRT where co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue section via NGS has already been achieved. Moreover, spatially resolved ATAC-seq has been developed, but does not yet allow for simultaneous measurement of RNA. Given the trajectory of the single-cell and spatial fields toward simultaneous measurements of multiple genomic features, it is anticipated that the need for improved cell and tissue preservation protocols in spaceflight will persist.",

Cloud labs are essentially a virtual lab bench that allow the scientist to control the wet-lab experiment virtually and execute it remotely via an orchestra of automated robotic systems. Presently on the ISS and likely in the foreseeable future, several key operational constraints limit rapid, repeatable research in orbit: (1) limited human-tended time for executing experimental protocols, (2) variability in the on-orbit operator’s scientific and technical experience and expertise, (3) a large distance between the principal investigator (PI) and the scientific payload, and (4) inability to rapidly iterate on experimental protocols in real-time. A cloud lab in space will enable the PI to (1) control the experiment via the virtual lab bench, (2) conduct high-quality science by eliminating a variety of confounding variables that are introduced by returning samples to the ground for processing, and (3) iterate on the scientific protocol based on real-time observations of data. Furthermore, on-orbit edge processing and cloud-computing capabilities will accelerate data analysis whereby processed results can be returned to the PI via a secure downlink from the space station. Addition of such capabilities will eliminate the need for large data downloads—a practice that is slow, costly, and requires extremely high bandwidths.",

Perturbations on transcription and gene expression can be modeled using ML algorithms to test hypotheses prior to launching an experiment into space. Adapting these models to be more amenable to the environmental factors of spaceflight can help use limited spaceflight resources more efficiently. Additionally, to aid with experimental design, a specific SRT method should be selected before experiment launch to implement its optimized tissue preservation protocol, and the development status of available computational tools should be rigorously assessed to understand the expected analysis types and data resolutions available. Given the rapid advancements in SRT analysis, ideal tools and capabilities will grow quickly over time.
