In vertebrates, E. chaffeensis replicates in monocytes and macrophages. However, no clear cell or tissue tropism has been defined in arthropods. Our group identified two host genes that control E. chaffeensis replication and infection in vivo in Drosophila, Uridine cytidine kinase and separation anxiety. Using the UAS-GAL4 RNAi system, we generated F1 flies (UAS-gene of interest RNAi x tissue-GAL4 flies) that have Uck2 or san silenced in ubiquitous or tissue-specific fashion. When Uck2 or san were suppressed in the hemocytes or in the fat body, E. chaffeensis replicated poorly and caused significantly less severe infections. Silencing of these genes in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands did not impact fly susceptibility or bacterial replication. Our data suggest that in Drosophila, E. chaffeensis replicates within the hemocytes, the insect homolog of mammalian macrophages, and in the fat body, the liver homolog of mammals.",

            "text": "Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne, zoonotic disease caused by the Gram-negative, obligate intracellular bacterium, Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is primarily vectored by Amblyomma americanum (lone star tick) and is transmitted transstadially in ticks. A. americanum has a 3-host life cycle. For progression from one stage to the next (larva to nymph to adult), the tick requires a vertebrate blood meal. The major natural reservoir of E. chaffeensis in the United States is white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). However, several other vertebrates, too, act as reservoirs including domestic dog, domestic goat, white-footed mouse, red fox, raccoon, and coyote. Humans can also become accidental hosts when bitten by ticks. In humans, the bacteria are monocytotropic, meaning they are primarily found in monocytes and macrophages, and there is a good understanding of where the bacteria replicate. Although it is clear that ticks can transmit Ehrlichia organisms to vertebrate hosts, and Ehrlichia bacteria have been detected in the salivary glands microscopically and by PCR, it is less clear about bacteria replication in ticks. Although genetic tools for working with ticks are currently being developed, the available tools do not begin to approach those that are available in other arthropods such as Drosophila melanogaster.",

In vertebrates, monocytes and macrophages contribute to host resistance even though the bacteria are monocytotropic. Our group has discovered that D. melanogaster genes, separation anxiety (san) and Uridine cytidine kinase 2 (Uck2), are required for E. chaffeensis infections in flies. Flies carrying mutations in the coding regions of these genes do not support infection after needle injection. Therefore, to see if bacterial replication in arthropods parallels bacterial replication in vertebrates after needle injection, we took advantage of Drosophila UAS-GAL4 RNAi system that allowed for tissue-specific silencing of san and Uck2 to determine host sites of bacterial replication. Here, we show that similar to vertebrate hosts, in Drosophila the bacteria require optimal host conditions (i.e. expression of Uck2 or san) in the immune tissues, hemocytes, and fat body, for optimal replication.",

Cells were grown at 37°C in an 8% CO2/92% air atmosphere. The level of infection was determined by examining cyto-centrifuged cells stained with Dif-Quik stain (Fisher Scientific Company, Kalamazoo, MI). When more than 80% of cells were infected, the cells were removed with a cell scraper and frozen at −80°C in cryogenic vials. Bacteria numbers were quantified using a TaqMan-based quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay as described below. Purification of host cell-free bacteria was carried out as follows. Cells were scraped from tissue culture dishes. The recovered infected cells were placed in a 50-ml, sterile centrifuge tube and shaken with glass beads. The preparation was centrifuged at 600 × g for 20 min. The supernatant with host cell-free bacteria was transferred into a sterile tube and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mixed with blue food dye at a ratio of 0.6 ml dye for every 1 ml of PBS to help us visualize the inoculum during fly injections. Most flies were injected with 6000 bacteria per fly, however, some early experiments were done with 1500 bacteria per fly. Although the severity of infections was different with the different inocula, the experimental trends were similar.",

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using the Invitrogen’s One-Step Platinum qRT-PCR kit (#11732) in a Cepheid Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). E. chaffeensis RNA was detected using primers specific for the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (NCBI Accession # M73222). Custom-synthesized primers and probes were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA) and were used.

Since the RNAi effect is applicable at all stages of the Drosophila lifespan, we isolated the fat bodies and salivary glands from 3rd instar larvae to assess the silencing efficiency specifically in the fat body and salivary glands of our RNAi flies.

Indeed, this study provides insights about E. chaffeensis replication in arthropods. Our data confirm that Uck2 and san are needed for E. chaffeensis replication and support the hypothesis that the bacteria replicate in the hemocytes or the fat body in adult D. melanogaster. Infection was poorer in flies that had hemocyte- or fat body-specific knockdown of Uck2 or san. We concede that fruit flies and ticks have different life cycles, feeding habits, and environments, and this may not allow extrapolation of the results to the tick system. Nevertheless, this is a valuable study because it identifies sites where the bacteria replicate in a model arthropod system using experimental methods which would not have been possible in the tick system.",

Silencing of Uck2 and san in the eyes, wings, or the salivary glands of adult D. melanogaster did not affect infection. Because of the tissue-specific knockdown of the genes in these tissues, the data suggest that bacterial replication occurs predominantly in the hemocytes and the fat body. These data are consistent with the vertebrate tropism for macrophages and monocytes. Hemocytes are the arthropod host equivalent of macrophages. The fat body is functionally equivalent to mammalian liver. These data are also consistent with the previous observation that Rickettsia rickettsii invade hemocytes in ixodid ticks. Previously, our group found that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in hemocyte-like phagocytic S2 cells. S2 cells have hemocyte-like properties and express a variety of hemocyte markers such as Hemolectin (Hml), Hemese (He), Drosophila scavenger receptor-CI (dSR-CI), and croquemort, a member of the CD36 superfamily. However, because these cells have combined properties of plasmatocytes and crystal cells, we could not conclude that they are hemocytes. We also found that E. chaffeensis labeled with the pH-sensitive dye pHrodo fluoresced red after injection into adult flies, presumably because they were in the low pH environment of the hemocytes. Therefore, these new in vivo data add to the growing evidence that E. chaffeensis is capable of replicating in the hemocytes of adult D. melanogaster. Furthermore, these data are consistent with the behavior of other intracellular pathogens which are capable of avoiding the phagocytic pathway and replicate within Drosophila hemocytes. These pathogens include Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium marinum, Legionella pneumophila, and Francisella tularensis.",

These findings were intriguing since A. phagocytophilum, a bacterium closely related to E. chaffeensis, and E. chaffeensis have been detected in the salivary glands of experimentally infected ticks. In our experiments, Drosophila were infected by needle injection in the abdomen; not the natural route of infection in a tick. Ticks acquire the infection from a vertebrate host during their blood meal. Thus, the dissemination of E. chaffeensis to assorted tissues may vary due to differences in route of infection. Interestingly, in ticks, needle injection does result in bacteria in the salivary glands. However, it is possible that salivary gland and host physiology may vary among arthropods depending on the life cycle. In nature, Drosophila live on yeast growing on decaying fruit and food. This could suggest that their salivary glands are better adapted to fight potential pathogenic microorganisms and extrapolation of the data from Drosophila to ticks needs to be done cautiously.",

Because there is tissue-specific knockdown in the fat body, some residual bacterial replication should occur in the hemocytes of the flies. Indeed, this might have been the case. In general, when one looks at the bacteria growth kinetics in tissues that are not affected by Uck2 or san knockdown (eyes, wings, salivary glands), bacterial numbers generally increase over time after infection (Fig. 5). In contrast, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced in hemocytes, bacteria failed to grow (Fig. 6A and 6B). However, when Uck2 or san genes were silenced specifically in the fat body, the bacteria growth kinetics showed an initial increase in bacterial numbers for 24 h that paralleled the growth of the bacteria in the parental (non-RNAi control) fly lines (Fig. 6A and 6B). Subsequently, the bacterial numbers were reduced (Fig. 6C and 6D). These data suggest that the bacteria were replicating during the early part of the infection in the hemocytes, but because the bacteria were not replicating in the fat body, the activation of the fly immune system was able to respond more effectively against E. chaffeensis than when the bacteria replicate in both hemocytes and the fat body. We have previously found that hemocytes in adult flies as well as toll and IMD defense pathways are actively involved in host defense against E. chaffeensis. Alternatively, the failure of bacteria to thrive even in the presence of functional Uck2 and san genes in hemocytes might be because there is coordination between the hemocytes and the fat body. Several observations indicate that hemocytes can signal to the fat body to regulate the humoral immune response. Thus, signaling between the hemocytes and other immunocompetent tissue such as the fat body may play a critical role in coordinating the cellular and humoral immune response to ensure efficient defense of the organism.",

There is 59.5% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis Uck2 gene products and 83.6% identity between D. melanogaster and I. scapularis san gene products.
