            "text": "Skeletal muscles overcome terrestrial, gravitational loading by producing tensile forces that produce movement through joint rotation. Conversely, the microgravity of spaceflight reduces tensile loads in working skeletal muscles, causing an adaptive muscle atrophy. Unfortunately, the design of stable, physiological bioreactors to model skeletal muscle tensile loading during spaceflight experiments remains challenging. Here, we tested a bioreactor that uses initiation and cessation of cyclic, tensile strain to induce hypertrophy and atrophy, respectively, in murine lineage (C2C12) skeletal muscle myotubes. Uniaxial cyclic stretch of myotubes was conducted using a StrexCell® (STB-1400) stepper motor system (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min day^-1). Myotube groups were assigned as follows: (a) quiescent over 2- or (b) 5-day (no stretch), (c) experienced 2-days (2dHY) or (d) 5-days (5dHY) of cyclic stretch, or (e) 2-days of cyclic stretch followed by a 3-day cessation of stretch (3dAT). Using ß-sarcoglycan as a sarcolemmal marker, mean myotube diameter increased significantly following 2dAT (51%) and 5dAT (94%) vs. matched controls. The hypertrophic, anabolic markers talin and Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) were elevated with 2dHY but not in 3dAT myotubes. Inflammatory, catabolic markers IL-1ß, IL6, and NF-kappaB p65 subunit were significantly higher in the 3dAT group vs. all other groups. The ratio of phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a was significantly lower in 3dAT than in the 2dHY group, consistent with elevated catabolic signaling during unloading. In summary, we demonstrated proof-of-concept for a spaceflight research bioreactor, using uniaxial cyclic stretch to produce myotube hypertrophy with increased tensile loading, and myotube atrophy with subsequent cessation of stretch.",

Extended spaceflight missions that travel beyond the cocoon of the Earth’s magnetosphere subject astronauts to microgravity and outer space radiation. Risks inherent to the mechanical unloading of microgravity include degeneration of musculoskeletal tissue and the cardiovascular system. The microgravity of spaceflight indeed causes substantial wasting of skeletal muscle and weakness. Mounting evidence indicates that altered mechanotransduction, oxidative stress, and impaired stress response contribute to mechanical unloading-induced atrophy and remodeling of musculoskeletal tissue. Therefore, the identification of mechanosensing pathways during the unloading of spaceflight, and thus the effect on musculoskeletal morphology and contractile function, continues as one of NASA’s long-term mission objectives.",

            "text": "Skeletal muscles are dynamic tissues that drive body movement, protect joints and bones, serve as the primary glucose sink, and are central to systemic energy metabolism. Skeletal muscles adapt readily to changes in various stimuli, including changes in loading. Indeed, skeletal muscles remodel their morphology in response to changes in the mechanical, nutrient, and energy-sensing environments. Load-bearing skeletal muscles adapt to changes in the mechanical environment, allowing mature muscle fibers to hypertrophy in response to increased loading and atrophy when presented with decreased loading. For example, when humans participate in resistance exercise, skeletal muscles can undergo increased mass through hypertrophy of muscle fibers. In response to mechanical unloading that occurs during the microgravity of spaceflight, chronic bedrest, or casting, skeletal muscles adapt rapidly by degrading contractile protein into constitutive amino acids, suppressing protein synthesis, and thus reducing muscle fiber cross-sectional area. A common teleological argument for skeletal muscle atrophy as a biological response to unloading is that extreme disuse would accompany a significant injury or disease, both of which require an increased demand for amino acids and protein. However, the skeletal muscle wasting or atrophy that occurs with microgravity, disuse, cancer, and aging compromises physical function and systemic health.",

These bioreactors produce a low-shear, three-dimensional culture environment that mimics certain aspects of weightlessness. However, they are not suitable for inducing tensile mechanical loading in skeletal muscle fibers experience during exercise in spaceflight. Although tumbler bioreactors create a low-shear environment through rotation, they largely produce compression rather than tension on skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, tumbler or centrifugal fail to accurately reproduce the changes in tensile mechanical forces encountered by skeletal muscles during weightlessness and exercise.",

            "text": "Skeletal muscles produce and transfer tensile loads to attached tendons and bones by two mechanisms: (1) in series through muscle fibers and (2) in parallel through transverse loading of z-discs and linked costamere interaction with surrounding layers of connective tissue (e.g., endomysium, perimysium). Skeletal muscles are organized as multinucleated myofibers, whose function is to generate length and velocity-dependent forces for movement and stability. Skeletal muscle contractions and outside resistance produce net tension down a skeletal muscle’s long axis. Indeed, skeletal muscles respond to dyanamic alterations in mechanical loading by adapting muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area, and shifting the % of slow-twitch fibers. Unloading induced skeletal muscle atrophy is believed to be a function of both elevated protein degradation coupled with decreased protein anabolism. In addition, there is an increase in connective tissue in unloaded skeletal muscle as well. Thus, maintaining mechanical loading, such as tension and stretch, is crucial for muscle health and function. Therefore, the development of a bioreactor for experimental use of skeletal muscle cells (i.e., myotubes) to simulate spaceflight or exercise during spaceflight should impose similar uniaxial tensile loading or stretch, that cannot be currently reproduced with rotating wall vessels bioreactors.",

Based upon our findings we propose a microgravity bioreactor for the cellular stretch that is an analog of the FlexCell® system, which uses a vacuum instead to stretch the silastic membrane, eliciting radial loading. Instead, we employed a StrexCell® system fitted that includes a stepper motor to produce true uniaxial, cyclic stretch while eliciting tensile loading on myoblasts or myotubes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use cyclic stretch and cessation protocols with the StrexCell system on skeletal muscle myotubes as a potential bioreactor for microgravity and re-entry into gravitational environments.",

Withdrawal from cyclic stretch elicits an ‘off-transient’ period that our data suggest mimics unloading-microgravity.

In contrast, 48 h after the removal of bouts of cyclic stretch resulted in decreased anabolic signaling, increased FoxO3a dephosphorylation, thus activating pro-inflammatory and muscle atrophic signaling and causing smaller myotube diameter.

Recent reports also characterized an increase in myotube diameter ex vivo in response to mechanical stretch and stimulation. In our StrexCell application, the uniaxial cyclic stretching protocol for 2 days and 5 days produced tensile loading on myotubes, which resulted in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Thus, loading of tensile force stimulated an increased myotube diameter and size, confirming that cyclic stretch in myotubes elicits hypertrophy of the muscle fibers (Fig. 1). Overloading produced by cyclic stretch induced muscle hypertrophy that was directly linked to increased markers of anabolism and hypertrophy, including upregulation of talin and increased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. Akt activation is a causal regulator in protein synthesis signaling in skeletal muscle. For example, the overexpression of active Akt levels previously elicited skeletal muscle myotube hypertrophy. Furthermore, we found that bouts cyclic stretch activated Akt through phosphorylation at Thr308, which was linked to an elevated phosphorylated FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio which could suppress catabolism. Consistently, we previously demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme mimetic EUK-134 relieved unloading induced decrease in Akt phosphorylation (deactivation) and decrease in FoxO3a phosphorylation (activation).",

Using the StrexCell system to release from daily cyclic stretch, C2C12 myotubes underwent a significant reduction in myotube size after 3 days cessation of cyclic stretch (Fig. 1). A rapid reduction in skeletal muscle size mimics the muscle disuse atrophy that occurs with mechanical unloading. Indeed, mechanical unloading and spaceflight lead to both a suppression of anabolic signaling and an elevation of proteolytic pathways, thus leading to muscle fiber atrophy. FoxO3a is an atrophy-associated transcription factor that is translocated to the nucleus in its active form during skeletal muscle unloading. Indeed, nuclear accumulation of active FoxO3a is the atrophy-associated transcription factor FoxO3a is linked to muscle atrophy. In our StrexCell protocol, withdrawal of daily cyclic stretching led to increased levels of unphosphorylated (i.e., active) FoxO3a, consistent with protein degradation’s role in muscle atrophy (Fig. 3). The total amount of FoxO3a was nearly tripled, also suggesting potential stimulation of catabolic signaling. There was a smaller 40% increase in phosphorylated Foxo3a. thus was a statistically significant decrease (more than 50%) in the p-FoxO3a/total FoxO3a ratio, consistent with greater potential for rapid protein degradation and myotube fiber atrophy. Notably, spaceflight microgravity lowered the Akt activity pathway by downregulating the eIF4/p70S6K signaling. Furthermore, Bodine and Baehr (2014) reported that the FoxO3a transcription factor regulates the MuRF1 and MAFbx expression involved in the protein degradation process leading to muscle atrophy.",

Furthermore, we previously documented greater dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, accompanied by downregulation of an Akt-mTOR pathway with unloading-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. This is consistent with the argument that dephosphorylation of Akt can activate FoxO3a and thus enhance proteolysis during unloading-induced atrophy.

Unloading-induced muscle atrophy has been consistently linked to an elevation of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1-beta (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). Furthermore, the transcription factor NF-kappaB (NF-κB) is often elevated during mechanical unloading and may contribute to the atrophy process. We found that the inflammatory cytokines IL-1ß and IL-6 and the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB were markedly higher in the muscle myotubes after daily cyclic stretching had been discontinued for three days (Fig. 4). The large magnitude of upregulation for IL-2, IL-6, and p65 while myotubes were in a humoral free medium clearly indicated that circulating cytokines and endocrine factors could not exclusively account for the marked elevation of inflammatory signaling. Indeed, these data support the hypothesis that much of inflammatory medication in unloaded muscle fibers could be localized within the muscle fibers. Therefore, upregulation of inflammatory mediators during the loading period must be a result of mechanosensing within the myotubes, rather than circulatory factors.",

Given that IL-1ß and IL-6 can activate or be activated by NF-κB, thus it was expected that NF-kappaB subunit p65 would also upregulated following cessation of daily cyclic stretch (Fig. 4C). NF-κB has previously found to be involved in mechanical unloading-induced muscle atrophy. Upregulation of NF-κB, IL-1ß, and IL-6 can lead to a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO3 phosphorylation, consistent with a shift toward catabolic signaling.

When mechanical tensile loading is diminished or absent in vivo (e.g., spaceflight, casting, bedrest) during periods of immobility or inactivity, muscle fiber cross-sectional area is decreased in response. Even with the limitations outlined above, myotubes in this study responded significantly to bouts of cycle stretch by myotube hypertrophy and underwent atrophy when unloaded.

In addition, the StrexCell bioreactor would allow direct testing of countermeasure strategies against the adverse effects of spaceflight, including microgravity and radiation. In this study, we tested and developed an alternative bioreactor to mimic the effects of both overloading and microgravity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by imposing and withdrawing periods of cyclic tensile strain, using a StrexCell uniaxial stretch system. The withdrawal of cyclic stretch was used to demonstrate that mechanical inactivity turns off signaling for muscle hypertrophy, while elevating pro-inflammatory, pro-catabolic pathways that drive protein degradation, thus causing myotube atrophy. Therefore, we conclude that the StrexCell uniaxial stretch system is a viable alternative bioreactor to study spaceflight and re- (over)loading in skeletal muscle cells.",

C2C12 cells were capable of differentiation and are a widely used model to study differentiated skeletal muscle cells. The C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a 10 cm2 chamber filled with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, growth medium (DMEM + NA Pyruvate), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Once the myoblast cultures reached 60–65% confluency, the myoblasts were then trypsinized and re-cultured in 4 well-2 cm2 silicone chambers coated by laminin at 37 °C and 5% CO2, using 1 ml per well. Once the cells reached 70–80% confluency, myotube differentiation was initiated by switching to differentiation medium DMEM (-) NA Pyruvate, supplemented with 2% horse serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.4% insulin-transferrin-selenium. To study the effects of increased and decreased mechanical stress in C2C12 myotubes, we maintained myotubes on laminin-coated silastic membrane and initiated stretch through a StrexCell® system, then observed the effects of stretch and cessation of stretch on cellular responses. Twelve hours after beginning differentiation, the myotube silicone chambers were exposed to the uniaxial stretching using the StrexCell® unit. The differentiation medium was refreshed daily under sterilized conditions.",

StrexCell® uses a stepper motor and modular contractile cartridges to generate uniaxial stretch on muscle fibers mounted on the silastic membrane. StrexCell is automated and computer-controlled, which enables precise control of the strain levels on the cells, providing a consistent stretch at high and low frequencies of 1–20%.",

The myoblast and myotubes were then suspended in an aqueous medium, which induces equal pressure on all sides. At the micron level, gravity is a relatively weak force compared with adhesions, ion affinity, intermolecular forces, and fluid dynamics, especially in an aqueous medium that surrounds the myoblasts and myotubes.

The stretch instrument employs a computer-controlled stepper motor to drive two metal frames apart. A flexible silicone chamber was attached to both frames, and the chamber was stretched and released in a programmable sinusoidal oscillation. STB-1400 includes a 10 cm2 stretch chamber model (Culture area: 3.2 × 3.2 × 1.0 cm), which supports up to 6 chambers simultaneously. The C2C12 cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded in silicon stretch chambers coated with laminin (Fig. 5a). The amount of strain experienced by the myotubes was measured as the percent change in the stretch from the starting position (Fig. 5b). Based on the preliminary validation experiments and the published report of Soltow, et al. (2013), the strain program was set at 0.7 Hz frequency, 12% stretch using a sinusoidal wave pattern for 1 hour/day for 2 or 5 days. Exposure to the uniaxial cyclic stretching was utilized to induce hypertrophy with increased loading. Conversely, cyclic stretch cessation was deemed off-transient unloading to induce myotube atrophy release of cyclic tensile loads, with replicate control cultures maintained under quiescent conditions with no applied cyclic strain.",
