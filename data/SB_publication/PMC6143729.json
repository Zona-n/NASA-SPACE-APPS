The ISS isolate exhibited an increased rate of growth and pigment distribution compared to a terrestrial strain. Analysis of the isolate’s proteome revealed significant differences in the molecular phenotype of JSC-093350089, including increased abundance of proteins involved in the A. niger starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition. Together, these data reveal the existence of a distinct strain of A. niger on board the ISS and provide insight into the characteristics of melanized fungal species inhabiting spacecraft environments.",

Microorganisms have been reported to cause biodegradation of structural spacecraft components, resulting in decreased integrity of spacecraft hardware. Microbial infections also constitute a major health risk for astronauts, especially in closed environments where the combined stresses of sleep disruption, microgravity, and high levels of radiation may further compromise the human immune system. Studies have suggested that microbial virulence and antimicrobial resistance increase in response to spacecraft environments. Other reports have associated the abundance of filamentous fungus in indoor environments with allergies and invasive infections. Additionally, fungi produce a myriad of bioactive secondary metabolites (SMs) in response to environmental stressors, and while many SMs have diverse therapeutic and industrial applications, others are toxins and can have detrimental effects on human health. As we set our exploration sights beyond low-Earth orbit, a thorough understanding of how fungi respond and adapt to the various stimuli encountered during spaceflight is critical to the success of long-term space travel.",

In general, it is thought that microgravity alters biological processes by initially altering the physical forces acting on the cell and its environment. This results in decreased transfer of extracellular nutrients and metabolic by-products, causing the cell to be exposed to a completely different chemical environment. The inside cabin of the ISS is exposed to a complex radiation environment, at levels that are not fungicidal, permitting fungi to thrive. Radiation primarily interacts with biological systems through the ionization and excitation of electrons in molecules, and its strong mutagenic properties result in an increased rate of biological evolution. Further, radiation can have many harmful effects on biological systems, which results in the development of adaptive responses. Fungi inhabiting spacecraft are also forced to acclimate to reduced nutrient availability, as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) routinely performs stringent microbial monitoring and remediation on the ISS.",

A. niger is a melanized fungal species that is ubiquitous in nature and commonly used in biotechnology industries as a production host for citric acid and enzymes. Despite the recurring detection of A. niger in spacecraft environments, investigations into its genetic alteration and gene expression modulation under ISS conditions have not been carried out. Although A. niger is less pathogenic to humans than other Aspergillus species, such as A. fumigatus and A. flavus, it has been associated with ear infections and can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients. This enhances the need for studies to understand how A. niger responds and adapts to the environment of the ISS, where microgravity might play a role in compromising the human immune system. Additionally, melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation and respond to radiation with enhanced growth and upregulation of many proteins, some of which may provide important insight into the adaptive evolutionary mechanism of melanized fungal species.",

Although it has been well established that fungi are ubiquitous on spacecraft, very few studies have been conducted to characterize fungi isolated from the ISS. Given that melanin production in fungi is considered an evolution-derived trait to confer radiation resistance, the present study of a melanized fungus that has inhabited the ISS may reveal important insights into the key traits necessary to withstand such environments. Our work investigated differences of the ISS A. niger isolate from Earth isolates to better understand the characteristics of strains isolated from the space station built environment. Due to the significance of secondary metabolic processes in filamentous fungi, A. niger ATCC 1015 was used as a terrestrial reference strain for physiologic and proteomic analyses because its SM profile has been thoroughly characterized, and we aim to build on this work by investigating SM production in JSC-093350089.",

A strain of A. niger, JSC-093350089, identified by morphological characteristics and verified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing, was used for this study. This strain was isolated by swabbing surface materials on the U.S. segment of the ISS. Due to the nature of this sampling method, it is impossible to know the exact duration of time that this strain was on the ISS. The 36.08-Mb genome sequence of JSC-093350089 was generated using whole-genome paired-end sequencing (WGS), which was further improved to high-quality assemblies of 223 scaffolds possessing 12,532 coding sequences and 287 tRNAs. The JSC-093350089 genome was similar in size to other A. niger genomes, which typically range from 34.0 to 36.5 Mb. To further verify the identity of JSC-093350089 and place it into the larger context of the A. niger/welwitschiae/lacticoffeatus clade, phylogeny was assessed using maximum likelihood (Fig. 1). Of the A. niger strains surveyed, the ISS isolate displayed the closest phylogenetic relationship to A. niger (phoenicis). Compared to ATCC 1015, an industrial strain used for citric acid production, and CBS 513.88, an ancestor of the A. niger strains used industrially for enzyme production, it differed by 37,548 and 39,433 variants, respectively.",

All MS data were analyzed using the Proteome Discoverer with the Sequest-HT search engine against the A. niger CBS 513.88 protein database (NCBI). The CBS 513.88 protein database was used because it has been extensively annotated and enabled subsequent functional analysis using the AspGD Gene Ontology (GO) Slim Mapper tool. The abundance ratios for all proteins were normalized to ATCC 1015, which resulted in the identification of 218 proteins with increased abundance and 109 proteins with decreased abundance (fold change [FC] >|2|, P < 0.05), in JSC-093350089, relative to ATCC 1015 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Distribution of AspGD GO Slim terms among differentially expressed proteins is displayed in Fig. 3. Many proteins that exhibited increased abundance in JSC-093350089 were involved with carbohydrate metabolic processes (10.1% of all upregulated proteins), response to stress (9.6%), organelle organization (9.6%), and transport (8.7%).

Conidia of A. niger possess a relatively thick cell wall made of a network of carbohydrates, including β-glucans, chitin, α-glucans, galactomannan, and galactosaminogalactan, with an outer cell wall layer consisting of complex melanin pigments. The polyketide synthase AlbA (An09g05730), which is required for the production of 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin (DHN-melanin) in A. niger, was over 2-fold more enriched in JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015. The protein abundance of hydrophobin Hyp1 (An07g03340) was nearly 3-fold higher than in ATCC 1015. RodA, the homologue of Hyp1 in A. nidulans, has been reported to play a role in biofilm formation and efficient deconstruction of cell wall polysaccharides. Its homologue in A. fumigatus was shown to enhance fungal virulence by masking dectin-1- and dectin-2-mediated recognition of conidia in vivo.",

The starvation-induced cellobiohydrolase CbhB (An01g11660), which is regulated by XlnR, exhibited levels nearly 3-fold higher in the proteome of JSC-093350089 than in ATCC 1015. XlnR is a transcriptional activator that regulates xylanolytic, endoglucanase, and cellobiohydrolase gene expression in A. niger. Increased protein abundance was observed for β-d-xylosidase XlnD (An01g09960), which is also regulated by XlnR. Decreased protein abundance was observed for XlnR-regulated β-galactosidase LacA (An01g12150), which is exclusively expressed on xyloglucan-derived substrates. Similarly, XlnR-regulated endoglucanase EglC (An07g08950), which exhibits its greatest activity toward xyloglucan, also displayed decreased protein abundance. Other starvation-induced cell wall degradation glycoside hydrolases enriched in JSC-093350089 included α-1,3-glucanase AgnB (An07g08640) and β-glucanase Scw4 (An06g01530). Differential abundance of glycoside hydrolases involved in starch utilization was also observed. Extracellular acid α-amylase AamA (An11g03340), which plays a role in starch degradation and is regulated by starch degradation regulator AmyR, was present in JSC-093350089 at levels 4-fold higher than that in ATCC 1015. Four of the five enzymes in the family of GH92, which consists of mannosidases, displayed increased abundance in the proteome of JSC-093350089.

An06g01610 is very similar to late embryogenesis abundant (LEA)-like Hsp12 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and has been reported to stabilize the plasma membrane. Increased protein abundance was observed for the serine/threonine protein kinase Srk1 (An07g07970) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase SakA (An08g05850), which have been reported to mediate cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial function in response to oxidative stress. Other proteins that exhibited higher levels in JSC-093350089 included the oxidative stress protein Svf1 (An18g02900) and An02g07350, which encodes a protein homologous to group 3 LEA proteins responsible for mitigating stress-induced damage, such as protecting seeds from drought. The catalase An12g10720 was present at levels 13-fold higher than that of ATCC 1015.

To further understand the effect of microgravity and enhanced irradiation on fungal genomics, future studies should investigate the same strain grown under both space and ground conditions to quantify and identify any mutations that may result from life on the ISS. Additional sequencing of terrestrial A. niger strains will also be important to better identify the donor population of the strain and further isolate the sequence variation that is specific to ISS-derived strains.",

While A. niger historically has black conidia due to its high melanin content, the A. niger ΔalbA mutant was reported to display a white or colorless conidial phenotype. This is consistent with reports that fungi isolated from high-radiation environments exhibit increased melanin production. One study found that A. niger strains occupying the south-facing slope of the “Evolution Canyon” in Israel, which receives 200% to 800% higher solar radiation than the north-facing slope, produced three times more melanin than did strains isolated from the north-facing slope. It is reasonable to presume that increased melanin production is a key adaptive response to the enhanced irradiation environment of the ISS, as there is considerable evidence that melanized fungi are highly resistant to ionizing radiation under experimental conditions. In fact, it has been reported that exposure of melanin to ionizing radiation alters its electronic properties, and melanized fungal cells exhibit increased growth rates following exposure to ionizing radiation.",

Although this finding cannot be definitively attributed to the isolation environment, it is conceivable that rapid growth may confer a selective advantage in environments operating under strict microbial monitoring procedures. The reported increase in colony pigmentation distribution may point to enhanced melanin production in the ISS isolate, as the AlbA protein was 2-fold more enriched than in the terrestrial strain. However, the ability to rapidly spread pigment to the periphery of the colony may offer additional modes of protection from high levels of radiation present in spacecraft.",

During starvation, A. niger produces a myriad of glycoside hydrolases that facilitate the release of nutrients from biopolymers and the recycling of cell wall components to generate energy and building blocks that can be used for maintenance and conidiogenesis. The observed enrichment of starvation-induced nutrient acquisition enzymes may be the result of adaptation to the low-nutrient environment that exists as a result of stringent microbial monitoring and remediation by NASA. The same may also be true for the increased abundance of the glycoside hydrolase AamA. AamA is highly upregulated in growing hyphae at the periphery of mycelium, and following secretion from exploring hyphae, AamA degrades starch into small molecules that can be taken up by the fungus to serve as nutrients. The significant enrichment of AamA suggests that JSC-093350089 can utilize starch encountered during colonization more efficiently than ATCC 1015, which may have conferred a selective advantage in the low-nutrient spacecraft environment.",

Accordingly, catalase was among the highest-upregulated proteins in the ISS isolate, which degrade H2O2 and therefore play a major role in curtailing oxidative stress. This is consistent with previous reports that spaceflight induces the expression of oxidative stress resistance genes in microbes, animals, and astronauts, and increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation has been observed in S. cerevisiae strains lacking cytosolic catalase. Similarly, increased abundance was also observed for kinases that mediate key biological processes in response to oxidative stress. The high levels of oxidative stress response proteins, as found in this study, are consistent with the observed response of the melanized yeast Wangiella dermatitidis following exposure to ionizing radiation. On the other hand, increased resistance to oxidative stress may be a response to microgravity, as low-shear modeled microgravity has induced such a response in bacteria.",

Given the ubiquity of A. niger in nature along with its genetic diversity among sequenced strains, it is not surprising that JSC-093350089 exhibited a distinct molecular phenotype, and more studies will reveal if the observed phenotype is widespread for other A. niger strains isolated from the ISS. Since most of the microgravity-induced response studies were carried out utilizing opportunistic pathogens of bacteria and yeast, the “omics” characterization of ISS A. niger, a saprophyte, which exhibited higher melanin content than its Earth counterparts, could be a model to elucidate molecular mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation to the ISS environment. Developing countermeasures to eradicate problematic microorganisms that adapt to unfavorable conditions would help NASA’s Human Research Program in planning for long-duration manned missions.

These markers were searched using PHYling (https://github.com/stajichlab/PHYling_unified), which first searches for conserved markers using HMMsearch followed by extraction of best hits and concatenated alignment of all the orthologous matches. A back-translated alignment of coding sequences was produced from the input proteins in order to resolve the closely related strains in this data set. A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the coding sequence tree using IQTREE (v1.6.3) first by identifying a partition scheme with -m TESTMERGE -st CODON parameters followed by a tree inference using the options -st CODON -bb 1000 -spp Partition.txt to infer the tree and obtain branch support with ultrafast bootstrapping on the reduced partition parameters under a codon model in IQTREE.
