In adult female glands, terminal tubule cells, also called granular intercalated duct cells, retained from prenatal and early postnatal stages, often are observed at the acinar-intercalated duct junction (Fig. 1C). These cells contain numerous small dense secretory granules ranging in size from 0.6 to 1.3 μm. In males, the terminal tubule cells undergo androgen-dependent apoptosis and are completely lost by about 1 month of age. The intercalated ducts, consisting of cuboidal cells that occasionally contain a few small granules, connect to a short striated granular duct which is confluent with the granular convoluted duct. The granular convoluted ducts consist of tall columnar cells, with basal nuclei, variably infolded basal cell membranes with adjacent mitochondria, and numerous large dense granules in the supranuclear cytoplasm. (Fig. 2) As described by, smaller dense granules often are present in the cytoplasm between the large granules. These ducts are well-developed in adult male glands, constituting about 45% to 60% of the gland parenchyma (Fig. 2A). In female glands, the granular convoluted duct cells are smaller than those of males, contain fewer secretory granules (Fig. 2B), and constitute about 25% of the parenchyma. The granular convoluted ducts are confluent with the striated ducts, which become excretory ducts as they enter the connective tissue septa dividing the gland into lobules and lobes.",

Male mice flown for 30 d on the Bion-M1 biosatellite had an increased content of SABPα in acinar cell secretory granules, and EGF and NGF in granular convoluted duct cell secretory granules, when compared to that in the habitat ground control mice. This appears to be a specific effect of microgravity. The shorter 13 d and 15 d flights on the space shuttle, however, did not cause increased expression of these proteins in female glands. This suggests that longer exposure to microgravity may result in more profound changes. Other factors also may play a role, such as the age and sex of the mice, stresses during landing given the different space craft, and the time elapsed between landing and dissection. It is possible that the different diets consumed by the mice on the space shuttle flights compared to those on the Bion-M1 flight could have resulted in differences in protein expression. The comparisons in the present study, therefore, are made between the flight mice and habitat ground control mice that were fed the same diets.",

Their synthesis is enhanced by dietary tannins and by the administration of isoproterenol. Regulation of PRP gene expression by tannins and β-adrenergic agonists occurs via the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling system, whose responses vary with the amount of stress imposed on the system. Long-term spaceflight appears to have minimal effects on components of the cyclic AMP/protein kinase A system. Relatively modest changes in the levels of salivary and plasma corticosteroids and catecholamines occur as a result of spaceflight in both animals and humans. This suggests that the mice from these missions experienced minimal stress due to the spaceflight environment. Stress associated with landing and post-flight readaptation to gravity potentially could affect the salivary glands. However, the relatively short interval between landing and tissue collection for the STS-131 and STS-135 flights may have minimized such effects. This is supported by the lack of significant changes in PRP expression.",

SMGC expression in females is decreased after ovariectomy and increased by β-estradiol administration. No differences in immunogold labeling were observed for the residual terminal tubule/granular intercalated duct cells present in the submandibular gland of the female mice flown on the two space shuttle missions.

While plasma levels of androgens and thyroid hormones were not determined in the male mice from the Bion-M1 mission, previous studies have shown decreased plasma testosterone in rats, and decreased plasma, salivary and urinary testosterone in astronauts. Decreases in thyroid function and plasma levels of thyroid hormones after spaceflight have been observed in rodents and humans. The increase in EGF and NGF expression in the granular convoluted duct cells of the Bion-M1 flight mice thus was unexpected. However, androgens and thyroid hormones also act through non-classic nongenomic pathways; it is possible that microgravity may influence EGF and NGF expression via signaling intermediates that intersect with these pathways. The increased expression of both EGF and NGF by approximately 60% in flight mice compared to habitat ground control mice suggests that the same regulatory pathway(s) was activated for both genes.",
