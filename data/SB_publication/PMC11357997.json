In 2021, the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission launched the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, which included the youngest American astronaut (aged 29), new in-flight experimental technologies (handheld ultrasound imaging, smartwatch wearables and immune profiling), ocular alignment measurements and new protocols for in-depth, multi-omic molecular and cellular profiling. Here we report the primary findings from the 3-day spaceflight mission, which induced a broad range of physiological and stress responses, neurovestibular changes indexed by ocular misalignment, and altered neurocognitive functioning, some of which match those of long-term spaceflight, but almost all of which did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) after return to Earth. Overall, these preliminary civilian spaceflight data suggest that short-duration missions do not pose a significant health risk, and moreover present a rich opportunity to measure the earliest phases of adaptation to spaceflight in the human body at anatomical, cellular, physiological and cognitive levels. Finally, these methods and results lay the foundation for an open, rapidly expanding biomedical database for astronauts, which can inform countermeasure development for both private and government-sponsored space missions.",

However, with the emergence of private space programmes and broadening access to orbital missions, new opportunities for research and discovery have emerged for civilian engagement with spaceflight. Specifically, SpaceX has now launched or announced several privately supported missions, including the all-civilian Inspiration4 mission and the Polaris Dawn series of missions (including on Starship). These missions enable a broader representation of astronaut cohorts, spanning a wider range of ages (for example, the youngest American astronaut, Hayley Arceneaux), balanced representation of sexes, diverse genetic and medical backgrounds, as well as opportunities for new science, technology, art and public engagement during their missions.",

This orbital class mission reached 590.6 km in altitude; the farthest distance crewed orbital missions have been into space since the Gemini programme. Although the crew spent only 3 days in low Earth orbit, they experienced similar hazards of spaceflight as International Space Station (ISS) missions (often 6–12 months in duration), including radiation exposure, sustained microgravity, the closed and hostile environment of space, isolation and confinement, and long distance from Earth resources. Thus, the Inspiration4 mission, and similar missions, provide a platform to study these acute exposures endemic to low Earth orbit, with unique data collection opportunities in the earliest phase of the human body’s response to spaceflight.",

The Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to test the feasibility of medical research aboard a commercial spaceflight mission crewed by non-professional astronauts, as well as new clinical and research protocols, which spanned a wide range of assays and experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Specifically, the Multimodal Evaluation of Spaceflight Health protocol for the Inspiration4 mission from the Translational Research Institute for Space Health (TRISH) funded multiple investigators to conduct separate yet related investigations on the Inspiration4 mission, and deployed a battery of tests to understand some of the major effects of short-duration spaceflight on humans, including portable ultrasound measurements, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys, physiological data collected with a smartwatch and blood/saliva testing. Moreover, a comprehensive Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) protocol, based on the NASA Twins Study, was used to measure multi-omic, clinical and immune profiles in whole blood, serum, plasma, saliva and biopsied skin samples. In this Article, we present and discuss the key findings from studies evaluating the Inspiration4 crew’s comprehensive multi-omics analyses of biospecimens, ultrasound imaging, otolith function, cardiovascular physiology and cognitive performance, which together enable an in-depth biomedical research approach for private crews on upcoming missions and unprecedented access to these data and samples.",

First, epigenetics data from single-nuclei chromatin (single-nuclei ATAC-seq) profiling showed more than 70,000 peaks per sample, which were enriched for genes involved in DNA repair, immune activation and nucleosome organization, notably matching results from the NASA Twins Study. Second, telomere elongation was observed for all crew members, but all other metrics of genome stability, sequence divergence and clonal haematopoiesis were unchanged. Third, we observed an average of 668 metabolites and more than 4,000 proteins per sample in plasma, which was smaller than the 637 proteins per sample in the exosome population, yet the exosome proteomic data revealed unique, brain-associated peptides. Fourth, direct RNA nanopore sequencing showed a mean of 13,022 transcripts per sample, plus a significant spike in methyl-6-adenine (m6A) levels on the day of landing, R + 1 (ref. ); this was complemented with a range of 18,632–29,900 genes detected across all single-nucleus RNA sequencing data. Fifth, we characterized the spatial biopsies of the crew samples with GeoMx, which revealed a mean of 16,433 genes per section, with evidence of disrupted inflammation in pathways near the surface of the skin. Finally, we examined the microbiome of the crew, using shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics before, during and after spaceflight, and we found a spike in virus abundance in-flight, as well as 3.6 million non-redundant genes at 90% identity, 1,287 metagenomic assembled genomes and 1,544 assembled viral genomes.",

Therefore, we generated virome reactivity profiles of the Inspiration4 crew across mission phases, leveraging a highly multiplexed assay (‘PepSeq’) that measures immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity to peptides representing the human virome. PepSeq analysis using a previously described 15,000-peptide assay covering 80 human-infecting viral species showed that the reactivity profiles of dried blood spot samples collected in-flight clustered with those of terrestrial samples from the corresponding astronauts (Fig. 2a), indicating that the collection and storage of samples during flight did not adversely affect their quality. The time-invariant reactivity profiles of the four astronauts included reactivity to 45 species (Supplementary Table 3) and were dominated by reactivity to peptides from respiratory viruses and Epstein–Barr virus, as expected (Fig. 2a).",

The remainder were species associated with common upper respiratory infections: Rhinoviruses A and C (n = 2 and n = 1, respectively) and Adenovirus C (n = 1). The Epstein–Barr virus events included changing reactivity that overlapped with flight for astronauts C001 and C002 during flight (Fig. 2b), although these specific viruses were not found in the sequence data (Fig. 1).

Assessment of cross-reactivity and specificity showed no significant non-specific binding, with a minimal background sometimes visible for IgM (Extended Data Fig. 3d). The limit of detection for CRP and IgM was 0.01 and 0.7 µg ml−1, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4a). The intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were less than 20% (Extended Data Fig. 4b), and the presence of some high-level outliers was the result of a low spatial distribution homogeneity that was compensated by measurement repeatability (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Post-flight examination of the 0g-VFI showed that absorbing pads displayed a marked area, suggesting that an average of 80 µl of fluid crossed the membrane, thus highlighting both that fluid displacement occurred in the microgravity environment and that it was correctly used by the Inspiration4 crew (Extended Data Fig. 3e). Finally, the analysis of 0g-VFI membranes showed that no IgM or CRP were detected for the devices run in space following standard protocol (15 min incubation) by the crew (Extended Data Fig. 3f). Unused kits stored in the Dragon capsule were run post-flight on Earth and did not display any changes either. Furthermore, control kits stored on Earth with hygroscopic compounds for the same period (that is, the duration of the flight experiment) and run for 15 min also showed strong intensity, suggesting the need to maintain low humidity levels during storage. Accelerated stability studies conducted in an environmental chamber at 42 °C and 75% humidity confirmed the effect of desiccation on VFI performance, with a more than 8-fold decrease in intensity after storage without a hygroscopic compound (Extended Data Fig. 5).",

The Inspiration4 mission featured the first in-flight research use of Butterfly iQ+, a handheld single-probe ultrasound device for urinary bladder, internal jugular vein (IJV) and eye imaging in full crew autonomy (Fig. 3). Aims for all targets included both the assessment of physiological changes in response to spaceflight and evaluation of autonomous procedure efficacy. Eighty-nine imaging instances (multiframe cine of varied length) were collected pre-flight, and 108 imaging instances were collected in-flight, yielding an average of 27 instances per astronaut (range = 18–32 instances). Bladder imaging success scores were above the usability threshold (2.33 ± 0.24 (s.d.); range = 2.0–2.5; Methods), demonstrating the effectiveness of the imaging system and the instructions for urinary bladder volume assessments (Fig. 3b). However, these image sets did not reveal significant physiological trends, possibly due to variability between the small number of astronauts and crew-reported operational constraints affecting the timing of data acquisition relative to voiding. The bilateral IJV images were the highest in quality (2.36 ± 0.51 (s.d.); range = 1.8–2.9) and thus amenable to quantification and analysis. The in-flight image sets from ocular imaging (the most intricate procedure) consistently scored below the usability threshold in all four astronauts (0.76 ± 0.51 (s.d.; range = 0.0–1.1); the mean ocular success score was lower than both the bladder and IJV success scores, which were of similar quality.

In contrast to long-duration ISS cohorts and regardless of flight day (FD1–3), both IJVs were free from thrombi and flow anomalies in all Inspiration4 astronauts. Spontaneous antegrade flow was demonstrated in all examined IJVs by colour and (or) spectral Doppler and no spontaneous echo contrast was detected. While previous studies of astronauts in both short-duration (less than 7 days) and long-duration spaceflight have demonstrated a stable increase in IJV CSA, the absence of flow anomalies and spontaneous echo contrast in all four astronauts suggests a potential difference from respective long-duration spaceflight data and the possibility of lower risk of IJV thrombosis in the early period of microgravity exposure. The effect of inspiratory resistance breathing using an impedance threshold device (ITD) on IJV filling (reflected as CSA) appeared more pronounced on the right side, but varied among astronauts and did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 3d, t-test, P values > 0.05). Notably, the measurements were concordant among astronauts pre-flight and in-flight (Fig. 3d), indicating reliable data collection and encouraging further inquiries into the potential of ITD-like interventions as a countermeasure against thrombosis in cases of clinical concern with commensurate flow anomalies.",

The otolith organs are an integral component of the neurovestibular system that transduce sensory effects, particularly linear acceleration and gravity. Any normal asymmetry between otoliths on the two sides of the head is compensated for by central neural processes on Earth; however, this compensation is inappropriate in microgravity, which can lead to vertical and torsional ocular misalignment. This asymmetry (as manifest in ocular misalignment) has also been associated with increased susceptibility to space motion sickness (SMS). Ocular alignment was assessed in the Inspiration4 crew, as a proximal measure of otolith asymmetry, during the pre-flight and post-flight phases using a computerized test that measured vertical (vertical alignment nulling (VAN)) and torsional (torsional alignment nulling (TAN)) ocular misalignment. VAN and TAN data collected on the Inspiration4 crew showed no consistent and systematic effects of spaceflight from pre-flight to post-flight. VAN, however, exhibited different patterns between astronauts who experienced SMS in-flight compared to those who did not (Fig. 4). Two of the four Inspiration4 crew (50%) experienced SMS, which is consistent with earlier reports that 50–67% of astronauts experience SMS during short-duration spaceflight. Astronauts who did not experience SMS (Fig. 4a,c) exhibited consistent vertical misalignment both pre-flight and post-flight, and that misalignment was different after the flight than before the flight. This is presumably because post-flight testing reflects the in-flight adaptive state, and that 0g-adapted state should, in general, be different from the 1g state (P values < 0.001; Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 6). A statistical evaluation of the proposed interpretation of SMS susceptibility was developed to validate these observations (Supplementary Information).",

Astronaut cardiovascular physiology was measured with the Series 6 Apple Watch, which astronauts donned on FD2 and wore for an average of 1.3 ± 0.1 days in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 1). Significant changes across mission phases were observed for crew heart rate (Extended Data Fig. 7a,e) and heart rate variability (HRV; Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 7b,f), and differential heart rate changes between astronauts were also observed (F = 9.46, P < 0.0001). Studies of heart rate in spaceflight have yielded mixed findings, and relative to pre-flight, only C004 exhibited decreased heart rate (Supplementary Table 5), as well as increased HRV (Fig. 5d). These cardiovascular changes in C004 were accompanied by lower blood oxygen saturation in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 7c,g), yet post-flight measures of cardiovascular function did not differ from baseline (pre-flight) upon return to Earth. Consistent with earlier studies, increased heart rate post-flight, relative to pre-flight, was observed for two astronauts, C001 and C002; C001 also exhibited elevated blood oxygen saturation levels post-flight. Furthermore, the crew exhibited substantially lower overall activity in-flight relative to pre-flight (F = 6.65, P < 0.0001), which was accompanied by reduced active energy expenditure (Extended Data Fig. 7d,h; F = 9.29, P = 0.0001); this reduced energy expenditure was driven by C001.",

The cabin environment was measured via sensors in the spacecraft, while sound pressure levels were measured using the Apple Watch. Environmental variables fluctuated over time in-flight (Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 5). The Inspiration4 crew were confined to the Dragon capsule, which has a volume of 9.3 m3, and were free to move about the cabin. The Dragon cabin environment is nominally controlled to 14.7 psi and 21% O2, in-flight O2 partial pressures averaged 3.1 psia (range = 3.0–3.3 psia; equivalent to 20.4–22.4%) and CO2 averaged 0.8 mmHg (range = 0.4–2.0 mmHg). Temperature and humidity are controlled to maintain a comfortable short-sleeve environment; the crew had the capability to adjust the temperature, which averaged 25.5 °C (range = 21.8–27.9 °C) in-flight. Relative humidity could range between 25% and 75% (typically around 50%) and averaged 29.9% (range = 27.3–52.3%). The Dragon environmental conditions were equivalent to those on the ISS, with O2 ranging from 2.8 psia to 3.0 psia, temperature ranging from 18 °C to 25 °C, relative humidity of 25–75% and a cabin pressure ranging from 3.8 psia to 14.9 psia. Aside from one period with high sound pressure levels in three astronauts post-flight, sound pressure levels were similar across mission phases; of note, the spacecraft produced around 50 dBA of background noise. Noise exposure remained below the occupational 8 h exposure limit of 80 dBA for all but one data point (Extended Data Fig. 8e,g). In-flight, three of the four astronauts exhibited a significant and positive association between CO2 levels and higher HRV (Fig. 5f); however, other spacecraft environmental factors, including cabin pressure and temperature, did not exhibit consistent relationships with HRV.",

This multidimensional battery included blood, stool, urine, biopsy and saliva samples, ultrasound measurements of the eye, jugular vein and bladder, cognitive and sensorimotor tests, surveys and physiological data collected with an Apple smartwatch. These data showed some of the same signatures of long-duration spaceflight, such as inflammatory response, DNA damage response gene expression (and proteins), telomere elongation and immune signalling changes (Figs. 1 and  2), and demonstrated that such phenotypes can also be observed in the earliest phases of spaceflight and across a shorter mission time frame. Moreover, this mission also enabled new biomedical metrics for spaceflight, such as RNA methylation, single-nucleus chromatin, single-cell expression metrics and spatial transcriptomics. Overall, this work demonstrated that a diverse civilian crew can conduct scientific experiments, process samples and significantly contribute to spaceflight research with minimal risk. Although two astronauts presented with SMS, most metrics (for example, IJV size, heart rate, complete blood count metrics, gene expression and cytokines) were either stable or quickly reverted to pre-flight levels (baseline) after landing on Earth.",

Due to flight certification constraints required for all technologies used in spaceflight, the desiccant usually placed in the packaging kit to avoid high humidity exposure during long-term storage had to be removed, and has been identified as the main cause for the alteration of the assay efficiency in-flight. For future missions, reagent and system stability studies will have to determine optimal storage conditions without the use of hygroscopic compounds.

The choice of targets was motivated by high-priority concerns and risks reported over the years of ISS missions. For example, flow anomalies in the IJV (for example, severe stasis, flow reversal) frequently develop in ISS crew members in the later stages of long-duration spaceflight; however, such alterations in cardiovascular function have been less studied in the earlier days of spaceflight when precursors to cardiovascular risks may begin to emerge. In the Inspiration4 mission, IJV flow anomalies were not observed in any of the four astronauts, suggesting that flow anomalies develop later in-flight. The lack of IJV flow anomalies also diverge from Earth-based simulations of microgravity (head-down tilt), which demonstrate IJV and other vascular alterations after five days of exposure. If corroborated by future studies in short-duration spaceflight, this finding may further our understanding of the mechanisms and progression pattern of flow degradation in the left IJV during sustained microgravity. Inspiratory resistance reduced right IJV CSA by an average of 36% pre-flight (supine) and 29% in-flight but did not reach statistical significance in this small cohort of astronauts. This trend suggests facilitated IJV drainage due to resistance breathing, and the experiment demonstrated a simplified in-flight screening method, with resistance breathing as an option to correct anomalous IJV flow. Overall, these findings bode well for the cardiovascular safety profile of short-duration missions, although future studies that address other anatomical targets are needed, as the effects of spaceflight are not uniform throughout the cardiovascular system. A better understanding of the cardiovascular risks could alleviate some of the spaceflight health concerns for private citizens with diverse health backgrounds and medical histories, although notably, no health issues were observed in the Inspiration4 crew.",

Probing the potential limitations of miniaturized ultrasound technology combined with the rapid deployment and complete crew autonomy was an inseparable part of the experiment. This autonomy is in stark contrast to the ISS experience, where all imaging sessions are conducted with a traditional device and in real-time interaction with experts in the mission control centre. The anatomical and technical quality of the images, expressed as overall success scores, appeared inversely related to the complexity of the autonomous procedures. Bladder imaging (the simplest procedure) and IJV imaging (intermediate difficulty and complexity) each had similar scores, well above the usability threshold. Conversely, the ocular imaging procedure (most intricate), which required precise gaze control and accurate probe manipulation by real-time visual feedback, did not produce image sets of sufficient quality to derive the intended measures, such as globe axial length or optic nerve sheath diameter. In this study, all but the most intricate procedures could be successfully performed by minimally trained users with the aid of appropriate JIT materials. Based on these findings, as well as those acquired during similar applications on the ISS, ocular imaging with JIT instruction in future missions should involve a dedicated ultrasound operator; however, other exams can be reliably performed in self-scanning, autonomous mode, which represents a significant medical and research capability in situations with degraded communications (for example, high latency, loss of communication). Payloads consisting of a miniaturized imaging system with an intuitive interface can enable future experiments featuring short lead and training times, rapid deployment, flexible schedules and data collection autonomy, which will enable scientific research opportunities even on the most constrained of spaceflight missions.",

The incidence of SMS was 50% in the Inspiration4 mission, which is consistent with the reported incidence in short-duration spaceflight. Second, there is no relation between motion sickness susceptibility in parabolic flight and susceptibility in orbital flight, yet early work on torsional alignment was performed in parabolic flight to predict susceptibility in orbital flight. Third, our results with VAN are promising for SMS prediction, while results with TAN are not (of note, the original work relating SMS to ocular skew was done with torsion). Finally, SMS has multiple contributing factors and multiple manifestations that vary between individuals, and thus it may be unrealistic to think that a single measure will continue to have high predictive power in a larger population.",

Also, a single institutional review board (IRB) protocol, such as that put in place by TRISH, can simplify subject consenting, while a standardized database provider (TrialX, funded by TRISH) was critical for data ingestion, cross-institute sharing and standardization for future cross-mission analyses and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches. Finally, the consent and release forms of study participants were envisioned for long-term use, with datasets managed under the oversight of a data release board, and for these precious samples to be utilized and characterized for many years to come.",

The HV2 library has been previously described and consists of 15,000 30mer peptides covering 80 viral species and selected based on earlier evidence of reactivity in other cohorts. PepSeq libraries were synthesized and used to profile IgG binding, as previously described. Briefly, DNA-barcoded peptide libraries were generated using bulk in vitro enzymatic reactions, starting with the PCR amplification of oligonucleotide templates and their transcription to generate mRNA. The product was ligated to a hairpin oligonucleotide adaptor bearing a puromycin molecule tethered by a polyethylene glycol spacer and used as a template in an in vitro translation reaction. Finally, a reverse transcription reaction, primed by the adaptor hairpin, was used to generate cDNA, and the original mRNA was removed using RNAse. To perform serological assays, 0.1 pmol of the resulting DNA-barcoded peptide library (5 μl) was added to 5 μl of neat, reconstituted blood spot solution and incubated overnight. The binding reaction was applied to prewashed protein G-bearing beads, washed, eluted and indexed using barcoded DNA oligos. Following PCR cleanup, products were pooled, quantified and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument yielding a depth of more than 900,000 reads per sample.",

Curing was then performed under intense ultraviolet light at 70 °C for 30 min, followed by trimming of the support scaffolds. First, the different pad layers were stacked inside of the pad holder as follows (ordered top to bottom): sample pad (made from chopped glass with binder (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo)), polyethersulfone filter, conjugate pad, retarding and flow-directing pads both made of thin glass fibres (Grade 8950, Ahlstrom Munksjo). All layers were assembled with double-sided, medical-grade pressure-sensitive adhesive (ARcare 90106NB). Second, a 3.5-cm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 320, Ahlstrom Munksjo) was positioned in the membrane housing with a 6-mm-diameter cotton pad (Grade 222, Ahlstrom Munksjo) on top, both acting as absorbent pads.

Anatomical accuracy criteria included whether the target was clearly and contiguously visible, along with essential anatomical landmarks; technical quality criteria included elements such as image clarity, gain, acoustical interference, artefact and shadowing. An overall success score was derived as the mean of these two scores, with a usability threshold set at 2.0. This quality filter served to reject anatomically inaccurate or technically flawed images. To determine whether the success of imaging instances varied by anatomical target, a one-way ANOVA tested for in-flight differences in imaging success scores among anatomical targets (that is, bladder, IJV and eye); post hoc pairwise comparisons between anatomical targets were conducted via Tukey’s honest significant difference. To evaluate the effect of impedance breathing on IJV CSA, a series of paired, two-tailed Student’s t-tests were conducted; differences between normal and impedance breathing were evaluated by averaging IJV CSA for each condition within each mission phase (that is, pre-flight and in-flight).",

            "text": "The otolith organs of the vestibular system transduce linear acceleration and gravity. The sense organs consist of a mass of calcium carbonate crystals (otoconia) that overlie a membrane that is innervated with hair cells. Motion of the crystals relative to the hair cells bends the hair cells, and this bending modifies their firing rates and so provides information on linear acceleration to the central vestibular system. While generally symmetric, there is reason to believe that there are slight asymmetries between the otolith organs on the two sides of the head, in otoconial mass or synaptic sensitivity. This asymmetry is compensated by central neural processes, but this compensation becomes inappropriate in gravity fields other than 1g, leading to changes in vertical and torsional ocular alignment. In particular, the magnitude of torsional misalignment in altered g levels has been associated with susceptibility to SMS. G-dependent changes in vertical alignment have also been demonstrated in parabolic flight and laboratory studies. Data on SMS in-flight were obtained via self-report.",

For these tests, the subject views a red line and a blue line on the touchscreen of a tablet computer, through colour-matched red and blue filters, one over each eye. This provides independent images to each eye. Since the test is performed in darkness, there is no visual information that is seen by both eyes together, and hence there are no visual cues to align the eyes (which would fuse the images on the two retinas). One line remains fixed on the screen, while the other line is positioned by the subject, either vertically or torsionally. The subject’s goal is to adjust one line until it appears to be aligned with the other, stationary, line (that is, to null any apparent vertical or rotational offset between the lines). The final amount by which the lines are separated from one another vertically or rotated relative to one another provides a measure of vertical or torsional ocular misalignment, respectively, which produces measures of VAN and TAN. Astronauts completed VAN and TAN measures twice pre-flight and twice post-flight, where each session consisted of 11 VAN and 11 TAN trials. There was no in-flight testing.",

The t-tests were performed after removing outliers, which were defined as values more than three scaled median absolute deviations from the median, where median absolute deviation is a measure of the deviation of the values from the median (analogous to the standard deviation for data from normal distributions) and can be reduced to a sequential decision tree for prediction of individual SMS susceptibility (Supplementary Note 2). There are several reasons for this individual testing as opposed to a pooled analysis across subjects. First, the high variability across subjects (typical of many neurovestibular assessments), combined with the small subject pool, makes it unlikely that there would be sufficient statistical power in a pooled analysis. Second, individual testing permits a stepwise approach in which a series of tests can lead to a predictive metric. Finally, SMS is notoriously idiosyncratic, and spaceflight measures are subject to many confounds, which supports a focused longitudinal examination.",

For each CRP and IgM plot, a four-parameter logistic model was used to generate the fitted curve and the limit of detection (LOD), represented as a dotted line, was determined using the following formula: , where LOD is equal to the mean of the negative control (negC) + 3 standard deviations (σ) of the negative control. b, Intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) across CRP and IgM assays are presented; CVs were calculated by CV (%) = (Standard Deviation/Mean) x 100. For the inter-assay CV, each point represents the CV of the control spots obtained from three independent identical replicates of 7 CRP and IgM 0g-VFI membranes (n = 14).
