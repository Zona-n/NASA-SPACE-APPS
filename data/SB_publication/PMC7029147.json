Conidia (asexual spores) of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus synthesize several metabolites, including melanin, which has been reported to be important for virulence in this species and to be protective against UV radiation in other fungi. Here, we investigate the role of melanin in diverse isolates of A. fumigatus and find variability in its ability to protect spores from UV-C radiation or impact virulence in a zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis in two clinical strains and one ISS strain. Further, we assess the role of other spore metabolites in a clinical strain of A. fumigatus and identify fumiquinazoline as an additional UV-C-protective molecule but not a virulence determinant. The results show differential roles of secondary metabolites in spore protection dependent on the environmental stress and strain of A. fumigatus. As protection from elevated levels of radiation is of paramount importance for future human outer space explorations, the discovery of small molecules with radiation-protective potential may result in developing novel safety measures for astronauts.",

            "text": "Fungi are versatile organisms which thrive in hostile environments, including the International Space Station (ISS). Several isolates of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus have been found contaminating the ISS, an environment with increased exposure to UV radiation. Secondary metabolites (SMs) in spores, such as melanins, have been shown to protect spores from UV radiation in other fungi. To test the hypothesis that melanin and other known spore SMs provide UV protection to A. fumigatus isolates, we subjected SM spore mutants to UV-C radiation. We found that 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)-melanin mutants of two clinical A. fumigatus strains (Af293 and CEA17) but not an ISS-isolated strain (IF1SW-F4) were more sensitive to UV-C than their respective wild-type (WT) strains. Because DHN-melanin has been shown to shield A. fumigatus from the host immune system, we examined all DHN mutants for virulence in the zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis. Following recent studies highlighting the pathogenic variability of different A. fumigatus isolates, we found DHN-melanin to be a virulence factor in CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 but not Af293. Three additional spore metabolites were examined in Af293, where fumiquinazoline also showed UV-C-protective properties, but two other spore metabolites, monomethylsulochrin and fumigaclavine, provided no UV-C-protective properties. Virulence tests of these three SM spore mutants indicated a slight increase in virulence of the monomethylsulochrin deletion strain. Taken together, this work suggests differential roles of specific spore metabolites across Aspergillus isolates and by types of environmental stress.",

In addition to protecting fungi from UV radiation, fungal melanins are potent virulence factors in both human-pathogenic (e.g., Cryptococcus neoformans, Fonsecaea pedrosoi, and A. fumigatus) and plant-pathogenic (e.g., Venturia inaequalis and Verticillium dahliae) fungi.",

Finally, we examined any role of the DNA repair ku70 and ku80 mutants on UV-C sensitivity, as these mutants are frequently used for molecular manipulation of the A. fumigatus genome due to the ease of gene replacement in these backgrounds and the general robust nature of these mutants.

However, AkuA is involved in DNA repair and would be expected to show enhanced sensitivity to UV treatment. The disruption of akuA significantly decreased the survival rate, at 90%, in contrast to 60% decrease in survival of wild-type (WT) Af293 upon UV-C exposure (Fig. 1A); however, there were no differences in UV-C sensitivity between the ΔakuA mutant and the ΔakuA mluc strain, which was also used for gene deletion studies (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Despite an increase in sensitivity to UV-C, the ΔakuA mutant strains still demonstrated a dose response to increasing UV-C and thus were deemed suitable for this study.

As shown in Fig. 2A, the loss of pksP resulted in strains more sensitive to UV-C regardless of the presence or absence of akuA. This increase in sensitivity was seen at all UV-C doses in a comparison of the WT to the ΔpksP mutant (∼50% versus ∼25% survival rate at 10 mJ/cm2, ∼23% versus ∼3.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and ∼7% versus ∼0.9% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) and in a comparison of the ΔakuA mutant to the ΔakuA ΔpksP double mutant (∼7% versus ∼3% at 10 mJ/cm2, 2% versus 0.5% at 15 mJ/cm2, and ∼1% versus 0.1% at 20 mJ/cm2, respectively) (Table S2A).

Due to their synthesis in the spore as well as aromatic structure and incorporation of tryptophan in two of these metabolites (fumigaclavine and fumiquinazoline), they were tested to determine if they might also provide protection from UV-C in Af293. Mutants were created for all three metabolites in both WT akuA and ΔakuA mutant backgrounds (Fig. S3). SM analysis of these deletion mutants confirmed that they did not synthesize the targeted metabolite. Specifically, fumigaclavine C (366.5 g/mol), monomethylsulochrin (346.3 g/mol), and fumiquinazolines C and D (443.5 g/mol) were not detected in extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) of the respective deletion mutants (Fig. S4). Considering that trypacidin is not detectable until 9 to 10 days of growth, monomethylsulochrin (the final intermediate of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway) was used to confirm the disruption of the trypacidin biosynthetic pathway. In the WT background, the fumiquinazoline mutant (ΔfmqA) was more sensitive to UV-C (35%) (Fig. 4C and Table S2D), but the loss of either fumigaclavine (ΔdmaW mutant) or trypacidin (ΔtpcC mutant) pathway metabolites had no impact on spore survival (Fig. 4A and B and Table S2D). However, examination of these same SM mutations in the ΔakuA background gave different results, where strains deficient in fumigaclavine A (ΔakuA ΔdmaW mutant) and trypacidin (ΔakuA ΔtpcC mutant) were slightly more resistant to UV-C than was the ΔakuA control after exposure to 10 mJ/cm2 (P = 0.0043 and 0.0006, respectively) (Fig. 4D and E and Table S2E) and the fumiquinazoline null strain (ΔakuA ΔfmqA mutant) showed no significant change in UV-C resistance compared to ΔakuA (Fig. 4F and Table S2D compared to 2E). These findings suggested that akuA loss alters the UV-C-protective properties of some conidial pigments and may allow for the identification of mutants that can enhance UV-C resistance.",

The disruption of akuA gene, which increases the transformation success rate via homologous recombination (HR), led to a ca. 90% decrease in survival upon exposure to the lowest UV-C dose, 10 mJ/cm2, while the Af293 WT showed a decrease of 60% for the same dose (Fig. 1A). Such discrepancy in the survival rates between the ΔakuA mutant and the WT was of no surprise, as previous reports showed that UV-C exposure significantly induces DSB incidence in exposed organisms and cells. Further, no significant differences were observed in the SM profiles of the tested control strains (Fig. 1B), suggesting that akuA gene disruption was the main cause of the observed drop in strain survival upon UV-C exposure. However, we found that using an akuA null background could mask the ability to identify UV-C-protective SMs, possibly dependent on the relative contributions of each metabolite. For instance, the deletion of pksP in Af293 resulted in increased sensitivity to UV-C regardless of the akuA background (Fig. 2), but the protective property of fumiquinazoline was masked in the ΔakuA background (Fig. 4C versus F).",

Previous studies with other fungi have demonstrated the importance of DHN-melanin in UV protection, but an examination of melanin in different isolates within a species has not been reported, to our knowledge. Af293, CEA10, and CEA17 are commonly studied clinical strains of A. fumigatus and in IF1SW-F4, a strain previously reported as being isolated from the ISS. Further, DHN-melanin-deficient strain CEA17, but not strain IF1SW-F4, was more sensitive to UV-C (Fig. 3). These data suggest that there might be other metabolites which are important for tolerating the UV-C stress in IF1SW-F4. We also note that different A. fumigatus strains synthesize different SMs and different amounts of each SM which could contribute to differences in UV-C sensitivity (Fig. 3). Such UV-C-protective compounds are of paramount importance during future outer space explorations, as they may be implemented to protect other organisms, including humans and plants.",

Using the neutrophil-deficient zebrafish model of invasive aspergillosis, we found this to be true but not in the manner we had anticipated. We had hypothesized that there might be a correlation between the importance of DHN-melanin in UV-C protection (where PksP protected Af293 and CEA17; Fig. 2 and 3) and virulence, but instead, we found that the CEA17 and IF1SW-F4 ΔpksP mutants (but not the Af293 mutant) showed a loss in virulence as measured by zebrafish mortality (Fig. 5). CEA17 showed the most significant attenuation of virulence of the two isolates. Different strains of A. fumigatus, including CEA10 (and derivatives such as CEA17) and Af293, have previously been shown to vary in virulence (in human cells, Drosophila melanogaster, murine and zebrafish models). DHN-melanin is an important cell wall component that impacts cell wall morphology and assembly and has been shown to be involved in the protection of conidia from the host immune cells in A. fumigatus ATCC 46645. The results from both the UV-C sensitivity tests together with the virulence assessment suggest that the role of DHN-melanin in conidial protection varies with the type of environmental stress.",

Fumiquinazoline C is composed of three residues, including the aromatic amino acid tryptophan and its precursor anthranilic acid. We hypothesize that this metabolite may contribute to UV production, possibly through tryptophan- and anthranilic acid-absorbing properties, and that its protective properties were masked in the highly UV-sensitive ΔakuA background (Fig. 4). We found that the loss of fumigaclavine or trypacidin intermediates had no impact on UV-C protection in an AkuA WT background, and these strains were actually more resistant to UV-C in the akuA background than control strains (Fig. 4). The increased resistance might possibly be explained by findings where the loss of one SM often results in increased synthesis of another SM, possibly one with some UV-C protection in this case. We had thought that trypacidin loss would result in increased sensitivity to UV-C, as several of its precursors (e.g., emodin and questin) are pigmented anthraquinones that have been shown to protect Xanthoria elegans and Cetraria islandica against UV. Possibly, there are not enough anthraquinones synthesized in Af293 to have a measurable effect on UV sensitivity. We further assessed the impact of the loss of these SMs on virulence in the zebrafish model and found no correlation to sensitivity to UV-C (Fig. 4 and 6). These results parallel our observations on DHN-melanin loss, namely, that each SM may have differential role dependent on environmental stress.",

Upon exposure, treated and untreated (control plates) were incubated at 37°C. After 7 days, CFU were enumerated, and the percent survival was calculated using the following formula: no. of CFU exposed to any given dose (N)/CFU in control plate (N0) × 100.

Prior to infection, larvae were screened and selected for mCherry expression in neutrophils to identify individuals harboring the dominant negative allele. Briefly, hindbrain ventricle infections were performed at 48 h postfertilization using conidial stocks that were mixed 2:1 with 1% phenol red (used to visualize injection success) to a final concentration of 1 × 108 conidia/ml stock. Larvae were anesthetized in E3 lacking MB and supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Tricaine prior to microinjection of 3 nl conidia stock or PBS vehicle control into the hindbrain ventricle through the otic vesicle. Following microinjection, larvae were rinsed several times to remove the anesthetic and transferred to individual wells of a 96-well plate in ∼200 μl E3 lacking MB. The survival of individual larvae was scored daily using a loss of heartbeat as a readout of mortality. Survival analysis for larval zebrafish infection experiments was performed as previously described by pooling experimental replicates and generating P values by the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis.",
