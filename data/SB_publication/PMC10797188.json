Drosophila parasitoid wasps modify blood cell function to suppress host immunity. In this study, naive and parasitized ground and space flies from a tumor-free control and a blood tumor-bearing mutant strain were examined. Inflammation-related genes were activated in space in both fly strains. Whereas control flies did not develop tumors, tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. Surprisingly, control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than mutant flies; many of their essential genes were downregulated. Parasitoids appeared more resilient than fly hosts, and spaceflight did not significantly impact wasp survival or the expression of their virulence genes. Previously undocumented mutant wasps with novel wing color and wing shape were isolated post-flight and will be invaluable for host-parasite studies on Earth.",

Robust immune physiology and intact genomes are vital to the success of manned space exploration efforts. Animals and plants harbor a diverse array of microbial and metazoan pathogens and parasites. While the effects of the space environment in low Earth orbit are documented on many host species, with a focus on humans, the effects of space on the accompanying pathogens and parasites are not known. This question is especially important as immune-compromised humans (and other animal hosts), or those with dysfunctional immunity, venture into space. Experiments with the Drosophila model organism and studies on astronauts over the last decade have revealed how highly conserved innate immune functions and mechanisms are altered in space. These and earlier studies (reviewed by Iyer et al.) also demonstrated that fruit flies can successfully develop in space, opening the system to further inquiry. In this study, we examined the effects of spaceflight on D. melanogaster infested with their natural parasitoid wasps that journeyed to and back from the International Space Station (ISS), aboard SpaceX-14, on a 34-day mission.",

            "text": "Parasitoid wasps represent a large class of obligate parasitic insects, and many are used in the biocontrol of agricultural pests. The term endoparasitoid refers to the wasp whose preimaginal stages develop within the host larva and pupa. The developing parasitoid (or parasite) eats the host as both continue to develop; the host builds a puparium that a parasite ultimately occupies and emerges from. Drosophila larvae and pupae serve as hosts to more than 60 species of such parasitic wasps. The female wasp’s sharp ovipositor pierces the first line of host defense—the larval exoskeleton, made of cuticle—to introduce an egg and venom. This step triggers an encapsulation response in which larval blood cells (hemocytes) of the hosts’ innate immune system (macrophage-like plasmatocytes—called macrophages here—and their derivatives, lamellocytes) cooperate to recognize, surround, melanize, and destroy the wasp egg. This melanotic capsule itself, composed of dozens of macrophages and lamellocytes, shields the host from the dead parasite as it continues to become an adult fly. Encapsulation, an innate immune response, is conserved across many multicellular animals.",

Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) is highly successful on many Drosophila species and is considered to be a generalist parasite. Its venom contains spiked extracellular vesicle (EV)-like structures with immune-suppressive activities. Lh EVs are surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer, and their protein composition is similar to that of mammalian EVs. L. boulardi (Lb) is a specialist parasite and is successful on a narrower host range than Lh. Lb EVs also bear spikes, are immune-suppressive, and have a protein profile similar to Lh EVs. There is no evidence that either Lb or Lh EV-like structures possess a genome or that they replicate in either the wasp or the host. The protein-coding genes of Lh EVs are present in the wasp genome.",

Lb EVs enter lamellocytes and alter lamellocyte shape to suppress encapsulation without killing them. Lh EVs, on the other hand, lyse lamellocytes within a few hours after infection. Lh EVs also kill circulating macrophages as well as hemocyte progenitors housed within a small hematopoietic organ called the lymph gland. Thus, despite differing in the ways they attack host hemocytes, both wasps effectively create immune-deficient hosts, making it conducive for wasp development. In 20–25 days, one adult wasp emerges per fly pupa; male and female wasps mate as free-living adults, and females then deposit eggs into fly larvae to initiate another generation.",

The latter strain carries a dominant germline mutation in the Janus kinase (JAK) gene to activate the transcription factor called Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT). The mutation constitutively activates the fly’s innate immune JAK-STAT and Toll signaling pathways. Components of both pathways are highly conserved in evolution, including humans. Both immune pathways also control hematopoietic development. Their genetic activation in the fly leads to the overgrowth of hematopoietic progenitors. As a result, small granuloma-like tumors form melanized structures that are observed in the larval hemolymph. In their physical properties, these small tumors are analogous to the hemocyte capsules formed around wasp eggs and are considered to be autoimmune-like reactions to self-tissue. Tumor growth, inflammatory gene expression, and metabolic inflammation in hopTum-l larvae are sensitive to aspirin administration. Thus, the hopTum-l background is a “stand-in” disease model for animal leukemia and CI. In humans, aberrant JAK-STAT and Toll-nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling is linked to malignancies, immune deficiency, inflammation, autoimmunity, and cancer and is therefore the focus of therapeutic measures.",

We report that fewer than expected tumor-free control fruit fly strain returned to Earth, but, unexpectedly, the tumor-bearing CI strain succeeded in space just as well as ground controls. In both strains, genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or ECM-associated proteins (together, matrisome proteins) that contribute to cuticle and chorion structure and function were strongly affected in space, but genes essential for life were downregulated only in the control fruit fly strain. Orthologs of many of these genes have disease relevance in humans. However, inflammation-related genes were activated in both strains, and, while the control flies remained free of tumors, the tumor burden in the space-returned CI strain increased. The effects of spaceflight on parasite emergence were minimal, if any, and changes in the expression of virulence genes were modest, at best. The venom activity of Lh from space wasps was comparable to that of ground wasps, and their virulence EV particles were normally distributed within the hosts. Visible mutations affecting wing shape, color, and ovipositor integrity were identified in the progeny of space L. heterotoma.",

The trend was somewhat different for the hopTum-l animals that did not appear to suffer from the effects of spaceflight; while spaceflight actually favored male viability slightly but significantly (average 44 versus 57 males/vial), female development remained unaffected (Figures 2A–2C). Thus, under the FFL-03 experimental protocol, animals of the two genetic backgrounds responded differently to spaceflight, underscoring the complex interplay of these factors.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2Fold Change (FC)| > 1. The close clustering of the four replicates and high variation among the four sample types in the principal-component analysis (PCA) show that the experiment was well controlled (Figure S1A). Overall, the y w strain was more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l, with 13.22% versus 6.78% DEGs (spaceflight versus ground control samples), respectively (Table S1), a difference that is also reflected in the PCA plot (Figure S1A). A separate RNA-Seq analysis of white-eyed (w1118) flies, also on the SpaceX-14 mission, reported 6.49% and 3.25% DEGs in S0 versus G0 female and male fly heads, respectively (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p values < 0.05; total number of genes expressed was 13,991). Although the sample types in the two studies are different, these results suggest that the y w strain is more sensitive to space conditions than the y w hopTum-l and the w1118 strains. On Earth, the hopTum-l strain showed 9.69% DEGs relative to y w, with more than two-thirds of DEGs upregulated and the remaining DEGs downregulated. In space, this differential expression was enhanced (14.03% of genes affected), but the proportion of upregulated versus downregulated genes was roughly equal (Table S1).",

These Cp genes are clustered on the X and third chromosomes, and the gene clusters are selectively amplified in the follicle cells of the ovary. (c) Top DEGs upregulated in S0 hopTum-l, when compared to the respective ground control group (G0 hopTum-l), include Cpr family genes, Osiris family genes, tracheal-prostasin (tpr), a protein important for sleep regulation (nemuri, nur), and CG3108 (Figure 3E).

Remarkably, gene expression changes were milder in space-flown hopTum-l samples, with the expression of only 10 genes significantly affected; either 2 genes were upregulated or 8 genes were downregulated, compared to respective ground control samples (Figure 4A). These results likely explain why y w flies were more sensitive to spaceflight than hopTum-l flies.",

Strikingly, we observed 22 DEGs that were significantly downregulated in S0 y w versus G0 y w flies. Oseg5 and Biotinidase expression was downregulated in G0 hopTum-l versus G0 y w flies; for both genes, this downregulation was maintained in space. Only two genes, veil and melt, showed significant upregulation (Figure 4B). This analysis revealed that human orthologs of these 34 fly genes affect many aspects of human physiology (see Figure 4B for details). The remaining 17 essential DEGs, with a low DIOPT value (i.e., < 12), were annotated with enzymatic, developmental, or unknown functions. The most significantly upregulated genes in hopTum-l versus y w flies were l(2)03659 (enables organic anion transporter activity) and Ir40a (involved in response to humidity changes), both maintaining differential expression in space. In addition, six DEGs, each in S0 y w flies and S0 hopTum-l flies, were either upregulated or downregulated, relative to their corresponding ground controls (Figure 4C).",

The difference was not significant in space hosts (Figures 7A and 7B). These results suggest that, while S1 larval progeny may be adapting to normal gravity and other terrestrial conditions, they retain altered immune physiology of their space parents, albeit transiently.

Because of the high inflammation state of space animals, we examined differences in lymph gland lobes from third-instar G0 and S0 animals. A normal lymph gland has multiple, paired lobes, consisting of hemocytes, positioned along the tubular dorsal vessel that continues into a pulsating heart, which directs the flow of the hemolymph and circulating hemocytes into the body cavity (Figures S5A–S5D). The anterior-most lobes are the largest, with hemocytes at varying differentiation stages. The posterior lobes are smaller in size and harbor fewer differentiated cells than the anterior lobes. The margins of all lobes from naive y w ground and space hosts were continuous with none-to-little dispersal.

A majority (> 98%) of the EV transcripts were identified in our RNA-Seq analysis (312/316 for Lb17 and 398/406 for Lh14). In Lb17, 29/312 (9.89%) EV genes were significantly differentially expressed (Figure 8D). Of these, 28 were downregulated (Table 1). Two mildly downregulated genes are predicted to encode RhoGAP superfamily proteins (GAJA01018902.1, log (2)-FC = −1.27, and GAJA01006288.1, log (2)-FC = −1.09). A RhoGAP superfamily protein called LbGAP in Lb EVs is implicated in wasp virulence. Of the two downregulated wasp RhoGAP superfamily proteins, only one (GAJA01018902.1) showed homology to LbGAP: 69.7% nucleotide sequence identity (68% query coverage; 8e-55). For Lh14, only 5/398 (1.61%) transcripts were significantly differentially expressed. Of these, only one gene, lacking annotation, was about 5-fold upregulated (Table 2). Of the downregulated genes, three lack annotations, and one is predicted to encode a protein with a chitin-binding domain.",

The relative success of parasite versus host in individual vials suggested that each Leptopilina species successfully disarmed both y w and hopTum-l hosts in space and also on Earth (Figures 2D and 2E). However, while no hopTum-l hosts escaped parasitization by Lb or Lh in either ground or space cultures, some y w flies emerged in the co-culture vials (Figure 2D), likely because these hosts overcame parasite infection or remained uninfected by the available parasites. When total wasps were scored relative to all insects (% wasps/total insects in each vial; Figure S9A), we found no significant difference in space- versus ground-reared wasp samples.

The overall shapes and morphologies reported previously were maintained in both samples. In addition to the regularly shaped, spiked particles, there were many particles with heterogeneous shapes, although most had spike-like processes. We observed small membranous protrusions on the particles from both G0 and S0 EV samples that were previously not reported. The G0 and S0 Lh14 EV morphologies were also indistinguishable (and similar to previously reported structures), in scanning electron micrographs of gold-coated samples (Figures S10H–S10S).

The Biosatellite II mission reported multiple effects of spaceflight alone, or that of radiation in conjunction with spaceflight, on D. melanogaster and H. juglandis. D. melanogaster, however, continues to be an obvious choice for space travel studies for all the advantages the model organism offers researchers on Earth. Among the most cost-effective model systems, its high fecundity and small size facilitate the study of large numbers of individual flies, which is necessary for statistically relevant experimental protocols. These previous “fruit flies in space” studies have tackled a variety of questions, including development, aging, mating, cardiac, and neural functions, that have implications for astronaut health.

Molecular analysis revealed a complex interplay between genetic and environmental conditions. Three trend lines are noteworthy, which are discussed in the following.

Chitin and its associated proteins are part of the fly’s exoskeletal matrisome, and together they support the cells they surround structurally and functionally.

Future experiments will help clarify the differential effects of space on the expression of essential genes in these genetic strains. Many of these essential fly genes are conserved, and their human orthologs are linked to disease conditions.

In contrast, like their parents, many immune genes in naive G1/S1 larvae were active in hopTum-l larvae. Even though changes in mitotic indices of host hemocytes or their lymph gland morphologies were not detected in these S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae, a significantly enhanced T score was observed in naive S1 versus G1 hopTum-l larvae.

Because of the complete dependence of the parasite on the host, either situation would be detrimental to parasite development. In an alternative scenario, if the effects of spaceflight on fly hosts are modest, then endoparasite development should not be affected. Wasps of both species developed successfully in the ISS environment; the more virulent Lh14 species was equally successful in both conditions, while Lb17 survival was marginally compromised in space. This difference in Lb17 versus Lh14 success may have to do with their dissimilar virulence strategies, with Lb17 being less successful on D. melanogaster than Lh14. Global gene expression changes in space-raised parasites were remarkably mild, and less than 1.5% of the adult parasite transcripts were affected. Consistent with parasite emergence results, the transcription of many more genes was affected in S0 Lb17 than in S0 Lh14. Thus, even though radiation in space led to germline mutations in one of the two parasites, the overall detrimental effects of microgravity were not sufficiently strong to block parasite development. We speculate that the notable overall success of both parasites in space may be due to their endoparasitoid life histories: developing internally, the preimaginal stages remain protected from the environmental challenges in space. Parasites have varied life histories and distinct survival strategies in the context of host physiology. With increased travel to space, it is inevitable that parasites will unintentionally hitch a ride with their hosts. With plans for the colonization of other planets, multigenerational experiments on “short life cycle” organisms such as D. melanogaster and their associated flora and fauna will become important. Innovative and sophisticated hardware designed for multigenerational studies will be helpful in this regard.",

The abundance and distribution of G0 and S0 Lh14 EVs in the dorsal vessel and lymph gland lobes of infected animals further suggest that the integrity of S0 Lh14 EV is comparable to that of controls.

In our study, male wasps were used to evaluate the effects of radiation on their germline, while female wasps were used in virulence assays. Screening grandsons of S0 Lh14 males developed in space resulted in the isolation of two visible mutants, one of which is homozygous viable, while the other is homozygous female-sterile. Dosimetry measurements on SpaceX-14 recorded an average absorbed dose rate of 0.3 mGy/day, or 9.6 mGy for the 32-day duration in the ISS. Being in low Earth orbit, the ISS is protected by the Earth’s magnetosphere. Yet, chronic exposure to these radiation levels likely resulted in DNA damage in the germline of the parasites reared in space. Despite efforts to shield the space station from the damaging consequences of radiation, our results support previous studies showing that animals in the ISS are at risk for DNA damage and physiological dysfunction. Given the success of this mission, systematic studies designed to compare the effects of radiation on Drosophila and Leptopilina may be particularly insightful, as both species yield high numbers of progeny and mutant phenotypes can be scored in the F1 generation. The risks of radiation increase considerably with the planned manned lunar missions and other deep space missions for long-term colonization. Future model organism studies can help assess the hazardous effects of radiation on soma versus germline genomes and inspire ways to avert these risks with innovative shielding designs. The isolation of mutant wasp lines will advance our understanding of wasp genomics, genetics, and host-parasite biology. The space environment is likely to have as-yet unknown impacts on animal immune function; refining our understanding of host-parasite systems with new genetic tools on Earth will broaden our understanding of immune function in space.

            "text": "Spaceflight experiments with live organisms are constrained by the weather, the logistics of the launch and retrieval protocols, the duration of the mission, the physical conditions within the ISS module, and available crew time. This study faced all these constraints. Although the 34-day mission duration aligned well with the overall goals of our experiment, by the end of the mission, the number of G0/S0 larvae was insufficient to set up infections with G0/S0 wasps. (Available G0/S0 larvae were dissected to examine lymph gland hemocyte morphologies [Figure S5].) It is quite likely that the effects of infection on the T + E values in G0/S0 hosts (infected with G0/S0 wasps) would be stronger than what we observed in G1/S1 hosts. The availability of fresh fly media for culturing naive G0/S0 adult flies, born in space or on ground, would have ensured sufficient numbers of larval hosts for these infection experiments, a strong consideration for designing future experiments.",

The difference in fly food volume accommodated the respective life histories of the two insect species; unlike flies that depend on fly food medium, wasps consume the growing fly larvae and pupae. This volume of fly food supported insect growth for 34 days while keeping carbon dioxide production to a minimum.",

Wasp infection modifies fly development; it takes 20–25 days for wasps to develop into adults, while naive flies complete their development in 10–15 days. Weather-related issues delayed the original mission time from 31 days to 34 days. The ISS crew installed the samples into the Columbus Module endcone with the CTB lid open to promote air exchange between the VFBs and cabin air, where they remained until approximately two days prior to their return to Earth. Samples remained at ambient temperature (∼22°C). Temperature and humidity data in each VFB were collected throughout the flight mission.

While the temperatures between space and ground samples were similar for the duration of the experiment, the relative humidity of space samples was higher by 20–25% than that of ground samples.

For Figures 2 and S9, each experimental vial was considered a replicate, and statistical analysis of insect survival in space relative to ground after their return to the lab was performed in Microsoft Excel 2016. The mean numbers (± standard error) of flies and/or wasps from 14 vials were calculated in Microsoft Excel (2016). Student’s t test statistic was applied, and the difference between the corresponding space versus ground samples was significant if p < 0.05. For the data in Figures 6D and 6E, the weighted average number of tumors per animal in S0 versus G0 flies, or S1 versus G1 flies, was calculated in Microsoft Excel. The mean ± standard error was calculated, and a Student’s t test was used to determine biological significance. For Figure 7B, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired samples was performed to compare all conditions pairwise. p values < 0.05 were considered significant. For Figure 9H, more than 1,000 F2 males were scored from unmated dihybrid females, and the raw numbers obtained are shown. A standard chi-square test was applied to accept the null hypothesis. For Figure 9I, at least 30 larvae per condition were dissected and scored for signs of infection. For Figure S11, the means of the proportion of bipolar cells in the L. heterotoma virulence assay were compared in experimental versus control samples using Excel and a Student’s t test. Between 129 and 1,146 lamellocytes were scored per replicate. For differential gene expression analysis in R using DESeq2, all groups were compared using the Wald test. To generate the F statistic p value and false discovery rate (adjusted p value), the likelihood ratio test was used. Corrections for multiple testing adjustment were performed using Benjamini-Hochberg. Genes were considered differentially expressed if adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1.",
