By profiling plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) from the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew, we generated “spaceflight secretome profiles,” which showed significant differences in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While >93% of differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in vesicles and metabolites recovered within six months, the majority (73%) of plasma DAPs were still perturbed post-flight. Moreover, these proteomic alterations correlated better with peripheral blood mononuclear cells than whole blood, suggesting that immune cells contribute more DAPs than erythrocytes. Finally, to discern possible mechanisms leading to brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, we examined protein changes in dissected brains of spaceflight mice, which showed increases in PECAM-1, a marker of BBB integrity. These data highlight how even short-duration spaceflight can disrupt human and murine physiology and identify spaceflight biomarkers that can guide countermeasure development.",

The plasma proteome provides a catalog of proteins circulating in the blood, and thus it can paint an informative picture of the systemic physiological state of astronauts, yet there are scant studies of astronaut plasma proteomics. Previous plasma proteomic studies of long-duration spaceflight reported changes in platelet function, coagulation, hemostasis, immune function, and metabolism. In addition, various ground-based analog studies (i.e. head-down bed rest) have reported blood proteomic changes including complement activation, acute inflammatory responses, fibrinolysis, and thrombosis. Moreover, da Silveira et al. demonstrated that mitochondrial disruption and oxidative stress were the key hubs for increased health risks, based on miRNA biomarkers in plasma.",

EVPs are actively released into the peripheral circulation at concentrations of > 109 vesicles/mL, and are demonstrated biomarkers in cancer, traumatic brain injury, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, EVP cargo analysis could be used to monitor health risks associated with space exploration, such as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) and thrombosis, but studies of spaceflight-induced changes in EVP cargo have been limited. Moreover, for metabolites, prior missions have focused on markers of bone metabolism and musculoskeletal deconditioning, including increased osteogenesis and resorption markers (e.g., osteocalcin, sclerostin, parathyroid hormone, osteoprotegerin, and RANKL) in the blood of crew members, and could benefit from a wider profile. The decreased muscular activity associated with spaceflight leads to a loss of nitrogen and an inability to maintain whole-body protein synthesis rates, exacerbated by hypocaloric intake, but this has not been examined in EVPs or metabolites in recent missions. Prior missions have also revealed spaceflight anemia, with circulating red blood cells and plasma volume decreases of 10–15%, leading to increased iron availability, though the effect of these changes on EVP cargo is unknown.",

For that study, EVP protein cargo showed changes related to physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and the first indication of brain-derived proteins in plasma-circulating EVPs. However, the NASA Twins study only used untargeted plasma proteomics (capturing 292 proteins) to discern an increased ratio of apolipoprotein B (APOB) to apolipoprotein A1 (APO1). Of the 60 plasma metabolites involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glycolysis, amino acid, fatty acid, ketone body, and pyrimidine metabolism, no significant changes for in-flight levels were found. However, it is necessary to expand the NASA Twins study findings to an increased number of samples, larger coverage of metabolomics, broader coverage of plasma proteomics, longitudinal data of EVP proteomics, and a systematic integration and meta-analysis of secretome changes with other multi-omic data.",

We profiled the spaceflight secretome (plasma proteome and metabolome, and EVP proteome) of the i4 astronauts at three pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) and three post-flight timepoints (R + 1, R + 45, R + 82). We performed differential and pathway enrichment analysis of the proteome and metabolome to reveal the biological landscape of the secretome changes induced by 3-day spaceflight. Then, we delineated the contribution of blood and immune cells by comparing secretome and transcriptomic profiles obtained from the i4 single-nuclei PBMC and whole-blood RNA-seq. We performed thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS) measurement assays, EVP immune cell marker profiling, Western blots, and ELISA to validate findings. The unique insight of integrating these different modalities (proteomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics) in our study provides the largest comprehensive assessment of the systemic physiologic and secreted changes resulting from spaceflight exposure to date.",

Importantly, the majority of EVP DAPs returned to pre-flight levels over time, with only 10 EVP DAPs (6.62%) remaining differentially abundant long-term post-flight (Fig. 1c).

Specifically, 9 DAPs were shared between EVPs (5.96%) and plasma (22.5%) immediately post-flight (Fig. 1c). The 9 overlapping DAPs were Platelet factor 4 (PF4), Latent-transforming growth factor beta-binding protein 1 (LTBP1), Platelet factor 4 variant 1 (PF4V1), Alpha-synuclein (SNCA), Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2), Fibronectin 1 (FN1), Axin interactor, dorsalization associated (AIDA), Multimerin 1 (MMRN1), and Intercellular adhesion molecule 3 (ICAM3) (Fig. 1d). Of these, PRDX2 and SNCA increased, while ICAM3 decreased in both EVPs and plasma. Since PRDX2 is an antioxidant enzyme, its elevation in EVPs and plasma at R + 1 may indicate elevated oxidative stress. Increased SNCA level in the blood, including in EVPs, is a potential indicator of brain inflammation and stress. Also of note, ICAM3 downregulation may reflect impairments in T cell-Dendritic cell (T-DC) interactions and immune function, as ICAM3 is crucial for the initial interaction between these two immune cells. In addition, proteins associated with wound healing and coagulation, including PF4, PF4V1, and LTBP1, were increased in the plasma, but decreased in EVPs, potentially as a consequence of EVP capture in clots associated with spaceflight-induced thrombosis (Fig. 1d and Supplrmentary Fig. 1). However, PF4 and PF4V1 levels quickly returned to baseline, suggesting that the pro-thrombotic effect of spaceflight is temporary and reversible; these shifts of PF4 in plasma and EVPs were confirmed by ELISA (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).",

Interestingly, though individual DAPs mostly differed in plasma relative to EVPs, pathways enriched in these DAPs showed a consistent profile in plasma and EVPs. DAPs involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress, wound healing, coagulation, immune function, and hemostasis pathways were enriched in both plasma and EVP profiles (Fig. 1e, f). These findings indicate that the plasma secretome reflects the hematologic changes (hemostasis, wound healing, coagulation), immune response/inflammation changes, and molecular changes in ROS metabolism after the 3-day spaceflight. We also note the increased abundance of several proteins related to the complement pathway, such as FCN3 which remains upregulated even at R + 45. This was validated in EVPs by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2c).",

The lipid peroxidation cascade generates a number of different intermediates depending on the target lipid species. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the major byproducts of lipid peroxidation and widely used as a biomarker of oxidative stress. Therefore, to measure the overall lipid peroxidation in plasma, we quantified the levels of MDA adducts with thiobarbituric acid (TBA) using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance assay (TBARS assay) (Fig. 2e), which revealed that lipid peroxidation was significantly increased (p-value = 0.0013) immediately post-flight (R + 1) and returned to baseline levels after several weeks (R + 45).",

Specifically, ROS scavenging is dependent on ROOH and H2O2 detoxification via superoxide dismutase (SOD1, SOD2), catalase (CAT), and peroxiredoxins. Compared to ground controls, plasma from post-flight astronauts displayed an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and a distinct metabolic profile retained at both the immediate and long post-flight timepoints (Fig. 3a). Antioxidant proteins were also significantly enriched in EVPs in the intermediate post-flight timepoint, along with metabolic proteins involved in anabolic metabolism and cell growth, which may improve donor cells’ antioxidant capacity and cell bioenergetics. Our findings indicate the body upregulates the production of anabolic metabolism and antioxidants in the plasma and EVPs, especially in the immediate-post-flight timepoint, likely to compensate for increased ROS (Fig. 3a). At the longterm post-flight timepoint, these protein levels are abolished in the EVPs, but not in the plasma, which maintains an upregulation of antioxidant proteins and an altered metabolic profile. These data indicate that intracellular ROS levels and metabolic profiles can remain differentially abundant following spaceflight for at least 80 days after landing.",

Exposure to radiation, microgravity, and hypoxia during spaceflight all induce the production of free radicals leading to oxidative stress, which can impact on cardiovascular, immune, neurological, and metabolic systems. The ROS subnetwork from the i4 crew consisted of 26 nodes, including 6 proteins and 20 metabolites, with 38 correlation-based edges between the metabolites and proteins (Fig. 3c). All 6 proteins (100%) and 12 metabolites (60%) were lower post-flight, and 8 metabolites (40%) were higher post-flight. Within this subnetwork, three antioxidant enzymes from the peroxiredoxin family (PRDX1, PRDX2, PRDX6) which scavenge peroxides within cells, were increased immediately post-flight. In addition, three other enzymes that degrade ROS, namely SOD1, CAT and glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCLC), were also increased post-flight. SOD1 catalyzes the conversion of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide, which CAT can then degrade. GCLC is a rate-limiting enzyme for the de novo synthesis of glutathione, a widely studied antioxidant that maintains the cellular redox balance. Moreover, antioxidants, including inosine and taurine, were significantly increased immediately post-flight (q-value < 0.05). In addition to its antioxidant capacities, inosine dampens cytokine production, normally ameliorating inflammation. Taurine is also an antioxidant that protects immune cells during oxidative stress, and its upregulation suggests that immediate post-flight antioxidant production compensates for spaceflight-induced oxidative stress.",

Moreover, our analysis indicated that anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules, namely inosine, purines, and taurine, were increased immediately post-flight. While taurine and inosine are antioxidants, purines (e.g., adenosine) modulate the immune system by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radicals. In addition, 4-aminobutanoate (GABA), an immune-modulatory neurotransmitter, was also increased immediately post-flight, which can inhibit cytokine production.

Among the genes differentially abundant in EVPs and PBMCs, we noted several immune genes such as Integrin linked kinase (ILK), which was upregulated in EVPs and PBMCs, while carbonic anhydrase 8 (C8A) and complement C8 beta chain (C8B) were downregulated in EVPs and PBMCs (Fig. 4c).",

To disentangle the relationship between immune cells and the pathways enriched based on the secretome DAPs, we calculated the fold changes of normalized enrichment score (NES) of immune cells at R + 1 versus pre-flight for the significantly enriched secretome DAPs pathways related to coagulation, immune function, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, platelet activation, and reactive oxygen stress (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 3).

The increase in ITGB1 (CD29), which complexes with integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5, also CD49e), a heterodimer expressed on activated lymphocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), osteoblasts and which binds fibronectin and L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM, a central nervous system axonal protein), may be consistent with vascular permeability, and systemic inflammation.

PRDX2 increased in all crew members immediately post-flight (R + 1), while PRDX6 and SOD2 were decreased, and 2 proteoforms of catalase were increased in one crewmember after landing. A spaceflight mouse study also observed PRDX6 and catalase gene upregulation in skin samples, while a tail suspension rat study observed upregulation of PRDX6 in the hippocampus. Additional rodent studies have also shown changes in oxidative stress proteins (SOD1, SOD2, Xanthine oxidase, etc.) resulting from spaceflight factor exposure, both post-exposure and longterm. Thus, we propose that the oxidative stress induced by spaceflight triggers the production of both proteins and metabolites with antioxidant functions. Signs of hemolysis were also evident, underscored by an increase in circulating protoporphyrin, a known marker of this process. The observed decrease in S1P plasma abundance could also signal a reduction in erythrocytes, cells responsible for maintaining S1P concentrations in the blood. Our data further indicated lipid peroxidation, a biochemical process known to disrupt cellular membrane stability and decrease cell viability. Complementing these findings, we found an enrichment in anemia-related genes in our whole blood transcriptomics data and signs of coagulation dysregulation, often associated with anemia, in both EVPs and plasma proteomics. Indeed, spaceflight anemia has been previously observed and reported, consistent with our observations. Lastly, evidence of immune suppression was apparent. Aside from their roles as antioxidants, inosine and taurine possess immunoprotective properties. Along with the immunomodulatory metabolite GABA, these metabolites correlated with immune cell markers. Given that the abundance of these immune cell markers was low while immune modulatory metabolites were in high abundance, we hypothesize an activation of immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory responses after inflammation during the flight.",

            "text": "Our analysis of the i4 crew revealed a notable increase in several brain-associated proteins within both plasma and EVPs following spaceflight. Notably, SNCA was significantly increased in plasma, EVPs, and several immune cell types immediately after spaceflight, suggesting it represents a common protein marker of response to spaceflight. SNCA is associated with Parkinson’s disease, and elevated levels have been linked to brain dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, understanding these protein changes can guide the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for managing neurodegenerative diseases in space and on Earth. However, further investigations are necessary to better understand the precise mechanisms and implications of changes in brain-associated proteins as well as means to modify their levels safely.",

            "text": "Although these brain-associated proteins suggest some dysregulation of homeostasis in the brain, none of these proteins are unique to the brain, and thus it is possible that they may originate from other organs. Correlations between expression of these proteins in the brain and in the blood in response to spaceflight is required to confirm whether increased levels reflect dysregulation in the brain. However, a similar increase in brain-enriched transcripts/proteins was observed in JAXA Cell free epigenome (CFE) cfRNA (more than 120 days on the ISS), and the NASA Twins study EVP proteome, (1-year on the ISS) in-flight and immediately post-flight. We note that the amplitude and durability of changes in brain homeostasis and potential BBB disruption/neuroinflammation may be dictated by the length of time spent in space or distance from Earth. Previous reports of space flown mice on brain state have shown decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor, induced neuron atrophy in the cerebral cortex, and overall oxidative stress, regulated partially through c-Jun/c-Fos. Moreover, a recent MRI-based study of astronaut brains found that spaceflight induced ventricular expansion in the brain. Finally, increased hippocampal apoptosis and aquaporin-4 expression have been observed in other studies, along with significant increase in the expression of PECAM-1 and decreases in the BBB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Given the murine and human data observed to date, as well as data from this paper, PECAM-1 is a strong candidate as a BBB biomarker that could be measured in upcoming missions.",

            "text": "Overall, secretome profiling provides a minimally invasive, yet comprehensive approach to monitor crew health and physiology. Based on this work and follow-up studies, we propose to develop a liquid biopsy and biomarker panel to monitor space-associated health risk and link these to long-term work on countermeasures. Eventually such tools can generate reliable markers in response to spaceflight for more diverse populations (age, sex, health, background). Due to the limitation of the Dragon capsule equipment, we were unable to obtain in-flight secretome data for the i4 study, which would also be critical to study in the future. Additionally, creating more profiles from other crews and controls will help build a larger, more informative cohort, and further buttress and give context to the results seen in these data. Nonetheless, as human spaceflight becomes more prevalent, the necessity for deep secretome profiling can help establish baseline profiles for safer human space travel increases, and these tools can be part of the armamentarium of biomedical tools to help keep crews safe for upcoming, exploration-class missions, as well as continued health on Earth.",

In this network, proteins are depicted by ellipses, while metabolites are represented by square nodes. Edges between them signify significant correlation: a solid edge indicates a positive correlation, and a dotted edge signifies a negative one. The analysis considered differentially abundant proteins and metabolites that changed immediately post-flight (R + 1) compared to pre-flight (L-92, L-44, L-3) to compute these correlations. Furthermore, the color of each node reflects the log fold change of that node post-flight (R + 1).",

All mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26–28 °C and humidity of 30–70% with a 12 h light/dark cycle during the flight. This hardware has a housing density that is within the guidelines recommended by the National Institutes of Health. All mice were provided NASA Nutrient-upgraded Rodent Food Bar (NuRFB) and autoclaved deionized water ad libitum. Ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in the same flight hardware cages. Upon live return, mice were exsanguinated by closed-cardiac blood collection under deep Ketamine/Xylazine (150/45 mg/kg) anesthesia, followed by cervical dislocation as a secondary euthanasia method to ensure death. Their brains were removed and prepared for analysis. The left hemi-brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24 h, and then rinsed with PBS for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. The right hemi-brains were flash-frozen and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. GC mice were euthanized three days later. Animal experiments were approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) on October 14, 2021 (Protocol Number: RR-18), Roskamp Institute IACUC on October 7, 2021 (Protocol Number RR-18).",
