UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.",

Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-1, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared.",

Obscurin PK2 can phosphorylate N-cadherin in vitro. Obscurin PK1 has been shown to autophosphorylate several serines in the interkinase region immediately C-terminal of PK1. Deletion of both OBSC and Obsl1 in the skeletal muscle of mice results in changes in proteins implicated in metabolic pathways and the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC).

Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2.

These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer.

            "text": "During the course of this study, the recombinant production of UNC-89-PK2 samples compatible with viable phosphotransfer experimentation could not be established. Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases.",

By western blot, this KtoA mutation does not detectably affect the expression or stability of full-length UNC-89 isoforms (Fig. 1d) using an established antibody.

This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105) have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig26, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig39, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria.",

We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade.",

We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c).

Using a luciferase assay on whole worms, we were surprised to find that each mutant shows at least a 40% increase of ATP compared with wild type (Fig. 7). However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm). The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions.",

UCPs are a family of transporters that permit proton movement back into the mitochondrial matrix, and some UCPs are involved in generating heat. Thus, uncoupling should result in less ATP production, and the observed increase in ATP is likely due to increased glycolysis (Fig. 9). Mammals express 5 UCP proteins, but C. elegans express only a single UCP, called UCP-4. Nematode UCP-4 is primarily expressed in the body wall and pharyngeal muscles. We wished to explore the possibility that the level of UCP-4 is altered in the PK2 KtoA mutants. We created a CRISPR/Cas9 strain in which UCP-4 has an HA tag at its C-terminus, and this strain was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). As shown in Fig. 10, the level of UCP-4 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in PK2 KtoA mutants. The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants, but why UCP-4 levels are increased awaits further study.",

This strain and wild type, as day 1 adult animals, were heat-shocked at 30° for 2 h, and then immunostained using anti-ATP5A to image the mitochondria. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10a, although mitochondria from the wild type showed the expected linear/tubular organization, mitochondria from the strain expressing the PK2 fragment showed more clumping. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 10b, heat shock of this extra PK2 did not change the total level of DRP-1, but as shown in Supplementary Fig. 10c, it decreased the level of DRP-1 associated with mitochondria.",

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to create worms that express UNC-89 isoforms with catalytically inactive PK2 protein kinase domains and we observed an unexpected and specific phenotype. In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased. Thus, it seems that the effect of PK2 KtoA mutation both increases and decreases mitochondrial function. The observed increase in glycolysis might be a compensatory response to altered mitochondrial respiration.",

The conserved GTPase Drp1 is required for mitochondrial fragmentation, and in mammals, this occurs by recruitment of Drp1 to the outer membrane by adaptors, then oligomerization, recruitment of dynamin 2, and membrane scission. We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity.",

The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade. Moreover, more uncoupling means that mitochondria produce less ATP, and thus elevated ATP levels in PK2 KtoA mutants are most likely due to increased glycolysis.",

Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance.",

In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al. demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside.",

However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission. Feng et al. reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.",

To detect UNC-89 proteins, we separated the protein lysate on a 3% stacking and 5% separating Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h, and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:400 dilution, followed by reaction with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. Western blots to detect DRP-1 were used in three types of experiments. First, to check the specificity of anti-DRP-1 antibodies, equal quantities of total protein lysates from wild type and drp-1(tm1108) were separated on a 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted against affinity-purified anti-DRP-1 at 1:200 dilution which had been pre-absorbed against an acetone powder of E. coli OP50 to reduce or eliminate reaction to bacterial proteins. Second, we used a similar approach to compare the levels of DRP-1 in total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Third, we compared the level of DRP-1 from total worm mitochondria from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Preparation of total worm mitochondria by differential centrifugation was conducted as described below in the section on purifying muscle mitochondria. We also performed western blots to compare the levels of representative components of electron chain complexes from total protein lysates. Antibodies and concentrations were: complex I, mouse monoclonal to NDUFS3 (Abcam cat. no. ab14711) at 1:2,500 dilution; complex II, rabbit anti-SDHA (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 11998 P) at 1:500 dilution; complex IV, mouse monoclonal to MTCO1 (Abcam cat. no. ab14705) at 1:2000 dilution; complex V, mouse monoclonal to ATP5A (Abcam cat. no. ab147481) at 1:5000 dilution; and mouse monoclonal to cytochrome C (Abcam cat. no. ab110325) at 1:1000 dilution. Finally, we performed western blots to measure the level of UCP-4-HA in wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) backgrounds using anti-HA (rabbit monoclonal cat. no. C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000 dilution. Before use, the optimal dilutions of each antibody were determined to yield linear detection of the proteins. Protein bands were quantitated by comparing to scans of Ponceau S staining of a gel lane on the blot. The uncropped and unedited blot images used to prepare Figs. 1d, 6a–c, 8c, 10a, and Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, are shown respectively in Supplementary Figs. 12–16.",

The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation with modifications (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296, sfIs21[myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP]. sfIs21 was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and into drp-1(tm1108), to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a major conformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound. Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a fluorescent read-out of this conformation. An ATP to ADP ratio is proportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults were immobilized for imaging without drugs using a combination of a PDMS microfluidic device with channels just large enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F127. The microfluidic devices were kindly manufactured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Aqueous solutions of Pluronic F127 are fluid at 4°, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created by dividing the emissions, Em 488/Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images, the total number of pixels with intensity greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations were calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain.",

Briefly, for each strain, we harvested a mixed-stage population of nematodes from 2, 15 cm, high peptone plates seeded with E. coli strain NA22. Worms were washed free from bacteria by at least 3 washes of M9 buffer, followed by 2 washes with deionized water. The worm pellets were resuspended in 3.5 mls of ice-cold Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer (MIB; 50 mM KCl, 110 mM mannitol, 70 mM sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5 mM Tris pH 7.4 without protease inhibitors) and transferred to a 7 ml Dounce homogenizer. While on ice, we brought the pestle up and down 25 times. The homogenate was transferred to 3, 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes, and spun in a microfuge at 4° for 5 min at 200 × g. The resulting supernatant was transferred to 3 fresh tubes, and centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. This supernatant was then centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The pellets from all 3 Eppendorf tubes were resuspended in a final volume of 600 μl of ice-cold PEB (PBS, 2 mM EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, without protease inhibitors). To this suspension was added 30 μl of a suspension of anti-HA magnetic beads (Pierce, cat. no. 88836), and the tube placed on a rotating wheel at 4° for one hour. The beads were then pulled out of the solution using a tube stand containing neodymium magnets (Millipore Corporation), and then the beads were washed twice with 1 ml of PEB, and then resuspended in 50–100 μl of MIB and kept on ice.",

Complex I substrates (10 mM glutamate, and 2 mM malate) or complex II substrates (7 mM succinate) were added in addition to 1.2 mM ADP to stimulate basal respiration. Uncoupled respiration was measured with the addition of 80 nM FCCP (Carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption was assessed with the addition of potassium cyanide (500 μM). To assess mitochondrial respiration, the non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was subtracted from the total oxygen consumption rate.",

UNC-89 contains two protein kinase domains, PK1 and PK2, separated by an elastic region. Here we show that PK2 is a canonical kinase expected to be catalytically active. C. elegans expressing UNC-89 with a lysine to alanine (KtoA) mutation to inactivate PK2 have normally organized sarcomeres and SR, and normal muscle function. PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria, correlated with more mitochondrially-associated DRP-1. PK2 KtoA mutants have increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis and altered levels of electron transport chain complexes. Muscle mitochondria show increased complex I and decreased complex II basal respiration, each of which cannot be uncoupled. This suggests that mutant mitochondria are already uncoupled, possibly resulting from an increased level of the uncoupling protein, UCP-4. Our results suggest signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria, to help match energy requirements with energy production.",

            "text": "Loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans gene unc-89 result in slow-moving worms with disorganized muscle sarcomeres, including a lack of M-lines. unc-89 is a complex gene, which utilizes three promoters and alternative splicing to generate at least 16 polypeptides, ranging in size from 156,000 to 900,000 Da (WormBase). Overlapping sets of isoforms are expressed in body wall muscle, pharyngeal muscle (for pumping in and grinding up bacterial food), egg-laying and intestinal muscles, and several gonadal epithelial cells. The largest of these isoforms, UNC-89-B, consists of 53 Ig domains, two Fn3 domains, a triplet of SH3, DH, and PH domains near their N-termini, and two protein kinase domains (PK1 and PK2) near their C termini. Antibodies localize UNC-89 to the M-line. To learn how UNC-89 is localized and performs its functions, we have screened a yeast two-hybrid library with segments of the largest UNC-89 isoform and identified at least 7 interacting partners with 6 out of 7 having orthologs or homologs in humans. Interactions were verified by a combination of in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins, co-immunolocalization, and analysis of muscle mutant phenotypes. Two types of protein phosphatases interact with the protein kinase region of UNC-89. Segments containing either of the kinase domains, Fn1-Ig52-PK1 and Ig53-Fn2-PK2, interact with SCPL-1, a CTD-type protein phosphatase. The segment, Ig53-Fn2, which lies just the N-terminal of PK2, interacts with PPTR-2, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A). Although we do not know the substrates for UNC-89 kinases, or SCPL-1 and PP2A phosphatases, it could be envisioned that some of the substrates might be shared.",

Referencing the UNC-89-PK2 sequence to these other kinases reveals a high conservation of catalytically relevant motifs in PK2. Specifically, canonical kinases are characterized by a glycine-rich GxGxxG loop motif involved in ATP-binding, an AAK motif in β-strand β3 containing an essential lysine (that optimally positions the non-transferable α- and β-phosphate groups of ATP), a conserved glutamate residue in helix C that forms a salt bridge with the essential lysine during the catalytically committed state of the kinase, a DFG signature motif (where the aspartate residue chelates the magnesium ion required for catalysis), a catalytic aspartate and a conserved asparagine residue (also involved in cation coordination), both in the catalytic loop motif. These groups are conserved in UNC-89-PK2 (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). A minor variation is present only in the glycine-rich motif, which in UNC-89-PK2 adopts the sequence FxGxxS. In fact, this motif is commonly diversified across obscurin and UNC-89 PK2 kinases across phyla (Supplementary Fig. 2). Degeneration of the first and last positions of this motif is common among kinases and is known not to compromise ATP-binding or phosphotransfer. For example, the active kinases CDK11, TP53RK, and mouse obscurin PK2 contain ExGxxG, KxGxxA, and RxGxxS motif variants, respectively.",

Thus, in order to further investigate whether a phosphor-transfer productive conformation is attainable by UNC-89-PK2, we calculated its 3D model using AlphaFold and tested in silico its capability of accommodating ATP/Mg2+ (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a). In kinases, the mutual arrangement of N- and C-terminal fold lobes, the position of the ATP-binding glycine-rich loop, the orientation of the catalytic helix αC hosting the conserved glutamate residue that coordinates the magnesium counterion, the conformation of the activation loop that governs access to the catalytic aspartate at the peptide binding site, the conformation of the conserved DFG-motif, and the assembly state of two dynamic structural networks of hydrophobic residues termed spines, is dynamically altered to achieve catalytic readiness. Nucleotide binding to the kinase normally induces the formation of the catalytically committed state. Distinctly, DMT kinases exist in a catalytically-primed state in the absence of ATP-binding, which does not induce a further conformational rearrangement. In agreement with this existent knowledge, the 3D model of UNC-89-PK2 displayed a regular kinase fold with features typical of the catalytically-primed conformational state of a kinase (Fig. 1a, b). At the residue level, the ATP-binding lysine K7816 is modeled forming a typical salt bridge to the conserved glutamic acid E7827 in the catalytic helix αC. The canonical DFG-motif (residues 7921-7923) is modeled in the “in”-conformation and the activation loop is in an open state. Both the regulatory (R)-spine (residues L7831, L7842, H7899 and F7922) and the catalytic (C-)spine (I7799, A7814, V7863, I7907, M7908, F7909, V7965 and L7969) are assembled. The modeled structure of UNC-89-PK2 closely resembles that of human DAPK1 and was also compatible with its ATP/Mg2+ binding mode (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3b). Thus, we conclude that UNC-89-PK2 shares the sequence and conformational features of established canonical kinases.",

This report prompted us to examine the morphology and function of mitochondria in UNC-89 KtoA mutants. Using an antibody to the mitochondrial inner membrane protein ATP5A, and identifying the body wall muscle cells using antibodies to UNC-95, we found that mitochondria in wild-type muscle are organized into long wavy chains, parallel to the sarcomeric A- and I-bands (Fig. 4a), as reported by others. In comparison, mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) appear fragmented. This can be seen by confocal (Fig. 4a) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) (Fig. 4b). In contrast, nematodes expressing the related giant protein twitchin with a catalytically dead protein kinase domain, unc-22(sf21), or twitchin with a missense mutation in Ig7, unc-22(e105) have normally organized mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 7). This suggests that effects on mitochondrial morphology are specific for UNC-89 PK2 and not a function shared by protein kinases of the other giant muscle proteins in the worm. We find similar abnormal fragmented morphology of the mitochondria in unc-89(tm752) animals, which lack expression of all kinase-containing isoforms, but do express other isoforms(Fig. 4a). In contrast, a more normal (wild type) morphology of mitochondria is seen in two other unc-89 mutants: unc-89(e1460)—a stop codon in an alternatively spliced exon for Ig20-Ig26, which expresses kinase-containing isoforms; and in unc-89(su75)—a frameshift mutation in the exon for Ig39, that lacks expression of all giant isoforms but expresses the small kinase-containing isoforms (Fig. 4a, b). Our impressions of mitochondrial morphology are supported by a quantitative analysis of the SIM images (Supplementary Fig. 8): binning the mitochondria for length indicates that unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(tm752) have no mitochondria >10 μm, and fewer mitochondria between 5 and 10 μm as compared to either wild type or unc-89(e1460). Therefore, either inactivation of PK2 kinase or lack of expression of PK2-containing isoforms results in fragmented mitochondria.",

We find that the drp-1(tm1108) mutant produces large clumped mitochondria as reported previously(Fig. 5b), and that an unc-89(sf22); drp-1(tm1108) double mutant shows the Drp-1 phenotype, i.e., drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22). The epistasis of drp-1 over sf22 indicates that the fragmentation of mitochondria in unc-89(sf22) requires DRP-1 protein. One possibility is that UNC-89 PK2 may be an inhibitor of DRP-1 activity, and DRP-1 may be more active when PK2 has no catalytic activity. This further suggests that DRP-1 protein could be a target of the protein kinase activity of UNC-89 PK2, directly or indirectly through a kinase cascade.",

We developed an antibody to DRP-1 and validated the antibody by showing that it detects a protein of expected size from wild type (~80 kDa), but no protein is detectable from a drp-1 deletion mutant (Fig. 6a). We observed no differences in the total levels of DRP-1 between wild type and either of two unc-89 PK2 KtoA mutants (unc-89(sf22) or unc-89(syb1360)) (Fig. 6b). However, we found an approximately two-fold higher level of DRP-1 associated with purified mitochondria from either of the PK2 mutants compared to wild type (Fig. 6c).

However, unc-89 is expressed only in the body wall, pharyngeal, vulval and intestinal muscle, and a few myoepithelial cells of the oviduct. Thus, we utilized a method to assess ATP levels primarily in the body wall muscle, the major site of UNC-89 expression. The ATP:ADP ratio, is a sensitive indicator of cellular energy status. The fluorescent biosensor PercevalHR can measure this ratio in living cells. The ATP:ADP ratio is proportional to fluorescence at 529 nm at two excitation wavelengths (405 and 488 nm). The myo-3 gene, which encodes myosin heavy chain A (MHC A), is primarily expressed in body wall muscle but is also expressed in a few single sarcomere muscle cells and in a few myoepithelial cells of the gonadal sheath. We created transgenic worms that express PercevalHR primarily in body wall muscle using the myo-3 promoter. We first validated the technique by showing: (i) the ATP:ADP ratio is decreased in animals treated with antimycin A (inhibits complex III) (Supplementary Fig. 9a, c), and (ii) the ATP/ADP ratio is decreased in drp-1(tm1108) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with a report that drp-1 mutants have decreased ATP levels. The ATP/ADP ratio is increased in unc-89(sf22) (Supplementary Fig. 9b, d), consistent with the increased levels of ATP in the whole animals (Fig. 7). Although most of these results do not reach the level of statistical significance, they do show trends consistent with our tentative conclusions.",

In contrast to all previously described unc-89 loss of function mutants, these worms have normal sarcomere and SR structures and move faster than the wild type. In addition, PK2 KtoA mutants have fragmented mitochondria. Although mitochondrial fragmentation is usually associated with decreased mitochondrial function, we found that ATP levels were increased and complex I basal respiration was increased and was already uncoupled, and there was no obvious increase in complex I proteins. Nevertheless, complex II basal respiration was decreased and the level of complex II was decreased.

We found that there is more DRP-1 associated with mitochondria of PK2 KtoA mutants, thus explaining the higher degree of fragmentation. Conversely, increasing the level of wild-type PK2 by transgenic overexpression increases mitochondrial clumping and decreases DRP-1 associated with mitochondria. The association of Drp1 is known to be regulated by phosphorylation in a complex manner, some phosphorylation sites promoting association, others inhibiting it. Our finding that genetically drp-1 is epistatic to unc-89(sf22) is consistent with the DRP-1 protein being a direct or indirect target of UNC-89 PK2 protein kinase activity.",

The higher level of UCP-4 likely explains the uncoupled state of PK2 KtoA mutants; however, how this occurs awaits further experiments. One possibility is that the expression, stability, or activity of UCP-4 is regulated by phosphorylation, which also may occur by PK2 or a PK2 kinase cascade.

Unfortunately, during the course of this study, we were unsuccessful in producing recombinant PK2 samples suitable for in vitro phosphotransfer experimentation. Nonetheless, the phenotype of PK2 KtoA mutants suggests the existence of a signaling pathway between the sarcomere, where UNC-89 is located, and mitochondria. Such communication would help match the energy requirements of muscle contraction with energy production by mitochondria. In mammalian striated muscle, large quantities of ATP are required to fuel sarcomere contraction and the ionic pumps that drive muscle contraction, and most of this ATP is supplied by numerous mitochondria. There is very close packing of organelles in striated muscle and the spaces between adjacent myofibril/SR/T-tubule cylinders are filled with mitochondria. There is a complex 3D network of mitochondria in mammalian skeletal muscle, mostly in the form of fused or elongated mitochondria. This organization likely ensures rapid and efficient transfer of ATP to the contractile apparatus. It is believed that during muscle contraction, calcium ions, and ATP are released into a privileged microdomain and taken up into myofibrils before they have time to diffuse beyond the myofibrils. Because of the close proximity of mitochondria to sarcomeres, even in C. elegans muscle, and the need to match energetic output to contractile demands, we speculate that there is signaling from sarcomeres to mitochondria that coordinate the structural organization and metabolic activity of mitochondria, and this is essential for optimal muscle performance.",

In a remarkably sophisticated study using Drosophila, Avellaneda et al. demonstrated that there is communication between mitochondria and myofibrils during muscle development. Drosophila have two types of muscle, fibrillar, exemplified by indirect flight muscle in which individual myofibrils are not laterally aligned with their neighbors, and body muscles such as in the legs in which myofibrils are aligned laterally to form a tube. The morphology and organization of mitochondria are different in these muscle types. In indirect flight muscle, the mitochondria are elongated and lie between the myofibrils, whereas in leg muscle the mitochondria lie mostly within the tube and peripherally. When Avellaneda et al. overexpressed a mitofusin homolog required for mitochondrial fusion or expressed a dominant negative Drp1 required for fission, the morphology of indirect flight muscle resembled leg muscle with myofibrils aligned laterally and often forming tubes and mitochondria located inside.",

            "text": "Increased mitochondrial fragmentation has been linked to a reduction in mitochondrial function. However, some studies suggest that mitochondrial fragmentation is not always associated with decreased function and may be beneficial. For example, in rat gastrocnemius muscle, resistance exercise resulted in an increase in activated Drp1 (Drp1 phosphorylated at serine 616), suggesting activation of mitochondrial fission. Feng et al. reported that in rats during early exercise, there was increased expression of the fission mediator Fis1. A more definitive study was reported on heart muscle. After exercising mice for 1 h, the authors found that mitochondria were fragmented, total Drp1 and activated Drp1 were increased, oxidative stress was not increased, mitochondrial membrane potential was maintained, pro-mitophagy proteins decreased, and mitochondrial respiration was increased. Their conclusion is that mitochondrial fragmentation associated with increased mitochondrial function is part of the normal cardiac response to increased energetic demand encountered during normal levels of exercise. Our findings in C. elegans striated muscle—that a kinase-dead version of UNC-89 results in mitochondrial fragmentation but increased respiration and ATP levels—are consistent with this report on exercised mouse heart.",

To detect UNC-89 proteins, we separated the protein lysate on a 3% stacking and 5% separating Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h, and reacted with anti-UNC-89 EU30 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies at 1:400 dilution, followed by reaction with anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. Western blots to detect DRP-1 were used in three types of experiments. First, to check the specificity of anti-DRP-1 antibodies, equal quantities of total protein lysates from wild type and drp-1(tm1108) were separated on a 10% Laemmli SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and reacted against affinity-purified anti-DRP-1 at 1:200 dilution which had been pre-absorbed against an acetone powder of E. coli OP50 to reduce or eliminate reaction to bacterial proteins. Second, we used a similar approach to compare the levels of DRP-1 in total protein lysates from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Third, we compared the level of DRP-1 from total worm mitochondria from wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360). Preparation of total worm mitochondria by differential centrifugation was conducted as described below in the section on purifying muscle mitochondria. We also performed western blots to compare the levels of representative components of electron chain complexes from total protein lysates. Antibodies and concentrations were: complex I, mouse monoclonal to NDUFS3 (Abcam cat. no. ab14711) at 1:2,500 dilution; complex II, rabbit anti-SDHA (Cell Signaling, cat. no. 11998 P) at 1:500 dilution; complex IV, mouse monoclonal to MTCO1 (Abcam cat. no. ab14705) at 1:2000 dilution; complex V, mouse monoclonal to ATP5A (Abcam cat. no. ab147481) at 1:5000 dilution; and mouse monoclonal to cytochrome C (Abcam cat. no. ab110325) at 1:1000 dilution. Finally, we performed western blots to measure the level of UCP-4-HA in wild type, unc-89(sf22) and unc-89(syb1360) backgrounds using anti-HA (rabbit monoclonal cat. no. C29F4 from Cell Signaling Technology) at 1:1000 dilution. Before use, the optimal dilutions of each antibody were determined to yield linear detection of the proteins. Protein bands were quantitated by comparing to scans of Ponceau S staining of a gel lane on the blot. The uncropped and unedited blot images used to prepare Figs. 1d, 6a–c, 8c, 10a, and Supplementary Fig. 10b, c, are shown respectively in Supplementary Figs. 12–16.",

Fixation and phalloidin-rhodamine staining were conducted as described in ref. . To visualize mitochondria, we used mouse monoclonal antibody (15H4C4) also at 1:200 dilution (Abcam cat. no. ab14748). For pharyngeal muscle imaging, the fixed adult day 1 worms were incubated with anti-UNC-89 (EU30) at 1:100, and anti-myosin heavy chain C (MHC C; mouse monoclonal 9.2.1) at 1:100. Secondary antibodies, used at 1:200 dilution, included anti-rabbit Alexa 488, and anti-mouse Alexa 594, all purchased from Invitrogen. Confocal images were captured at room temperature with a Zeiss confocal system (LSM510) equipped with an Axiovert 100 M microscope and an Apochromat x63/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective, in 1× and 2.5× zoom mode.

The resulting plasmid, myo-3p::PercevalHR at 10 ng/ml, was co-injected into worms together with the transformation marker plasmid lin-44p::GFP at 90 ng/ml, into wild-type worms, and transgenic animals were selected on the basis of GFP expression in the worm tail. The extrachromosomal array was then integrated randomly into the genome by ultraviolet irradiation with modifications (Peter Barrett, personal communication), to create strain GB296, sfIs21[myo-3p::PercevalHR; lin-44p::GFP]. sfIs21 was crossed into unc-89(sf22) and into drp-1(tm1108), to create strains GB355 and GB356, respectively. PercevalHR is based on GlnK1 which undergoes a major conformational change depending on whether ATP or ADP is bound. Coupling of GlnK1 to mVenus creates a fluorescent read-out of this conformation. An ATP to ADP ratio is proportional to emission at 533 nm upon excitation at 405 nm and 488 nm. Day 1 transgenic adults were immobilized for imaging without drugs using a combination of a PDMS microfluidic device with channels just large enough to accommodate adult worms and Pluronic F127. The microfluidic devices were kindly manufactured and provided by Gongchen Sun from the Hang Lu laboratory at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Aqueous solutions of Pluronic F127 are fluid at 4°, and solid at room temperature. Body wall muscle was excited with a laser at 405 and at 488 nm using an Olympus FV1000 inverted confocal microscope. Ratiometric images of body wall muscle were created by dividing the emissions, Em 488/Em 405. Using Fiji software on these images, the total number of pixels with intensity greater than 100 were counted, and the means and standard deviations were calculated from multiple body wall muscle cells from 5 animals of each strain.",
