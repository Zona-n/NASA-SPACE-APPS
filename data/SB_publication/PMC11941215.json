In this study, we aimed to determine the levels of inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days. C57BL/6 mice were launched to the ISS as part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft from 21 September 2014 to 25 October 2014. Dissected mouse brains from that mission were analyzed by immunoblotting of inflammasome signaling proteins and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA) for inflammatory cytokine levels. Our data indicate decreased inflammasome activation in the brains of mice that were housed in the ISS for 37 days when compared to the brains of mice that were maintained on the ground, and in mice corresponding to the baseline group that were sacrificed at the time of launching of SpaceX-4. Moreover, we did not detect any significant changes in the expression levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12p70 and IL-10 between the ground control and the flight groups. Together, these studies suggest that spaceflight results in a decrease in the levels of innate immune signaling molecules that govern inflammasome signaling in the brain of mice.",

These environmental factors include gravity changes, radiation exposure, altered nutrition or altered circadian rhythms, all of which affect the immune response. Dysregulation of the immune response has two-fold consequences for astronauts. First, it has the potential to jeopardize the mission while in space, and it causes long-term detrimental consequences, not just while they are in space, but also once they return to Earth. Therefore, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of how the immune response is altered by space flight.",

The inflammasome plays a significant role in the regulation of the inflammatory response by modulating the innate immune response through the activation of caspase-1, the processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, as well as the programmed cell death mechanism of pyroptosis. The inflammasome has been shown to contribute to a variety of diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, inflammaging and metabolic syndrome. Several of these diseases, with an inflammasome etiology, have also been suggested to be relevant in the context of space flight such as the development of dementia, altered aging and inflammation or diabetes. Hence, it is important to understand the effects of space flight on inflammasome signaling to develop therapies against specific targets of the immune response to protect and improve the performance of astronauts not only during a mission, but also their health on Earth.",

            "text": "It has been shown that space radiation affects hippocampus-dependent cognitive tasks, spatial navigation and episodic memory formation, which is very important for the overall health of astronauts. In addition, it has been suggested that space radiation affects the cortex and causes altered cognitive flexibility and synaptic plasticity, which contribute to cognitive deficits. A recent study used the anti-oxidant LGM2605 to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in an in vitro model of lung vascular networks that were exposed to γ-rays and mixed-field radiation sources to mimic some of the space flight conditions in vitro. The study found that 3–4 keV/µm and 8–10 keV/µm linear energy transfer (LET) proton radiation elevated the levels of NLRP3, and that this increase can be targeted with anti-oxidant approaches. In this study, we aimed to characterize the effect of space flight on the expression of inflammasome proteins and inflammatory cytokines in mice that were part of NASA’s Rodent Research 1 Mission (RR-1) on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 Dragon cargo spacecraft that spent 37 to 38 days at the International Space Station (ISS).",

On 24 September, the temperature stabilized between 21 and 23 °C. Importantly, mice in the ISS (flight group) and in the ground control group experienced the same temperature conditions. Overall, the lowest temperature in the ISS during RR-1 was 18.50 °C and the highest temperature was 26.80 °C, with a mean temperature of 22.76 °C, whereas in the ground control group, the lowest temperature was 18.30 °C and the maximum was 27.10 °C (mean temperature 22.76 °C). Moreover, telemetry data indicated that mice in the flight group experienced initial higher CO2 levels at around 2621 ppm on 20 September, whereas mice in the ground group experienced much lower CO2 levels at approximately 476 ppm. By 27 September, both groups of mice experienced similar CO2 conditions through the rest of the flight, approximately between 1868 ppm and 4690 ppm. The minimum CO2 level in the ISS group was 1862 ppm and the maximum was 4667 ppm (mean 3197.27, median 3192 ppm), whereas in the ground group, the minimum was 438 ppm, the maximum was 4690 ppm and the mean was 2853.74. The median was 3188 ppm. Moreover, by October 25th, mice in the ISS experienced an accumulated radiation dose of 7.17 mGy/day. In the ISS group, the minimum galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) dose was 0.13 mGy/day, and the maximum was 0.14 mGy/day (mean 0.13 mGy/day). Furthermore, the radiation experienced as a result of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) ranged between 0.06 and 0.10 mGy/day (mean 0.07 mGy/day). Together, these accounted for a minimum total dose of 0.19 mGy/day, a maximum of 0.23 mGy/day and an average of 0.20 mGy/day.",

However, how space flight affects the inflammatory response mediated by the inflammasome in the brain of mice has yet to be fully understood. In this study, we determined the levels of the key inflammasome signaling proteins caspase-1, ASC and IL-1β in the brain of mice after a stay of 37 days on the ISS. In addition, we measured the levels of cytokines that contribute significantly to the inflammatory response in the brain such as TNF-α, IL-10, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-12p70. We used immunoblotting and ECLIA approaches to determine the inflammatory protein profile in the brains of mice that were in the ISS as part of the RR-1 mission that was launched on SpaceX-4 CRS-4 on 21 September 2014 and returned to earth on October 25th of the same year.

However, approximately a week later, mice in both groups experienced similar CO2 conditions. Increased CO2 levels in neutrophils for a couple of hours have been shown to increase IL-1β as well as the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 without affecting the levels of ASC. Thus, it is possible that the changes seen between the ground control group and the flight group are due to the fluctuations in the CO2 levels. Furthermore, another variable that needs to be taken into account is that there was a difference between the vivarium group and the ground control group, bringing up the possibility of an effect due to the habitat. Notably, the CO2 levels in the vivarium group were the same as ambient air (~419 ppm), which were much lower than the ground group (median: 3188 ppm). In addition, some differences have been described between the vivarium and the animal enclosure module in which water and food consumption were higher in the animal enclosure module without a significant effect on overall body mass but some differences in the weight of certain organs were reported; however, that study did not report the weight of the brain. Alternatively, taken together, it is possible that the effects seen in the flight group are in part due to the effects of the CO2 levels in the brain and the stress associated with space flight. Therefore, part of the elevated levels seen in the ground control group compared to the vivarium group may be due in part to the habitat environment and the CO2 levels. Importantly, the CO2 levels between the ground and the flight groups eventually stabilized after 7 days (ISS median: 3192 ppm; ground median: 3188 ppm).",

Previous studies have shown that whole body exposure to higher doses from a 137CsCl radiation source (0.5 to 4 Gy) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in inflammasome activation as determined by the cleavage of caspase-1 at 1 day after exposure, an effect that was not present at 1 and 4 h; moreover, caspase-1 cleavage was significantly decreased by day 14 in immune cells. Following this radiation protocol, inflammasome activation was mainly identified in macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells. In addition, UV radiation has been shown to also activate inflammasomes. Furthermore, it has been shown that exposure of mice to silicon (0.5 Gy) or iron (0.15 Gy) ions results in increased cytokine production that is associated with infiltration of immune cells. A recent study in a model of the lung vascular network exposed to low levels of radiation ranging from 0.25 to 1 Gy showed increased expression of the inflammasome sensor NLRP3, which was decreased by treatment with LGM2605, a scavenger of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and active chlorine species (ACS), which is capable of reducing ionizing species due to radiation. Similarly, in a study using a clinostat to model microgravity (10−3 gravitational force) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the authors showed that microgravity also increased the expression of NLRP3 consistent with increased expression of IL-1β and increased stress in the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, a recent study showed that 8 Gy of radiation can inhibit activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages exposed to ATP and LPS by a mechanism that involves inhibiting TWIK2 expression. However, whether the 7.17 mGy/day of accumulated radiation is also capable of causing lower levels of inflammasome protein expression experienced by mice in the flight group is yet to be tested.",

Interestingly, the levels of these proteins were similar to those levels present in the brains of the animals corresponding to the baseline group, which were sacrificed at the time of launch, suggesting that the inflammasome proteins continued to increase over time in the ground control group; however, this increase in inflammasome protein expression was arrested or stalled in the ISS group. We have previously shown that inflammasome activation in the brain increases as part of the inflammaging response. In contrast to those inflammaging studies, the brain data from the mice in RR1 presented lower levels of these inflammasome proteins similar to those levels that were present in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch. These data would suggest that the innate immune response mediated by the inflammasome is not weakened by space flight, but that it does not develop as it normally does on Earth. Consistent with these findings on decreased inflammation in the Central Nervous System (CNS), animals in RR-1 have also been shown to present younger epigenetic age in the retina than the ground control group. Similarly, in the NASA Twin Study, the spaceflight twin presented a longer telomere length than his twin brother who remained on Earth, suggesting that in space, the aging process is slowed down.

Thus, it is possible that the stress of exposure associated with radiation and microgravity in the ISS mice resulted in stalled replication forks responsible for regulating inflammasome expression in the brain, which ultimately is responsible for the levels of inflammasome activation in the brain similar to those seen in mice that were sacrificed at the time of launch (baseline group).",

However, in this study, we have measured the inflammatory response in the CNS, suggesting that the immune response mounted in the brain as a result of space flight differs between the CNS and the periphery, an effect that is perhaps due to the relatively immune-privileged status of the brain owing to the characteristics of the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, similar observations have been previously reported in which spaceflight conditions resulted in immune dysfunctions and dysregulated inflammation. Future studies are needed to confirm these results in other missions. However, consistent with these results, a previous study in the brain of mice that were in the ISS for 35 days and were flown on board SpaceX-12 as part of RR9 showed downregulation of immune genes. Furthermore, in this study, only female mice were used. Thus, future studies are needed to better understand the sex differences associated with space flight in the inflammatory response in the brain, considering that previous studies have shown that brain cells respond differently in males vs. females to space-related radiation conditions. Another limitation of this study is the low sample size characteristic of this type of space biology studies. In addition, although the trends are similar across different brain areas, it is not clear what areas of the brain are included in those that did not include the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, since we have only analyzed samples from RR-1, we were not able to compare the results of RR-1 to other missions. Thus, we do not know if the results of this study could be generalized to space flight in general or if these findings are particular to events/conditions that took place during the RR-1 mission. Future, studies should aim at analyzing mouse brains from other missions with larger sample sizes, as well as studies with more accurately described dissected brain areas, and with considerations for sex differences. Furthermore, it would be important to compare these findings in the rodent brain to blood-based biomarkers obtained from astronauts in missions of different durations.",
