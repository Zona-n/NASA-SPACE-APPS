            "text": "The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1−/− mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1−/− mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/− mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1−/− mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1−/− mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.",

Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages, and dendritic cells as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac). Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen, and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars. ",

            "text": "Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones and adhesion molecules. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues, expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation or as part of microbial walls, and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages and sinusoidal endothelium, which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells.

The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate (1) the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and (2) the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fed Mrc1−/− and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.",

On the other hand, macrophages identified as Gr-1−CD115−F4/80+SSClow decreased in the bone marrow of Mrc1-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Figure 1V,X). This last trait was commonly associated with compromised retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the niche, often as the consequence of altered crosstalk between the stem cell niche and adipocytes within the bone marrow during hematopoiesis. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the content of adipocytes in the bone marrow of Mrc1−/− mice to control mice using Perilipin as an adipocyte marker with immunofluorescence staining (Figure 1Y). Adipocyte content significantly increased in association with Mrc1 deficiency both in terms of cells per area and absolute count (Figure 1Z,AA). The observation of a similar value for adipocyte cell surface area between the experimental groups (Figure 1AB) suggests that an investigation of differences in bone marrow adipogenesis is required to explain the phenotype described above. Altogether, the decreased presence of macrophages, the combination of reduced levels of myeloid precursors and mature cells, and the increased adipocyte content suggest that the lack of Mrc1 could promote a medullary rewiring in mice with diet-induced obesity. This medullary rewiring is reflected in changes to the circulating immune subsets and systemic inflammatory status.",

To better characterize this phenotype, differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways in the plasma of Mrc1−/− mice compared to that of WT mice (Figure 2D). Interestingly, ECM-receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial migration, chemokine signaling pathway, and platelet activation (FDR < 0.05) displayed a higher number of downregulated proteins (Figure 2E,F) in the plasma from Mrc1−/− mice.

This difference was not the result of changes in visceral adipose tissue or subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, significant differences were observed in the relative weight of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver (Figure 4C). Nonetheless, the moderate impact of these differences in explaining the reduction of animal weight suggests that Mrc1 deficiency in mice fed an HFD might affect other tissues that were not evaluated in our work. This limitation should be addressed in future studies. Notably, the adipocyte area was not different in the VAT or SCAT from Mrc1−/− and WT mice (Figure 4D–F), but smaller lipid droplets were observed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 4D).

Differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways (Figure 4J), which were identified as being mainly metabolism related. One of the enriched pathways is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, or NAFLD, in which most molecules appear less abundant in association with mannose receptor deficiency (Figure 4K), thus confirming the previous histological analysis. On the other hand, the gene ontology (GO) analysis identified the enrichment of the cellular response to the IL-4 pathway, where proteins are mainly upregulated (Figure 4L). This result suggests the presence of pro-resolutive immune activation, which aligns with an overall downregulation of proteins within the cellular response to the IFN-ƴ pathway and with the reduced infiltration observed by flow cytometry. Reduced steatosis and inflammation pair with improved glucose and insulin tolerance, as shown by more upregulated proteins in the GO cellular response to the insulin stimulus pathway (Figure 4L), as well as a better performance following the glucose tolerance test (GTT, Figure 4M) and an improved trend following insulin tolerance test (ITT, Figure 4N). However, no significant changes were observed in plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels (Supplementary Figure S6C,D).

In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory CCR2+ monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow phenotype switch in Mrc1-deficient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals fed with an HFD to induce obesity. We demonstrated an important downregulation of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production of inflammatory cells. As a confirmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte migration and the tissue infiltration pathways.

This finding seems unexpected given that the Mrc1 receptor is one of the key markers of pro-resolutive macrophages. However, previous studies have shown that the selective depletion of Mrc1+ macrophages improves the systemic insulin response and lipid handling in adipose tissue. These results suggest the presence of parallel mechanisms related to the presence of the mannose receptor that might be associated with the progression of metabolic disorders.",

Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells. These cells have been implicated in leucocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels. Therefore, future studies should investigate whether leucocyte trafficking could also play a role in the observed phenotype.",
