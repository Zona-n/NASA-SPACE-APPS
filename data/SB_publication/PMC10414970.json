Cell divisions in the meristem and rapid cell growth in the elongation zone propel the root tips through the soil. Actively elongating cells acidify their apoplast to enable cell wall extension by the activity of plasma membrane AHA H+-ATPases. The phytohormone auxin, central regulator of gravitropic response and root development, inhibits root cell growth, likely by rising the pH of the apoplast. However, the role of auxin in the regulation of the apoplastic pH gradient along the root tip is unclear. Here, we show, by using an improved method for visualization and quantification of root surface pH, that the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface pH shows distinct acidic and alkaline zones, which are not primarily determined by the activity of AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, the distinct domain of alkaline pH in the root transition zone is controlled by a rapid auxin response module, consisting of the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, the AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and the CNCG14 calcium channel. We demonstrate that the rapid auxin response pathway is required for an efficient navigation of the root tip.",

At the tip of the root, the root cap covers and protects the meristem, and is the center of gravity perception. In the meristem, stem cells produce transit-amplifying cells that populate the root tip. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the root cap reaches up to the transition zone, where cells stop dividing and prepare for elongation; the transition zone is characterized by a distinct physiology and shows a high responsiveness to external factors. Further in the shootward direction, cells rapidly elongate in the elongation zone, propelling the root tip through the soil. After reaching their final length, cells differentiate in the maturation zone, where the root hairs emerge presumably to increase the absorptive root surface.",

            "text": "To elongate, cells must expand their cell walls, increase turgor pressure or both. Proton extrusion into the apoplast by the plasma membrane (PM) H+ ATPases is crucial for both cell wall expansion and turgor maintenance. Acidic pH leads to activation of cell wall remodeling enzymes, and the H+ gradient at the PM drives the transport of most nutrients and ions, and as such is required for turgor pressure generation. It is therefore not surprising that root zones of numerous species show a distinct pattern of surface proton fluxes and cell wall pH. In general, the tip of the root and the late elongation and maturation zones show outward H+ fluxes, while the transition zone and early elongation zones show inward H+ fluxes. Several studies showed that this battery-like system, with positive charges flowing out of the maturation zone and entering at the transition zone, is mainly driven by H+ fluxes without completely excluding calcium and chloride ions. Similar pattern of H+ fluxes was determined in A. thaliana, where the fluxes also correlated with root surface pH: an alkaline domain was observed at the border between meristematic and transition zones. Other works have attempted to determine the pH of the epidermal cell walls, and show a general decrease of pH toward the maturation zone of the root. It is important to keep in mind that changes in proton fluxes and membrane potential are not always correlated with change in pH. For example, a simultaneous leak of protons and uptake through H+/K+ symporter in the cytoplasm can lead to apoplast acidification with a relatively stable membrane potential. In general, the relationship between H+ fluxes, cell wall pH, and the growth rate in the particular zones remains unclear: the highest pH is observed in the transition and early elongation zones, while the lowest pH and highest outward H+ fluxes are observed in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. In particular, the mechanism of the alkaline domain formation and its physiological significance remain unclear.",

Under conditions of light, the AHA2-mCitrine localizes to the membranes in the transition zone., presented a model where cytokinin signaling regulates root meristem size by controlling the expression of AHA1 and AHA2. Increased cytokinin signaling led to shortening of the meristem, similarly to an inducible relocalization of AHA2 fused to the glucocorticoid receptor. Finally,, quantified the AHA2-GFP signal and demonstrated an increasing AHA2-GFP membrane abundance toward the maturation zone of A. thaliana root, which correlated with increased acidification of the root surface.

            "text": "Roots use the gravity vector as the reference for the direction of their growth. A general pattern was shown in various plant species: during the gravitropic response, ion fluxes change rapidly, leading to increased proton secretion on the upper and decreased secretion on the lower side, where it correlates with growth inhibition, and results in bending of the root. In A. thaliana, the root surface and cell wall alkalinization of lower side upon gravistimulation has also been clearly demonstrated, and it was shown that this alkalinization requires functional auxin transport and the CNGC14 calcium channel acting downstream of auxin signaling. Alkalinization of the lower root side is thus triggered by the redirection of auxin flux toward the lateral root cap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the root. Analogously, apoplast alkalinization can be triggered by the application of auxin to the roots. The root surface pH increases almost immediately upon auxin application, and this process requires the activity of the CNGC14 calcium channel; in the mutant, surface alkalinization as well as the auxin-induced growth inhibition are delayed. The rapid root growth inhibition as well as the membrane depolarization and surface alkalinization triggered by auxin depend on the rapid branch of the TIR1/AFB signaling branch; auxin influx by AUX1 and the AFB1 auxin co-receptor paralogue play a prominent role in the rapid auxin response. The molecular mechanism of surface alkalinization is, however, not understood. It was proposed that auxin plays a dual role in regulation of root apoplastic pH: auxin alkalinizes the apoplast by the activity of an unknown ion channel downstream of the TIR1/AFB signaling, and, at the same time, auxin upregulates the activity of AHA H+ ATPases through TMK1 signaling. It is not clear how auxin activates the TMK kinases. On the other hand, the connection between TIR1/AFB auxin signaling and activity of AHAs has been clarified: the auxin-induced SAUR proteins inhibit the PP2C-D clade of protein phosphatases that act as negative regulators of AHAs, leading to the activation of proton secretion. This pathway was studied mainly in shoots, but seems also to operate in roots, as the Arabidopsis lines with manipulated SAUR or PP2C-D expression show root phenotypes that are consistent with the expected changes in AHA activities. In summary, the connection between auxin signaling, regulation of the activity of AHA H+ ATPases, and the longitudinal zonation of the root surface pH profile during normal growth and during gravitropic responses remains unclear.",

However, at the transition zone of the root, we could observe an alkaline domain on the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a). Further, we attempted to visualize root surface pH using Fluorescein Dextran and Oregon Green Dextran (Figure 1—figure supplement 1a) pH reporters, but the results were not satisfactory due to an artifact when roots were imaged on solid medium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1d).

The F488/405 excitation ratio of FS is insensitive to the redox state of the medium but influenced by cation concentration (Figure 1—figure supplement 1e). FS allows to visualize pH of the root surface and the surrounding rhizosphere, without penetrating the root tissues (Figure 1e). The pH imaging with FS highlighted the previously described relatively alkaline domain in the transition zone/early elongation zone of the root. In addition, we observed two relatively acidic pH domains, one located in the late elongation/root hair zone and the other in the proximity of the root tip (Figure 1e). To unbiasedly quantify the root surface pH, we developed a Python-based program to determine the F488/405 ratio of the root surface (Figure 1—figure supplement 1f). The quantification highlighted the presence of the observed relatively alkaline and acidic domains (Figure 1f). Throughout the text, we will refer to these domains as alkaline and acidic domains, by which we mean values relatively acidic or relatively alkaline in comparison with the pH of the medium. The surface pH profile of roots shown by FS is in agreement with the data obtained using numerous electrode and microscopy measurements in several species including A. thaliana. The FS pH detection range thus reveals both the alkaline and acidic domains of the root surface and allows direct and dynamic visualization of proton concentration on the root surface and its close surroundings.",

We therefore immunolocalized endogenous AHAs using the antibody which recognizes multiple AHA ATPases paralogs in multiple plant species (Agrisera AS07260). To test the specificity of the antibody in Arabidopsis roots, we imaged Col-0 roots, aha2-4 mutants lacking the dominant AHA2 paralogue, and lines inducibly expressing a dominant version of AHA2 (AHA2-d95-mScarlet). The antibody showed signal in the PM in Col-0 and aha2-4 roots (Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b). When we inducibly overexpressed the AHA2-d95-mScarlet, we detected colocalization of the mScarlet signal with the antibody signal (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c). These results indicate that the antibody recognized multiple plasma membrane localized AHAs in Arabidopsis roots. The immunolocalization of endogenous AHAs, however, didn’t reveal any obvious absence of AHAs in the transition zone (Figure 2a, Figure 2—figure supplement 1d) that would explain the presence of the alkaline domain. To overcome the hypothetical lack of AHA activation in the TZ, we treated seedlings with fusicoccin (FC), a fungal toxin that stimulates the AHA’s activity and thus increases proton efflux. FC lowered the surface pH of the root acidic domains but, surprisingly, did not affect the alkaline domain (Figure 2b and c). This partial acidification was correlated with the known FC-induced stimulation of root growth (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a).",

To investigate the effect of auxin application on surface pH profile and formation of the TZ alkaline domain, we analyzed surface pH in response to the native auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). With the increasing IAA concentration, the alkaline domain pH rose and the domain expanded toward the elongation zone of the root, which resulted in disappearance of the acidic domain (Figure 3a and b). The extent of the surface alkalinization correlated with IAA-induced root growth inhibition; the response was detectable at 1 nM IAA and was saturated between 100 and 1000 nM IAA (Figure 3c).

The alkalinization factors (a measure of IAA-induced alkalinization) were similar to Col-0 with the exception of the very root tip of pp2c-d triple which responded slightly less (Figure 2—figure supplement 2e and j). These results were correlated with control level IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b and g). On the other hand, knockout mutation of AHA2 led to reduced IAA-induced root surface alkalinization (Figure 2—figure supplement 2h, i and j), but strong enough to observe an auxin-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2g). The alkaline domain does not seem to be caused by the lack of proton efflux in the TZ, and the amplitude of the alkaline domain can be increased by auxin application. We therefore tested how auxin transport, perception, and response contribute to the spatial determination of root surface pH. First, we tested the mutant in the PIN2 auxin efflux carrier, in which the shootward auxin flux through the outer root tissues is perturbed. The pin2 mutant root showed a reduced alkaline domain that was shifted toward the root tip (Figure 3d and e). Upon application of 10 nM IAA to pin2 mutant, the alkaline domain position and amplitude were partially restored (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b), the pin2 roots also responded to auxin by growth inhibition (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c).

While the acidic zone in the elongation zone was comparable to control roots, aux1 mutants displayed a complete absence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 3d and e). Application of 10 nM IAA on aux1 mutants did not affect root elongation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1c) and did not trigger a root surface alkalinization in contrast to the control Col-0 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and b).

Interestingly, this treatment resulted in the establishment of a small alkaline domain also in the aux1 mutant (Figure 3—figure supplement 1f and h), likely caused by AHA-mediated acidification in the root tip and the distal elongation zone that did not affect the TZ surface pH. The partial acidification was again correlated with a significant root growth stimulation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1g). This experiment showed that AHAs are not fully activated in aux1 mutant and implies a specific surface pH response of the cells of the TZ. In summary, we have shown that the distinctive alkaline domain at the transition zone of the root depends on AUX1-mediated auxin influx.

First, we investigated the components of the canonical auxin signaling by using the tir1,afb2,3 (tir triple) mutant which lacks the expression of three of the six known auxin receptors. The tir triple mutant displayed a more acidic surface pH, particularly in the elongation and maturation zone (Figure 4a and b). However, it was still displaying an alkaline domain, albeit less pronounced than the control. In response to IAA, tir triple was critically impaired in whole root IAA-induced surface pH alkalinization (Figure 4—figure supplement 1b and c). As a result, tir triple was also impaired in the IAA-induced root growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). These results confirm that the canonical auxin signaling is involved in the auxin-induced apoplastic alkalinization and also partially in the longitudinal surface pH zonation. Next, to test the role of the TMK1-ABP1 apoplastic auxin perception pathway in the establishment of root surface pH profile, we analyzed the root surface pH profiles of tmk1, tmk4, and abp1 mutants. The surface pH profile of the mutants was, however, comparable to the Col-0 controls (Figure 4—figure supplement 1d, e and f).",

AFB1 is the paralogue of the TIR1 receptor; AFB1 has been shown to be crucial for the rapid growth inhibition upon auxin treatment, rapid auxin-induced membrane depolarization, and for the early response to gravistimulation. Similarly, the mutant in the calcium channel CNGC14 lacks the auxin-induced calcium transient, membrane depolarization, and shows a delay in the early gravitropic response. We analyzed the root surface pH of both mutants and found a more acidic root surface with a critically flat alkaline domain in the afb1 mutant (Figure 4c and d and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a) as well as in the cngc14 mutant (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b). We confirmed the similar result in additional alleles of afb1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2c) and cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2d). This shows that these proteins, apart from controlling the rapid auxin response, steer the pH profile of the root during normal steady-state growth by controlling the alkaline domain in the transition zone. The lack of the alkaline domain was not caused by mislocalization or absence of AUX1 protein in the afb1 or cngc14 mutants (Figure 4—figure supplement 2e). Similarly to the aux1 mutant, the localization of AHA H+ ATPases in both mutants was not obviously different from the Col-0 control (Figure 2—figure supplement 1d). We further tested how the afb1 and cngc14 mutants respond to IAA and found an overall alkalinization of the root surface with a partial rescue of the alkaline domain (Figure 4d and f) and partially impaired growth inhibition (Figure 4—figure supplement 2f–h).",

A plausible explanation is the localization of relevant molecular components in this region of the root. The auxin transporters AUX1 and PIN2 have been shown to localize to the lateral root cap and epidermis (, Figure 4g)., showed that AFB1 is expressed in the root tip and we could see an enrichment of the protein in the root epidermis (Figure 4g). To determine the localization of CNGC14, we expressed its fluorescently C-terminally tagged version under the control of its native promoter. The expression of CNGC14 fusion protein was rather weak, and localized to the PM of root epidermal cells, with an enrichment in the transition zone (Figure 4g and h). The expression of AFB1-mCitrine and CNGC14-GFP in the respective mutants recovered the presence of the TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4c, d, e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2a, b and d). Interestingly, the expression of CNGC14-GFP in cngc14 caused an exaggerated TZ alkaline domain (Figure 4e and f and Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and d), which underlines the importance of the CNGC14 calcium channel in the establishment of root surface pH profile.",

            "text": "It was shown that auxin induces alkalinization of the apoplastic pH and that this alkalinization correlates and is required for the inhibition of root growth. The same process occurs during the gravitropic response - the lower root side responds to the internal auxin by alkalinization, resulting in root bending. We reanalyzed the root surface pH using our pH imaging and quantifications, as it enables us to monitor alkalinization, as well as acidification of the root surface. Upon gravistimulation, the TZ alkaline domain on the lower side of the root increased rapidly, while on the upper side, the alkaline domain diminished and the root surface acidified (Figure 5a, Video 1). This led to a gradient of surface pH across the root that was established within 5 min of the gravistimulation which correlated with initiation of bending of the root (Figure 5a). The disappearance of the alkaline halo on the upper root surface indicates that the TZ domain might act as a zone of stalled growth which is rapidly activated upon gravistimulation. We further analyzed the gravitropic responses of the mutants with altered root surface pH zonation. As expected, the agravitropic aux1 mutant did not create a pH gradient across the root and did not bend (Figure 5b). Manipulation of the AHA activity by the application of FC or by genetic means did not prevent the formation of a gradient of surface pH and rapid bending of the root (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a and b). Finally, the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a slower gravitropic response, as reported before (; Figure 5c and d). As both mutants have a diminished alkaline domain in the TZ, upon gravistimulation, this zone could not rapidly react to change in auxin fluxes; instead, a shallow gradient of surface pH slowly develops in the mutants (Figure 5c and d).",

In the aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants, the alkaline domain was absent or less prominent during vertical growth (Video 3). This result and the fact that the components of the rapid auxin response pathway are involved in the formation of the alkaline domain indicates that, in this zone, the cells continuously rapidly respond to the internal auxin fluxes, and that this pathway is active not only upon gravistimulation. We hypothesized that the significance of this process is to constantly correct the growth rate fluctuations and to enable the root to quickly regulate the growth direction of the root tip. This would be particularly relevant in the soil environment, where the root tip penetrates the soil particles and constantly corrects growth direction using the gravity vector. To test this hypothesis, we tested the ability of WT and aux1, afb1, and cngc14 mutants to navigate through artificial obstacles, approximated by tilted agar plates covered with a rectangular nylon grid. We scored the efficiency of the roots in penetrating the grids with varying pore sizes (Figure 5f). WT plants penetrated the meshes more efficiently as the pore size increased, whereas the agravitropic aux1 mutant failed to penetrate in all conditions. Interestingly, both the afb1 and cngc14 mutants showed a significant decrease in penetration efficiency compared to the WT (Figure 5g).",

            "text": "In this work, we present a new method to determine the root surface pH of A. thaliana. Its advantage is the sensitivity of FS in lower pH range that enables a spectacular visualization of root surface pH, including the acidic domain surrounding the late elongation and maturation zones of roots, which was not detected with the previously published methods. FS is an inexpensive dye which can be excited by the common 405 and 488 nm laser lines. In this work, we avoided measuring absolute pH values; instead, we determined the relative pH compared to internal controls observed on the same medium. Absolute pH determination would be possible, if extensive pH calibration was performed during each imaging session. This approach would be very laborious, and, in addition, absolute fluorescence intensities might depend on the thickness of the layer of medium and many other parameters. Therefore, we recommend using FS to determine relative pH changes compared to internal controls, that is WT plants or mock controls imaged together with mutants or treated roots. We showed that apart from pH, FS can also react to other ions, however, given that the surface pH profile visualized by FS staining is in full accordance with the previously published works, we conclude that in the growth media, FS reflects primarily the root surface pH.",

We observed the lowest pH values in the very tip of the root and in the maturation zone where cells do not elongate. On the other hand, the alkaline domain partially covers the early elongation zone. The surface pH therefore does not fully correlate with the local growth rates. In addition, it remains to be resolved to what extent the surface pH correlates with the pH of the cell walls and the apoplastic space of the root epidermal cells, as previous work has reported a correlation between cell length and cell wall pH. It is possible that rather than driving cell elongation, the acidic domain in the maturation zone plays a role in nutrient acquisition and absorption by the root hairs. The cytokinin-mediated cell wall stiffening may become the dominant growth-regulating mechanism in this root zone, leading to growth cessation despite low extracellular pH.",

Inhibition of AHA activity led to slower growth, a tendency of slower gravitropic response, and the aha2-4 mutation caused a reduced auxin-induced surface alkalinization. In addition to controlling membrane potential and apoplastic pH, AHA activity influences auxin signaling by regulating auxin influx and diffusion into cells. These results might thus be caused by the reduced proton motive force that in turn might interfere with IAA uptake into the cells.",

It was shown that the auxin-induced apoplast and root surface alkalinization is accompanied by a decrease in cytosolic pH, indicating that the alkaline domain visualized by the FS is caused by a proton influx into cells. The phenotype of the aux1 mutant hints to the possibility that the AUX1-mediated auxin symport with protons might cause the observed root surface alkalinization. Also supporting this hypothesis, the transition zone of maize roots is the site of the highest auxin influx, as measured by an auxin-specific electrode. On the other hand, the aux1 mutant was capable of surface alkalinization when higher concentrations of IAA were added, demonstrating that the AUX1-mediated influx per se is not required for surface alkalinization. Further, the afb1 mutants show a defect in the alkaline domain formation, which favors the explanation that the auxin-induced alkalinization is triggered from the AFB1 receptor. Given that the mutant in CNGC14 is defective in establishing root surface pH profile, auxin-induced alkalinization and auxin-induced calcium influx, and calcium influx and pH changes are tightly coupled, we conclude that CNGC14 functions downstream of AFB1. Similarly,, suggested that auxin-induced alkalinization of the apoplast is mediated by a yet unknown mechanism. It is intriguing to speculate that the signaling pathway might operate via the adenylate cyclase activity of TIR1/AFB auxin receptors.",

The other TIR1/AFB receptors seem to be more important for the overall pH rise upon the application of IAA, in agreement with the results of. The localization of the alkaline zone seems to be determined by the intersection of the PIN2-mediated shootward auxin flux, localization of the AUX1-mediated auxin influx, and the enrichment of the AFB1 and CNGC14 proteins. We propose that the dynamic nature of the surface alkalinization observed by us and others results from the interaction of the intensity of the auxin flux and the constant rapid response that occurs in the alkaline domain of the root tip. In addition, the auxin-induced alkalinization is constantly being counterbalanced by the TMK-mediated AHA ATPase activation and apoplast acidification.",

The media was boiled until the agar was completely dissolved. Note: we always prepared a fresh solid medium for each experiment from a stock of liquid ½ MS, sucrose and agar, as re-boiling the medium might affect the results. The medium was cooled to a temperature of 45–50°C and FS was added to achieve 50 μM concentration. This pre-solution was then divided into two equal volumes to make control and treatment medium.",

In the robot, procedure started with 5×15 min washes with MTSB-T (MTSB+0.01% Triton X-100) then the cell wall was digested by 30 min treatment at 37°C with 0.05% Pectolyase Y-23 supplemented with 0.4 M mannitol in MTSB-T, followed by 2×30 min membrane permeation with 10% DMSO and 3% Igepal in MTSB-T. The samples were blocked 1 hr with BSA (blocking solution: 2% BSA in MTSB-T) and incubated 4 hr at 37°C with primary (antiAHA rabbit antibody, Agrisera AS07260, RRID:AB_1031584) and 3 hr at 37°C with secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat, anti-rabbit, Abcam ab150078, RRID:AB_2722519). The antibodies were diluted in 2% BSA in MTSB-T in concentration: 1:500 for primary and 1:1000 for secondary antibody. Between the all described steps the seedlings were washed 5×15 min with MTSB-T. For the final step, MTSB-T was exchanged by deionized water.

Zeiss confocal setups often have signal overload detector protection which does not allow to image the stained roots as such.

            "text": "When a suitable 458 or white light laser is absent, one could try to calibrate the HPTS detection only with the 405 lasers. The pH unit resolution is lower but it may be appropriate for the authors' needs. In addition, HPTS provides, upon staining and mounting, a very strong background signal. Zeiss confocal setups often have signal overload detector protection which does not allow to image the stained roots as such. Therewith, it helps to detect the root in the DIC channel and crop the ROI in a way that no background (free medium) signal is visible in the channel. Therewith, one can increase the gain without risking damaging the detectors.",

            "text": "We thank the reviewer for the suggestions regarding the other pH imaging tools. We have included the HPTS image into the supplementary Figure 1 – excited with 405 and 488 lasers. It is obvious that HPTS also demonstrates a similar pattern as FS: HPTS visualizes the strong alkaline domain around the transition zone (Figure S1a). However, the problem is that our vertical imaging system is a spinning disk microscope, and it is impossible to detect the cell wall signal due to the extremely strong HPTS signal around the root, which overshines the cell wall signal. Unlike the classical confocal, the spinning disk system illuminates the entire sample and regions of interest of illumination cannot be performed. We would therefore have to perform the imaging on a different vertical laser scanning confocal microscope that we do not have.",
