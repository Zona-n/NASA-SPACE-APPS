This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.",

As the predicted dose for ISS missions, in the absence of SPE irradiation events, is 0.10–0.52 mGy/day, astronauts in LEO could therefore be exposed up to a roughly estimated 0.1 Gy/year of irradiation. Moreover, during SPE events, astronauts could experience an extremely high dose of protons possibly up to 1 Gy or more, which would pose significant health risks.

Gamma irradiation was included to calculate the RBE of GCR sim and SPE sim. As charged particles generally have a higher RBE than photons (gamma irradiation) we used an elevated dose of 5 Gy. The results revealed significant difference in body weight across GCR and SPE irradiation combined with HU groups at 24 h post-irradiation exposures (i.e., day 14) (Figure 1B). Euthanasia was performed on day 14, and select immune organs were collected and weighed to determine if spaceflight exposures caused weight differences. Interestingly, all irradiation groups with HU had a significant decrease in spleen weight, compared to NL-Sham controls with intergroup comparisons between GCR and gamma (Figure 1C). For the thymus, SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups were significantly reduced in weight, along with both NL- and HU-gamma cohorts, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 1D). To address whether there are fewer white blood cells (WBCs) circulating within blood, which may result in weight disparities in the immune organs, common leukocyte antigen (CD45), which labels all leukocytes, was analyzed by flow cytometry within the total doublet discriminated (DD) events (Figures 1E–1G). The results showed reduced CD45+ circulating leukocyte populations within DD events following all exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 1F and 1G). Collectively, these results indicate that 24 h following combined exposures, there are immune system decrements, in both primary (thymus; SPE irradiation) and secondary (spleen; GCR and gamma irradiation) immune organs, which may be associated with reduced circulating leukocytes.",

Gating schemes within CD45+ events displayed neutrophils (Ly6ghighCD11b+), eosinophils (Ly6glowCD11b+), monocytes (Ly6g−CD11b+), B cells (CD20+NK1.1-/CD45+) (Figures 2A, 3A, and S1A–S1C), and NK/NKT cells (CD20−NK1.1+/CD45+) (Figures 3A, 3C and S1D). The results revealed elevated neutrophil populations in HU-Sham, - SPE, and gamma irradiation in combination with HU groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 2C). No significant differences were seen between monocytes (Figure 2B) or neutrophils (Figure 2C) with GCR or SPE irradiation alone compared with NL-Sham controls. There were no differences noted across all innate immune groups following GCR irradiation, singly or in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C). Interestingly, a significant elevation in eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT (Figure 3C) cells was observed in single SPE and gamma irradiation, that was suppressed in combination with HU, which indicates SPE and gamma irradiation selectively targets these cell types compared to NL-Sham controls. Moreover, these results also indicate suppressed inflammation in response to combination SPE and gamma irradiation with HU. Interestingly, gamma irradiation alone induced all innate immune profiles, compared with NL-Sham controls, which was reduced in combination with HU (Figures 2B–2D and 3C), indicating suppressed inflammation in gamma irradiation in combination with HU. Collectively, these trends suggest that higher doses of ionizing irradiation may be more toxic, causing heightened immunogenicity.",

To assess the effects of deep space-relevant exposures on lymphocyte profiles we first assessed B cell populations. The gating scheme for B cells is displayed in Figure 3A. Although no difference was revealed for GCR irradiation alone, compared with NL-Sham controls, all other irradiation groups, singly or in combination with HU resulted in significant reduction of B cells, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and S1E). These results suggest possible impairments in antibody-producing, plasma cell differentiation. To confirm impaired B cell differentiation median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of cell surface CD20 was assessed, as CD20 expression levels are reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells. There was no reduction in B cell surface expression of CD20 (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation processes are impaired with GCR and SPE irradiation, singly or in combination with HU, compared with NL-Sham controls. T cell lineages were also characterized by flow cytometry in blood following space-relevant conditions, including T helper (Th, CD8−CD4+/CD3+) and T cytotoxic (Tc, CD8+CD4-/CD3+) lymphocytes (Figure 4A). The results revealed GCR irradiation singly and in combination with HU significantly reduced circulating Th and Tc lymphocytes, compared to NL-Sham controls, whereas no significant effects in T cell populations were observed with gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E). In addition, SPE irradiation exposures (single and combination groups) also reduced Tc lymphocyte numbers (Figures 3C and 3E). Collectively, these results indicate impairment in B cell and effector/central memory T cell adaptive immune responses following deep space-relevant exposures, which can pose a major health risk limitation on future human exploration missions.",

Furthermore, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases. The results revealed cell surface IL-7R median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was elevated in HU-Sham, compared to NL-Sham controls, which suggests enhanced inflammation following HU for 14 days (Figure 5C). GCR and SPE irradiation, singly and in combination with HU, resulted in no significant differences in IL-7R expression, compared to NL-Sham alone, other than GCR irradiation with HU, suggesting GCR irradiation in combination with HU may have induced T cell activation (Figure 5C). Percentage (%) lymphocytes (SSC-A versus CD45+, plot example in Figure 1G) further supports the damaging effects of GCR and SPE irradiation on these population types (Figure 5D). Elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a clinical biomarker for inflammation, was elevated in HU-Sham controls, and in all irradiation-only groups, compared to NL-Sham controls, with partial reduction in combination with HU (Figure 5E).

The cytokine panel included Ifn-γ, Il-4, Il-1β, Tnf-ɑ, iNOS, Il-6, and Il-10, and showed that unique cytokine profiles are induced in each exposure group (Figure 6A). Il-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine and marker of the inflammasome complex, displayed elevated expression following SPE irradiation in the single exposure group, compared to NL-sham controls (Figure 6B). GCR irradiation displayed significant suppression of Il-1β in combination with HU, compared to GCR irradiation alone (Figure 6B). These results suggest combined simulated deep space exposures may have suppressed inflammation. Il-6, another pro-inflammatory cytokine well known for its involvement in the acute phase response, was induced in HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figure 6C), suggesting exposure to simulated microgravity may induce inflammation. Interestingly, GCR irradiation in combination with HU resulted in Il-6 suppression (Figure 6C), supporting suppression of inflammation in combined deep space conditions of GCR irradiation and HU. Ifn-ɣ, is a cytokine produced by Tc cells, Th1 cells, NK/NKT cells, and innate lymphoid cells-1 subtype-1 (ILC1). It has been associated with NK cell activity and improved macrophage antigen presentation. We found in comparison to NL-sham controls, Ifn-γ was significantly upregulated in both GCR irradiation exposure groups, singly or combined with HU (Figure 6D). Furthermore, gamma irradiation resulted in increased expression of Ifn-γ in combination with HU, compared with gamma irradiation alone (Figure 6D). IL-4 is typically produced by Th2 and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, and its primary role promotes cellular survival. We found significant fold elevation of Il-4 in all irradiation groups in combination with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls (Figure 6E), suggesting this cytokine may be critically involved in promoting cell survival in the remaining pool of cells following space-relevant exposures. Collectively, these results suggest unique cytokine signatures are produced following different simulated deep space exposures.",

We focused on miRNAs in plasma, as we have demonstrated that the immune system dysregulation is systemic and circulating. To determine the overall impact that miRNAs have on the immune system, we first predicted gene ontology (GO) terms with an false discovery rate < 0.05 from processed miRNA-sequenced plasma data for all conditions and filtered for specific immune GO terms (Figure 7). The GO immune terms were categorized by utilizing the GO Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) information for specific GO immune terms. An Upset plot (Figure S2) shows general up and down immune pathways in each listed condition and the overlapping pathways between conditions. Overall, majority of the immune pathways are downregulated. Pathways related to humoral immune responses were the exception and predicted to be upregulated due to miRNAs, as miRNAs in general can elevate humoral immunity. A more detailed analysis of the specific GO immune terms (Figure 7A) revealed specific pathways clustering together following specific irradiation exposures. We confirmed this pattern of immune dysregulation in deep space exposure groups in Hallmark pathways/gene sets regulated by miRNAs, which showed distinct patterns within each group (Figure 7B).

In addition, IL-1RA was also elevated in-flight, and returned to pre-flight baseline controls (L-45, Figure 8), indicating homeostatic inhibition of IL-1α and/or IL-1β may also be regulated in-flight. As both pro-inflammatory IL-1α and IL-1β levels are elevated in-flight, along with their inhibitor IL-1RA, it indicates that other factors involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression supersede IL-1RA inhibition.

Known effects of ionizing irradiation can cause immunogenic responses. Indeed, high-LET irradiation causes more damaging tracks and elevates apoptosis, compared to low-LET irradiation.

Whole body weights were significantly reduced in GCR and SPE irradiation groups in combination with HU (Figure 1B) along with reduced spleen weights in GCR and gamma irradiation (Figure 1C), which may be due to reduced circulating leukocytes (Figures 1F and 1G and S1). Furthermore, reduced thymus weights in HU combination groups with SPE irradiation (Figure 1D) implies reduced clonal diversity of lymphocytes during deep space exposures, which can affect adaptive immune responses against future challenges. In line with this, miRNA immune GO terms revealed reduced spleen and thymus development following all irradiation groups, further supporting that deep space exposures can impair immune organ development (Figure 7A). Thus, two possible outcomes are postulated: (1) delayed lymphocyte proliferation or (2) elevated apoptosis of both dividing and non-dividing cells. In addition, B cell differentiation and humoral immunity were also affected in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 3B and 3C) that may be partially dependent on cytokine signals (Figure 6) and Th cell populations (Figures 4B and 4D). Innate immune profiles were also differentially affected following distinct exposures, adding another layer of complexity to this model.

For instance, Wei et al. reported reduced thymic and spleen weights are due to lymphocyte apoptosis induced through elevated stress responses and corticosterone production on day 10 of HU exposure (25°–30° head-tilt angle). However, Ferreira et al. showed no difference in body or adrenal weights following 14 or 28 days (15° head-tilt angle) of HU. Furthermore, work by Tahimic et al. revealed spleen weights were reduced at 30 days (30° head-tilt angle) of HU, which may have partially depended on the number of circulating Th cell populations. In our study, reduced thymus, but not spleen, weights were noted in HU-Sham, compared with NL-Sham controls (30º head-tilt angle) (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between Tc or Th populations following 14 days of HU, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B–4E), but there were significant reductions in total leukocyte populations (Figures 1F and 1G) and B cells (Figure 3B). Therefore, reduced thymus weights in HU-Sham compared to NL-Sham controls may be due to overall reduced leukocyte populations. Inflammation following simulated microgravity has been recorded in multiple studies, with an associated mechanism of elevated neutrophil counts leading to uncontrolled musculoskeletal damage. In our study, there were elevated neutrophils (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), and Il-6 (Figure 6C) after 14 days of HU, suggesting neutrophil persistence, as IL-6 protects neutrophils from apoptosis. Certainly, inflammatory neutrophil persistence can be damaging if not adequately controlled. Therefore, these results indicate HU, dependent on cage conditions/designs, may promote inflammation.",

For one, SPE irradiation alone resulted in significant elevation of eosinophils (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell (Figure 3D) percentages, compared to NL-Sham controls. Interestingly, ionizing irradiation can cause cardiovascular complications, while elevated NK cells and eosinophils can contribute to these pathologies. Gamma irradiation alone resulted in a significant elevation in monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and NK/NKT cell percentages, compared with NL-Sham controls (Figures 2B–2D and Figure 3D), suggesting distinct immune profiles are generated between different ionizing irradiation types. Indeed, gamma irradiation had considerable effects on innate immune cell recruitment into blood circulation, compared with GCR and SPE irradiation, indicating different mechanisms of immunogenicity following irradiation damage, which may be a factor of the high dose of gamma irradiation. Indeed, overall cell numbers were reduced within all radiation exposures, compared to NL-Sham controls, indicating the damaging effects of ionizing irradiation on the immune system (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). However, for the purpose of establishing the RBE in this study, gamma was used at a higher dose to make comparisons between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photons (gamma). In addition, there are qualitative differences between the biological effects of each, such that gamma irradiation serves as a useful high-ionization control. Interestingly, all four innate populations studied are inflammation-producing cells upon activation and were suppressed when gamma irradiation was combined with HU, indicating the potential for inhibited inflammation. Similar impairment was observed in SPE irradiation in combination with HU groups in terms of reduced eosinophil (Figure 2D) and NK/NKT cell percentages (Figure 3D). As such, a reduced number of select innate immune cells 24 h following distinct irradiation treatments in combination with simulated microgravity, may be a result of impaired innate immune cell recruitment. In addition, miRNA immune GO term analyses indicated a general reduction in myeloid cell differentiation and FcR-mediated signaling in all exposure groups, suggesting distinct biological pathways involved in phagocytosis are suppressed during simulated deep space exposures (Figure 7A). Collectively, impairment in both leukocyte recruitment and phagocytic function can result in inefficient innate responses against challenges, i.e., microbial or viral. In line with this, astronauts on board the ISS experience immune dysregulation and heightened infections, which may be a result of poor immunogenic innate immune responses and recruitment.

These results suggest simulated microgravity suppressed inflammation in combination with GCR irradiation (Figures 6B and 6C). Indeed, this may partially explain reduced B cell percentage in GCR irradiation with simulated microgravity (Figure 3B), as IL-6 is a plasma cell differentiator that enhances humoral immunity. Furthermore, IL-6 differentiates naive T cells into T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which drives B cell maturation into plasma cells. IL-1β has also recently been characterized to play an important role in Tfh effector cell development as well. Therefore, reduced expression of both of these cytokines in combined GCR irradiation with HU may be indirectly linked to reduced B cell differentiation. In line with this, both GCR irradiation groups displayed a significant reduction in Th cells compared to NL-Sham controls (Figures 4B and 4D). Although distinct effector T cell profiles, including Tfh, were not thoroughly characterized, Tfh effector cell lineage would have been included in these overall Th cell populations. Additionally, CD20 surface molecule expression on B cells is reduced during B cell maturation into plasma cells. However, we did not see any difference in cell surface expression of CD20 MFI (Figure 3C), suggesting B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells may be impaired in GCR and SPE irradiation groups, compared to NL-Sham controls. As B cell numbers are reduced (with no difference in CD20 surface expression) within GCR and SPE in combination with HU groups, there is a lower pool of antibody-production vehicles essential for effective humoral immunity. miRNA GO immune terms displayed reduced B cell differentiation and homeostasis in SPE irradiation and gamma irradiation, compared with HU-Sham controls, but was no different with GCR irradiation groups (Figure 7A), further suggesting distinct immune-related pathways are regulated following deep space simulations. Of interest, robust gene expression of Il-4 (Figure 6E), which is produced by Th2 and Tfh cells, directly promotes B cell maturation to plasma cells and ultimately the release of antibodies. Therefore, although initial B cell populations are reduced, functional output may be compensated for via robust expression of Il-4. LEO spaceflight missions have described minimal differences in B cell numbers and antibody production of IgG or IgM; however, IgA levels in flight were significantly upregulated compared with ground controls. This effect may be explained by the general effects of circulating miRNAs, as humoral immunity is predicted to be elevated by miRNAs. In our study, general upregulation of humoral responses are shown, yet multiple miRNA GO terms revealed that the humoral immune responses mediated by circulating Igs and B cells were suppressed with GCR combined with HU, compared to HU-Sham controls, further supporting humoral immunity may be dysregulated following deep space simulations (Figure 7A). Future studies addressing the level of Ig antibodies, B cell/plasma cell distribution, and circulating miRNAs involved during deep space missions would provide further insight into mechanisms involved in humoral immunity.",

            "text": "A principal finding in our study was reduced expression of Th and Tc cells, compared to NL-Sham controls. As main components of the adaptive immune system, both Th and Tc cells provide the advantage of immunological memory and assist with humoral immunity, which are important to prevent recurrent infections and tumor development. This becomes particularly important during long-duration missions, where medial intervention is limited. Indeed, infectious agents such as herpes simplex virus reactivate during LEO spaceflight and are dependent on impaired cytotoxic T cells. Furthermore, previous reports have indicated ionizing irradiation activates T cells. However, the overall effect of ionizing irradiation on lymphocyte outcomes (i.e., activation or apoptosis) depends on multiple factors, most notably the dose and dose schedule. For instance, preconditioning mice, i.e., irradiation for graft transplantation, relies on lethal bone marrow irradiation doses and fractionations to reduce lymphocyte counts. In our study, GCR irradiation caused extensive reduction in both Th and Tc cells, compared with SPE or gamma irradiation (Figures 4B–4E), indicating GCR irradiation produced more damaging effects on these cell types. Inhomogeneous dose depth between charged particles (GCR, SPE) and photon (gamma) tracks may be involved in this effect, as gamma irradiation exposure groups did not significantly affect Th or Tc numbers, compared with SPE and GCR irradiation groups. Thus, GCR and SPE irradiation may target deeper immune tissues, such as lymph nodes, where the majority of T naive and circulating T effector cells reside when not trafficking in the bloodstream. The radiosensitivity of lymphocytes is dependent on the speed of DNA repair mechanisms relative to division, as non-proliferating cells are more radioresistant. Radioresistance is observed in non-dividing cells as these cells are in G0 stage, during which DNA is compact and stable, protein-protected heterochromatin. Proliferating lymphocytes, on the other hand, have exited the G0 stage and are in the DNA synthesis phase, which makes them more vulnerable to irradiation damage. Cellular division requires correct, undamaged DNA to be copied to their progeny, and if repair mechanisms are not fast enough, elevated apoptosis results. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms for DNA repair are upregulated, indicating after exposure to deep space simulations, circulating miRNAs are involved in DNA repair machinery, whereby DNA damage has occurred (Figure 7B). Although we did not measure apoptosis directly, miRNA Hallmark terms also identified select apoptosis pathways were engaged during GCR irradiation exposures, compared to HU-Sham controls (Figure 7B), suggesting elevated DNA damage may be beyond repair, leading to apoptosis, following GCR irradiation conditions.",

            "text": "We further assessed lymphocyte surface receptor expression of IL-7R. As described above, IL-7R is expressed on naive T cells, but not activated T cells, and then is re-expressed on memory T cells. Indeed, IL-7R MFI was reduced in GCR irradiation combined with HU, compared to NL-Sham controls, suggesting T cell activation (Figure 5C). In line with this, Il7R knockout mice have significantly reduced developmental T and B cells, and are similar phenotypically as SCID mice, which are immunocompromised. This may somewhat explain overall reduced lymphocyte populations following simulated spaceflight exposures, along with reduced thymic and splenic weights, as well. Interestingly, miR-199a and miR-142–3p target Il7R, reducing its expression levels; however, in our report, mechanisms of this requires further investigation. Conversely, elevated IL-7R has been linked to multiple inflammatory diseases. For example, blocking IL-7R inhibited JAK/STAT, ERK, and PI3K signaling of IFN-γ from memory cytotoxic T cells, limiting chronic inflammation. In line with this, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed general reduction of PI3K/AKT signaling and inflammatory response pathways across all simulated deep space exposures, indicating miRNA involvement in suppression of these pathways (Figure 7B). Alternatively, HU-Sham groups had elevated IL-7R MFI, which suggests elevated inflammation. Indeed, miRNA Hallmark terms displayed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) across all exposure groups, and HU-Sham controls displayed heightened ROS expression levels (Figure 7B). Heightened ROS can cause inflammation both in spaceflight and on Earth, which may be an associated mechanism involved during heightened inflammation in the HU-Sham groups. Therefore, IL-7R, along with neutrophil counts (Figure 2C), NLR (Figure 5E), Il-6 expression (Figure 6C), and ROS Hallmark terms regulated by miRNAs (Figure 7B) are all elevated in HU-Sham mice, further supporting inflammatory outcomes following prolonged microgravity. In line with this, ISS LEO crew member data displayed inflammation via elevated IL-1β and IL-1α compared with pre-flight controls (Figure 8, Table S1). Importantly, these molecules were induced early (day 15) during spaceflight, whereby the effects of ionizing irradiation exposures would have been minimal (Figure 8, Table S1), confirming inflammation is induced in LEO astronauts, similar to our ground HU model.",

Furthermore, lymphopenia recovery results in immune profiling changes that may be either detrimental or helpful to the host. In this report, compared to NL-Sham controls, robust induction of Il-4 following all ionizing irradiation groups combined with HU was noted. IL-4 is typically associated with Th2 effector cells, which are chiefly involved in allergic inflammation, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, and eosinophilic gastrointestinal inflammatory disease. Interestingly, during spaceflight astronauts experience elevated allergic-like symptoms including rashes and hypersensitivity episodes. Therefore, Th2 immunity may be the principal immune response generated during deep space exposures; however, further evaluation of the type of Th cell subtypes produced in response to simulated deep space exposures are necessary.",

Synergistic inflammatory or immunogenic responses were variable in some, but not all, measurements, and in some cases were non-productive. Furthermore, circulating miRNAs (cell-to-cell transfer via exosomes) contribute to unique immune profiles, therefore miRNAs may be important for immune-targeted therapies. Although not studied in this report, added complexities involving combined types of ionizing irradiation, as well as protracted versus acute irradiation exposures that would also be experienced during deep spaceflight, are necessary to consider in future studies. Furthermore, only a small snippet into the immune response was assessed in this study; therefore, longitudinal responses and functional consequences are also required in future studies. Nonetheless, we found distinct immune profiles and miRNA signatures are produced by each irradiation exposure group, singly or in combination with HU in mice. Therefore, selective countermeasures targeting distinct immune responses in crew members may be required during long-duration exploratory missions to the lunar surface and Mars.",
