Here, the impact of modeled microgravity on the shedding of Gram-negative lipopolysaccharides (LPS) by the symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri was examined using high-aspect ratio vessels. LPS from V. fischeri is known to induce developmental apoptosis within its symbiotic tissues, which is accelerated under modeled microgravity conditions. In this study, we provide evidence that exposure to modeled microgravity increases the amount of LPS released by the bacterial symbiont in vitro. The higher rates of shedding under modeled microgravity conditions are associated with increased production of outer-membrane vesicles (OMV), which has been previously correlated to flagellar motility. Mutants of V. fischeri defective in the production and rotation of their flagella show significant decreases in LPS shedding in all treatments, but levels of LPS are higher under modeled microgravity despite loss of motility. Modeled microgravity also appears to affect the outer-membrane integrity of V. fischeri, as cells incubated under modeled microgravity conditions are more susceptible to cell-membrane-disrupting agents. These results suggest that, like their animal hosts, the physiology of symbiotic microbes can be altered under microgravity-like conditions, which may have important implications for host health during spaceflight.",

These two MAMPs work synergistically to induce apoptosis and regression of the light organ’s ciliated epithelium during the onset of symbiosis. Early-stage apoptosis within the host tissues, however, is primarily attributed to LPS, and most of the LPS released by V. fischeri is embedded in outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) that are shed via rotation of the bacterium’s sheathed, polar, flagella (Fig. 1a–c).

Specifically, modeled microgravity accelerates both the onset and peak of apoptosis in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic, LPS-treated hatchlings. Given the role of LPS in the normal bacteria-induced development of E. scolopes, these findings raised the possibility that LSMMG may alter MAMP-mediated channels of host–microbe communication. MAMPs are a crucial component of both beneficial and pathogenic interactions; therefore, in this study, we examined the impact of LSMMG on the release of LPS and OMVs by V. fischeri, and assessed the overall physiology of the symbiont when cultivated under microgravity-like conditions. Examining the effects of modeled microgravity on beneficial microbes has the potential to both provide new insight on the underlying mechanisms of microgravity-induced dysbiosis and further our understanding of mutualistic host-microbe interactions during spaceflight.",

Under both conditions, OMV concentration was observed to increase over time, with both motB1 and flhA generating diminished vesicular yields relative to wild-type cells (Fig. 4a). In addition, by 14 h OMVs derived from LSMMG cultures were found to be significantly larger than gravity controls (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Dataset 1).

Similarly, in the motB1 and flhA motility mutants the means of OMVs from LSMMG-treated cultures were 45.35 ± 0.068 and 43.05 ± 0.065 nm, respectively, whereas the mean size of gravity-treated OMVs was 40.72 ± 0.052 (motB1) and 38.16 ± 0.056 nm (flhA). Differences were also observed in the abundance of certain sized particles. Gravity samples tended to contain a higher proportion of smaller OMVs (diameter < 40 nm), whereas those cultivated in LSMMG exhibited a more even distribution (Supplementary Fig. 3).

OMV-blebbing is modulated by both external envelope stress and structural deficiencies in the bacterial cell wall. Accordingly, the discovery that flagellar function does not, in fact, fully explain the model microgravity-associated differences observed in LPS-shedding or OMV release led us to hypothesize that LSMMG conditions may impact the integrity of the Gram-negative outer membrane. To investigate this, the susceptibility of V. fischeri toward a variety of cell membrane-affecting agents was compared in cells grown under LSMMG and gravity conditions, for the wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h. Three specific agents were used to disrupt different components of the Gram-negative cell envelope. First, the cationic antibiotic polymyxin B was used, which binds to Gram-negative LPS and weakens the packing of lipid A molecules in the outer membrane. Second, cells were exposed to the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts ionic interactions and causes bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis at high concentrations. Last, cells were also exposed to a dilute solution of Triton X-100 for 1 min, which is a non-ionic detergent that disrupts lipid–lipid interactions. After exposure, cell growth was assessed with optical density (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6) and plated to assess cell viability (Fig. 6).",

In previous studies, HARV-cultivated Salmonella exhibited significantly diminished levels of LPS O-antigen in LSMMG lysates, accompanied by a down-regulation of the rfbP, rfbM, and rfbI genes involved in O-antigen biosynthesis and ligation. However, V. fischeri lacks homologs to these O-antigen synthesis genes. In V. fischeri the O-antigen is comprised of a single pentasaccharide comprised of a two yersiniose, one 8-epi-legionaminic acid, and two n-acetyl-L-fucosamine residues. The two quantitative techniques used in this study, LAL and Purpald assays do not directly measure the O-antigen so the differences between the two studies could reflect the methods used to quantify the LPS molecule as well as the different architectures of the LPS molecules. Alternatively, the differences in LPS release between the taxa under LSMMG conditions may simply reflect the fact that Salmonella does not have sheathed flagella, whereas V. fischeri has a membranous sheath that requires more torque to rotate, thereby releasing more LPS.",

In many taxa, including V. fischeri, higher cell densities and growth rates are observed under modeled microgravity conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1a, e). It has been proposed that the quiescent environment of LSMMG and continuous reorientation of the cell are altering the extracellular mass transfer of nutrients and waste, thereby impacting the cell’s growth rate. Although V. fischeri is motile and there could be some mixing and disruption to the low-shear environment, V. fischeri may be accustomed to microgravity-like conditions as the symbionts regularly encounter low-shear environments when interfacing with the epithelial brush border of the host squid light organ tissues. Therefore, the observed increased growth rate may simply reflect the natural growth response for these symbiotic bacteria under low-shear stress environments.",

The release of OMVs is an important mechanism by which bacteria interact with their environment. OMVs derived from Gram-negative bacteria are produced in all stages of growth, and are frequently enriched with a range of bioreactive molecules, including LPS, outer-membrane proteins, and peptidoglycan-derivatives. These discrete, enclosed structures are known mediators of host–microbe communication in both pathogenic and mutualistic associations. In the squid-vibrio symbiosis, V. fischeri OMVs have previously been shown to induce hemocyte trafficking and apoptosis in the host symbiotic light organ, and are important mediators of bacteria-induced development in the host animal. Both exogenous LPS and symbiont-derived OMVs can induce significant apoptosis in the light organ of uncolonized, aposymbiotic hatchlings, even at low concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 4). Thus, even small fluctuations in the amount of OMVs released in LSMMG could feasibly shift the timeline of symbiotic development.",

Environmental stresses, such as temperature and osmotic stresses, can increase vesiculation in numerous Gram-negative bacteria. The hypervesiculation of OMVs has been shown to relieve the cell envelope from waste products and the build-up of damaged, or misfolded, proteins, which accumulate during stress and normal growth. Interestingly, the increased in OMV production under modeled microgravity conditions may also provide a possible mechanism for the increase resistance to environmental stresses and antibiotics observed in some microbes grown under both natural and microgravity conditions. The ability of OMVs to quickly remove toxic material as well as absorb and bind antimicrobial agents may also serve as an important survival mechanism for microbes under stressful conditions, such as spaceflight.",

            "text": "One of the major mechanisms by which V. fischeri releases the OMVs is through flagellar rotation. Certain members of the genus Vibrio, along with several other microbiome-associated taxa, such as Helicobacter, Brucella, and Campylobacter, produce flagella covered with a membrane-derived sheath. These sheathed flagella have long been postulated to be a mechanism of communication between microbes and host tissues. During rotation of the flagella, OMVs can then be released from both the tip and shaft of the flagella. Mutants defective in flagella production, or in the rotation of the flagella, shed significantly fewer OMVs in comparison to wild-type strains. This result is consistent with the V. fischeri strains grown in the HARV reactors, suggesting flagellar rotation is likely the primary, but not the only, mechanism by which OMVs are being released in both LSMMG and gravity conditions (Fig. 4). Interestingly, previous work found that flagella-driven increases in OMV release corresponded to smaller OMV size, whereas our results found that LSMMG-associated increases in OMV release corresponded with larger OMV sizes. This result suggests that LSMMG presents a novel stress that stimulates a unique nonmotility- associated mechanism for OMV production changes in V. fischeri. In this vein, LSMMG stimulates increased production of OMVs across a range of bacteria with distinct lifestyles. Hypervesiculation has been reported in gentamycin-challenged spaceflight cultures of E. coli, a bacterium with unsheathed flagella, which unlike sheathed flagella, do not mediate LPS release.",

Bacteria have previously been found to have altered cells membranes in both spaceflight and modeled microgravity conditions. For example, irregularities in cell volume, envelope integrity, and membrane polarization have been reported for E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus cultured in both natural and modeled microgravity conditions. The increased susceptibility of V. fischeri strains to membrane-disruption agents (Figs. 5–7; Supplementary Figs. 5–6) further support the hypothesis that the cell membrane of V. fischeri is weakened by exposure to modeled microgravity conditions. In addition, previous analysis of the transcriptome of V. fischeri cells showed no differential expression of genes associated with LPS production during either exponential or stationary phase when grown under LSMMG. Therefore, the results suggest that increases in the amount of LPS shed by V. fischeri occur primarily through mechanical means, and not through changes in LPS biosynthesis. Additional research is needed, however, to explore whether increased OMV shedding in LSMMG causes, or is caused by, LSMMG-related changes in cell membrane integrity.",

For example, in symbiotic bobtail squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions the onset and peak of V. fischeri-induced apoptosis of the light organ’s superficial epithelium occurs significantly earlier than under gravity controls, which could be explained by increased OMV shedding. Interestingly though, under LSMMG conditions there is also a delay in the trafficking of host immune cells within the superficial epithelium, which is also typically triggered by MAMPs and is dependent on the presence of the outer-membrane protein OmpU in the OMVs. This dissociated response in the host animal under LSMMG suggests microgravity may alter the content of the OMVs, or that the host may be responding differently to these bacterial-derived signals under microgravity, despite the lack of differences observed in the extent of LPS-induced cell death between LSMMG and gravity controls (Supplementary Fig. 4).",

The pellet was then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.20 M NaCl to yield a crude OMV extract. The OMVs in this extract were further separated from cellular debris by additional ultra-centrifugation at 90,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C through a discontinuous 25–55% w/v sucrose density gradient. After, the fraction upward of 45% was collected and washed twice with PBS by ultra-centrifugation at 173,000 × g for 4 h at 4 ˚C. The final OMV preparation was filter-sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter. OMV yield was measured by protein assay using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All final OMV preparations were stored at −80 °C until use.",

Cell-free filtrates from wild-type and motility mutants at 12, 14, and 16 h were diluted in PBS to achieve a threshold of 10–100 particles per frame. Prior to analysis, background values were subtracted from all measurements of concentration. All measurements were taken at ambient temperature (22–24 °C), with the settings for minimum expected particle size, shortest track length, and blur left at the factory default. For each sample, a minimum of 40-s capture videos was collected in triplicate, with the camera operating at the standard 30 frames-per-second. Between samples, the NS300 system was flushed thrice with PBS and once with deionized water. Further analyses to determine mean particle size, size distribution, and concentration were performed using the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis software suite (NTA; version 3.2, NanoSight, Ltd., Salisbury, UK). Background particle concentration was assessed by diluting and analyzing sterile SWT. A Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of the nanoparticle concentration data. The normality of the OMV size data—which contained over 10,000 measurements per condition—was determined with a Lillifors test. Significance was determined via non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test using a cut off of p < 0.05.",
