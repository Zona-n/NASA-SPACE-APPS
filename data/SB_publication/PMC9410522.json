High-throughput technologies for screening natural and engineered cell populations can reveal cellular heterogeneity and identify high-performance cells. Here, we present a method to desiccate and preserve microbes in nanoliter-scale compartments, termed PicoShells, which are microparticles with a hollow inner cavity. In PicoShells, single cells are confined in an inner aqueous core by a porous hydrogel shell, allowing the diffusion of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents for uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. Desiccated PicoShells offer analysis capabilities for single-cell derived colonies with a simple, low resource workflow, requiring only the addition of water to rehydrate hundreds of thousands of PicoShells and the single microbes encapsulated inside. Our desiccation method results in the recovery of desiccated microparticle morphology and porosity after a multi-week storage period and rehydration, with particle diameter and porosity metrics changing by less than 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to fresh microparticles. We also recorded the high viability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast desiccated and rehydrated inside PicoShells, with only a 14% decrease in viability compared to non-desiccated yeast over 8.5 weeks, although we observed an 85% decrease in initial growth potential over the same duration. We show a proof-of-concept for a growth rate-based analysis of single-cell derived colonies in rehydrated PicoShells, where we identified 11% of the population that grows at an accelerated rate. Desiccated PicoShells thus provide a robust method for cell preservation before and during launch, promising a simple single-cell analysis method for studying heterogeneity in microbial populations in space.",

As an example of biotechnology development, the BioNutrients missions on the International Space Station (ISS) aim to use engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other microbes for the on-demand production of nutrients to be consumed by astronauts on long, deep-space missions; the ISS BioRock experiment studied the ability of three microorganisms (Sphingomonas desiccabilis, Bacillus subtilis, and Cupriavidus metallidurans) to aid the biomining of vanadium for in situ resource utilization; on the Moonshot Artemis-1 payload, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii algae will be grown during transit around the Moon and screened for high producers of lipids and hydrogen. For model organism research, the BioSentinel Artemis-1 CubeSat will expose wild-type and mutant S. cerevisiae to galactic cosmic radiation and assays for metabolism and growth to better understand the biological response to deep-space radiation. For pathogenesis research, the EcAMSat CubeSat used a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli to evaluate whether microgravity affects antibiotic resistance in low Earth orbit. In each example, microorganisms are studied as a bulk population, with each sample made up of data obtained from thousands of cells concurrently. Thus, measurements represent the averaged behavior of all cells in a sample, which can mask diverse phenotypic properties of individual cells or subpopulations. Furthermore, each example relies on no more than 16 bulk samples per condition or timepoint. Single-cell analysis methods, in contrast, enable high-throughput characterizations of hundreds of thousands to millions of individual cells in the population, allowing the identification of subpopulations and rare individual cells.",

Two well-established single-cell tools are flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), which can characterize and sort single cells by cell size and/or presence of a fluorescent marker. However, these tools are unable to characterize time-dependent phenotypes such as growth rates of clonal colonies, the cell cycle, or pathogenesis. Additionally, the analysis of cell secretions with FACS is limited, requiring additional steps such as conjugating antibodies to the cell surface, where there can be cross talk between cells without additional precautionary steps.",

Standard high-throughput microwell plates have 96, 384 or even 1536 wells, but these ultimately have limited throughput when compared to high-throughput microfluidic technologies such as water-in-oil droplet emulsions, which can be used to characterize over 100,000 cells per screen. However, many applications using water-in-oil droplets require microfluidically co-encapsulating multiple reagents, such as hydrogel beads for barcoding or secretion binding, increasing the number of encapsulation steps and/or reducing the percentage of droplets containing all reagents. Additionally, the lack of continuous solution exchange in water-in-oil droplets limits the replenishment of nutrients and the elimination of cellular wastes, limiting the growth potential of encapsulated cells. A similar approach uses solid hydrogel microparticles (e.g., gel microdrops), but the polymer mesh can interfere with assays, especially those involving genomic DNA. In addition, gel microdrops can limit the growth of microbes in the microparticle and can be degraded prematurely by proteases and amylases released by the encapsulated microbes.",

The hydrogel provides a surface for binding and detecting secretions, similarly to a hydrogel bead in a droplet, while avoiding the co-encapsulation step required for beads. However, keeping bound cells from dislodging during long assay or growth protocols and changes in the droplet solution remains challenging. Furthermore, many microbial experiments in space, including BioNutrients, BioRock, and BioSentinel, desiccate their microorganisms prior to launch to increase long-term stabilities and to control microbe metabolic activation via rehydration. Encapsulating or loading rehydrated cells into water-in-oil droplets or nanovials in space would be an additional hurdle in translating these single-cell analyses to space biology research.",

            "text": "The alternative proposed here is fully closed hollow-shell hydrogel microparticles, or PicoShells, which can be desiccated with single microbes pre-encapsulated inside. PicoShells have a thin hydrogel shell around a hollow, aqueous core, where single cells can be encapsulated. The fully closed geometry traps the cell and its progeny inside the particle core, eliminating the need to emulsify in oil. Additionally, the hydrogel shell is porous, enabling a continuous exchange of nutrients, wastes, and assay reagents with the external environment without needing to destabilize the particle’s structure. The continuous replenishment of nutrients and the elimination of cellular wastes in the particle core allow uninhibited cell growth, more faithfully replicating suspension culture growth conditions and enabling the study of time-dependent phenotypes over days rather than only fast cellular responses. Meanwhile, the diffusion of assay reagents allows solution changes for multi-step assays (i.e., single-cell PCR or ELISA) or even multiple sequential assays on the same cells. The hydrogel shell also provides a surface to conjugate various desired functional groups such as capture antibodies. Finally, PicoShells are compatible with fluorescent-activated cell sorters (FACS) such that PicoShells containing single cells or colonies can be selected based on more complex phenotypes than non-encapsulated cells. Compatibility with liquid handling and flow sorting enables the automation of assay processes to reduce crew hands-on time or to enable use in uncrewed autonomous missions such as CubeSats.",

Our work builds on the foundation set by van Zee et al., 2022, which introduced the PicoShell technology. Our method renders hollow-shell microparticle single-cell analyses more feasible for future space biology missions that use desiccation-tolerant microbes. S. cerevisiae is an ideal proof-of-concept microbe as it is desiccation-tolerant, a model organism, and a useful species for biotechnology applications. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae has been used in prior spaceflight missions such as BioNutrients and BioSentinel. Meanwhile, solid hydrogel microparticles, without voids or encapsulated cells, have been desiccated and rehydrated in oil with surfactant while maintaining a morphology similar to that pre-desiccation. We apply this desiccation strategy to PicoShells with S. cerevisiae, desiccating particles in Novec oil with Pico-Surf surfactant under vacuum. We evaluate particle integrity via particle durability, morphology, and porosity of the hydrogel shell, and we evaluate yeast health via viability and growth potential. We further show a proof-of-concept growth-based single-cell assay on rehydrated particles.",

The post-rehydration viability for each yeast culture was calculated as the number of live cells divided by the total number of cells, normalized by the viability of the same culture pre-desiccation. For example, before desiccation, a sample of one of the non-encapsulated yeast colonies had 436 live cells out of 501 total cells (87.0% viability). After desiccation and 3.5 weeks of storage, a rehydrated sample from the same yeast culture had 188 live cells out of 413 total cells (45.5% viability).

Of all methods tested here, we found that the vacuum-based desiccation of PicoShells in Novec oil with Pico-Surf caused the least impact on particles and yeast compared to the fresh condition. In this process, particles are fabricated in Novec oil with Pico-Surf according to established protocols, with the addition of 10% trehalose in the dextran phase to aid yeast viability. Particles in Novec oil are strained through a 40 μm filter and washed with additional Novec oil, washing away non-encapsulated cells. Particles are recollected in fresh Novec oil, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube or well plate, and a small amount of fresh Novec oil and Pico-Surf is added on top of the particles. The desiccation process is completed by vacuum drying the particles with a compressor pump for 72 h with the tube caps open. To grow and study the yeast, dried particles are rehydrated with liquid YPD medium, which caused nearly instantaneously swelling in the dried hydrogel particles. The desiccation process is shown in Figure 1 and particle rehydration can be observed real time in Video S1. Rehydration also washes out the dextran and trehalose core of desiccated PicoShells, leaving rehydrated particles with a dextran-free aqueous core (Figure S1) and that are ready to be used for colony growth or other single-cell assays.",

After transferring PicoShells from oil to water, we tried three desiccation methods: vacuum, air, and freeze drying. All three methods yielded deformed, collapsed particles prone to aggregation (Figure S2), which limits the ability to handle or visualize cells or cell growth in individual PicoShells.

Diffusion across the shell is important for the exchange of nutrients and cellular wastes to support yeast growth and for assay reagents to reach the cells inside particles. These assay reagents could include small molecules, such as stains and drugs, or large molecules, such as enzymes and antibodies. We investigated the shell’s porosity by incubating particles in solutions of fluorescently labeled dextran (FITC-dextran) of varying molecular weights (20 kDa, 40 kDa, or 156 kDa). We measured fluorescence inside and just outside each particle, giving a relative fluorescence that represents diffusion into the particle (Figure S4). The porosity of +Trehalose particles rehydrated 3.5 weeks after desiccation is not significantly different from fresh aqueous particles after 20 min of incubation in 40 kDa and 156 kDa FITC-dextran solutions (p = 0.057 and p = 0.15, respectively), although the 20 kDa condition does show significant differences (Figure 3). Still, diffusion into rehydrated particles is more similar to diffusion into fresh particles within each size FITC-dextran than between sizes. Therefore, molecules of a given size can be expected to diffuse across the hydrogel shell similarly for rehydrated particles as fresh aqueous particles. In addition to measuring relative fluorescence after 20 min of incubation, we took measurements after 1 min, 1 h, and 24 h of incubation, which show that diffusion profiles over time are similar within each size FITC-dextran (Figure S5). Additionally, −Trehalose has similar diffusion profiles as +Trehalose (Figure S5), indicating that the presence of trehalose during desiccation has little effect on hydrogel shell porosity. In the few ripped particles we observed, an FITC-dextran solution of any size immediately fills the particle (Figure S4D). Ripped particles were rare and, thus, not of great concern.",

After 3.5 weeks, the clump of particles was large enough to block the orifice of the pipette tip, requiring vigorous pipetting to break up. After 8.5 weeks, the clump had to be sheared into smaller pieces to be pipetted, which was performed with the side of the pipette tip on the microcentrifuge tube wall.

We evaluated growth within hundreds of WT and rad51Δ particles after 16 h of incubation in YPD medium, demonstrating a simple method to observe the distribution in growth behaviors within a population. WT and rad51Δ populations were categorized into four growth-related subpopulations—“swollen” (yeast stretch particle), “grown” (yeast fill particle), “live” (yeast are alive, but not grown or swollen), and “dead”. Over half of the WT population grows to fill or stretch the particle (swollen or grown), around a quarter of the population is alive with little to no growth (live), and only 14% of the population is dead (Figure 5A). Comparing the WT and rad51Δ populations, the rad51Δ population has significantly fewer growing cells (swollen or grown; p < 0.05) and twice as many dead cells. With free yeast not encapsulated in PicoShells, individual colony growth cannot be quantified, and the swollen, grown, and live subpopulations identified here would be commingled and indistinguishable.

Other WT yeast within the population did not replicate more than a handful of times (fewer than 10 cells). In contrast, encapsulated rad51Δ yeast show larger variation in colony size over time, potentially indicating a spread in growth rate. Four rad51Δ clones grew to colonies between 100 and 1000 cells, although at a slower rate than WT yeast. One rad51Δ cell grew to a colony of over 7000 cells, equivalent to or larger than WT colonies, and a few other rad51Δ cells also grew to large colonies. These rare rad51Δ cells could be of interest for further study to understand why they grew so well compared to other rad51Δ cells. In a typical bulk population growth rate assay (i.e., optical density), the growth of all cells is effectively summed, so a researcher would assume that all rad51Δ cells grew equally mediocrely and would never know that most growth actually came from a few unusual cells.

Desiccating particles in oil before phase transfer to aqueous solution leaves the PicoShell core filled with dextran and trehalose, which are otherwise washed out in aqueous solutions. Desiccated PicoShells are composed of a desiccated yeast cell surrounded by a dry ball of dextran polymer and trehalose disaccharide, all surrounded by the particle’s dried hydrogel shell. During desiccation, the dextran core may provide scaffolding support to the hydrogel shell as water is removed, preventing the hydrogel shell from fully collapsing on itself. This may explain why PicoShells tend to deform more and irreversibly change morphology when desiccated in aqueous solution (Figure S2); the dextran is designed to diffuse out during phase transfer instead of being retained in the inner core similarly to when the PicoShells are never transferred out of oil. Upon rehydration, dextran immediately diffuses across the hydrogel shell into the rehydrating solution and may provide some outward force to help the hydrogel shell re-expand (Figure S1).",

Antibodies specific for the secreted proteins of interest can be conjugated to the particle’s hydrogel shell to bind the secretion and prevent diffusion out of the particle, and secretions can be tagged with fluorescent secondary antibodies. The same principle can be applied for other assays—any molecule that can be attached to a reactive thiol or maleimide group can easily be conjugated to the hydrogel shell during fabrication. This can be useful if a user wants to add motifs that capture genetic material or enable cell adherence to the interior of the outer shell. The functionality of conjugated molecules would need to be assessed after desiccation and rehydration, although similar work in which researchers freeze dried hydrogel particles in Novec oil with Pico-Surf showed that methacryloyl and vinylsulfone groups were still reactive after rehydration.",

            "text": "Specific cell subpopulations in PicoShells can be isolated using commercial flow sorters, with over 100,000 particles screened per sorting experiment. Flow sorting allows for the isolation of interesting subpopulations based on scattered light and fluorescent readouts. For example, in our clonal growth rate assay in Figure 5B, flow sorting could be used to isolate the fast-growing rad51Δ subpopulation from the slow-growing subpopulation, or a population could be sorted based on both growth and production of fluorescently labeled products. Isolated subpopulations remain alive and could be studied further or used as a parent strain for further engineering. Flow sorting could also be used before desiccation to enrich for particles containing a cell; few particles initially contain a cell due to Poisson loading at low loading fractions during particle fabrication. A low loading efficiency ensures that most PicoShells containing cells initially have single cells rather than doublets, triplets, etc. Empty PicoShells can be removed before desiccation via flow sorting, isolating PicoShells containing single cells. This is useful for researchers who want to increase colony sorting throughput post-assay and for flight missions where minimizing experiment mass is critical. In preliminary experiments, rehydrated PicoShells in water have been sorted on a flow sorter, but further experiments would be required to sort PicoShells in oil before desiccation. Flow sorting could be further optimized by using smaller PicoShells. In this study, we use PicoShells that are 70 µm in diameter. However, we can achieve PicoShell diameters between 30 and 50 µm to be more compatible with standard nozzle sizes used in flow sorters.",

Meanwhile, PicoShells fabricated from PEG-OPSS (ortho-pyridyldisulfide) and crosslinked with DTT can be degraded by reducing agents such as TCEP (tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) or DTT. While controlled degradation is a useful tool, undesired degradation should be mitigated. Other investigators have shown that fresh PicoShell-like particles made from 8 kDa 4-arm PEG-diacrylate are stable in nearly pure ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, and acetone and are stable through a standard 35-cycle PCR reaction with a maximum temperature of 98 °C during the denaturation step.

Screening hundreds of microwell plates per day is possible for companies with robust laboratory automation but still very labor and resource intensive. One 0.5 mL tube filled with PicoShells can more than replace hundreds of plates. Furthermore, cells in PicoShells could be cultured in a fermenter before high-throughput screening, more closely replicating the eventual production environment than microwell plates and potentially accelerating scale up. If PicoShells became an integral part of the strain engineering workflow, fermentation companies could bring the fabrication process in-house and forgo desiccation, but for academic labs or companies without microfluidics expertise, obtaining desiccated PicoShells from a microfluidics collaborator could be more immediately feasible.

Many microbes can survive at least a short period of desiccation, and some, such as S. cerevisiae, can survive for years in a desiccated state, but mammalian cells do not naturally survive desiccation. Ongoing efforts to desiccate mammalian cells via freeze drying are making progress, but in the meantime, nanovial microparticles could be more immediately feasible for single-cell mammalian research. Unlike desiccated PicoShells, nanovials do not offer cell preservation and have limited ability to study time-dependent phenotypes, but nanovials could still be useful to encapsulate and assay single hydrated mammalian cells in space without on-orbit particle fabrication. Finally, for applications not requiring desiccation, fresh PicoShells can be used for many cell types, including mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells.",

Clumps of PicoShells obscure most particles in the clump during imaging, may limit diffusion to yeast deep within the clump, prevent flow sorting of individual clones, and may contribute to reduced yeast viability and growth after rehydration. While the exact cause of the observed aggregation is unknown, one possibility is that particles contain unreacted maleimide and thiol groups from fabrication, which react to form bonds between particles. During desiccation, the Novec oil surrounding particles evaporates, and particles may come close enough for any unreacted molecules on their surfaces to react. This concept has been suggested before, and a possible solution is to block unreacted thiol groups, for example by incubating particles in a solution of N-Ethylmaleimide before desiccation. Particle aggregation may also be reduced by changing the oil type and surfactant concentration or by using alternative mixing methods during rehydration, such as sonication, although an ideal system would only need gentle mixing to rehydrate and de-aggregate the PicoShells.
