The International Space Station (ISS) is an isolated, closed human habitat that can be harnessed for cross-sectional and longitudinal functional microbiome studies. Using NASA-archived microbial isolates collected from the ISS potable water system over several years, we profiled five phenotypes: antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm structure/composition of individual or multispecies communities, which represent characteristics that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems. Data revealed a temporal dependence on interactive behaviors, suggesting possible microbial adaptation over time within the ecosystem. This study represents one of the most extensive phenotypic characterization of ISS potable water microbiota with implications for microbial risk assessments of water systems in built environments in space and on Earth.",

However, dynamic microbial interactions and phenotypes cannot be predicted based on sequencing information alone. Control of microbes in complex microbial ecosystems remains an important challenge, particularly with regard to the prevention and control of biofilms. Changes that occur to the microbial ecosystem and the water-system integrity or function can impact the balance and population dynamics of resident microbiota, resulting in the release of pathogens or toxic materials to users and the environment. In addition to the health risks associated with microbial contaminants and their by-products, biofouling can cause materials degradation and systems’ failure.",

The International Space Station (ISS) has been designated as a microbial observatory to enable research into microbial responses to the unique environment of spaceflight. The ISS is the largest human-engineered structure in space and has harbored over two hundred international crew members since 2000. The ISS serves as a valuable observatory to study microbial populations, especially since human and microbial influx is well-controlled and limited compared with most built environments. Sustainable life support is provided to the crew through regenerated air and water by the Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS). To ensure crew health and safety, NASA has diligently preserved ISS air, water, and surface microbial samples for years. An important part of ECLSS is the water-recovery system (WRS), which generates potable water from recycled urine, wastewater, and condensation using multiple mechanical and chemical purification processes. Even with these harsh treatments, including distillation, filtrations, catalytic oxidation, and iodine treatment, a variety of microbes are routinely isolated from ISS potable water, and previous in-flight water analyses indicated that bacterial concentrations have exceeded the current ISS specifications of 50 CFU/mL for all potable water samples. Sources of contamination are reported to be mostly derived from the environmental flora entrenched in the water system itself. Historical monitoring of the NASA ISS potable water system indicates a stable microbial population consisting of relatively few microbial species.",

For example, Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobiales recovered aboard the ISS are also commonly found in terrestrial potable or purified water systems. Although ISS water contains the same types of microbes found in purified or potable water systems on Earth, there are several causes for concern. First, microbial ecosystems aboard the ISS are consistently exposed to the chronic stress of the microgravity environment, which is known to cause unexpected microbial responses that can impact human health (including enhanced virulence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance). Microgravity may present a selective pressure that could shape the adaptation/evolution of microorganisms. Second, many ISS potable water isolates are known to be strong biofilm formers. This is of concern, as biofilms can be detrimental to the integrity and function of materials, inherently difficult to remove due to increased resistance to disinfectants and other antimicrobials, and present health risks to the crew. Moreover, biofilm formation has been observed to increase in some microorganisms during spaceflight. Finally, astronauts exhibit aspects of immune dysfunction during spaceflight and thus may be at increased risk for infection by both obligate and opportunistic pathogens.",

To better understand the factors involved in regulating how these ISS microbial populations can survive and maintain their ecosystem, it is important to augment these studies with functional phenotypic assessments of both individual and mixed cultures. As alterations in microbial characteristics can impact the integrity of onboard life-support systems and astronaut health, we determined whether ISS bacterial water isolates changed their interactions and community properties over time, which could potentially impact material integrity and infectious disease risks. In this study, we examined sixteen ISS potable water isolates collected over several years for a variety of phenotypes, including biofilm formation and susceptibility to various antimicrobials. Our results indicated that the microbes were resistant to multiple drugs, and combinations of antibiotics were necessary for complete elimination. When we investigated interactions between species, we found that interactive behaviors of some of the isolates appeared to depend on whether they were recovered during the same year or different years, suggesting that for these select organisms, a common history of coexistence may influence their interactions. In agreement with recent findings, we also observed Burkholderia species subpopulations that displayed hemolytic activity, which highlights a key phenotype that could adversely impact human health (particularly for individuals with blunted immune systems) and should thus be further explored for prevalence and associated risk in drinking water both aboard the ISS and in public water sources on Earth.",

Seventeen different microbial genera and five unidentified Gram-negative rods were represented from the list, which included a total of 117 potable water isolates. All microbial genera are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Our analysis showed Burkholderiales, which includes the genera Burkholderia (mostly Burkholderia cepacia complex, Bcc), Ralstonia, and Cupriavidus, to be the predominant order comprising 63.25% of the total ISS water isolates, and Ralstonia pickettii to be the major species of the order (Fig. 1a–b). We further calculated the microbial diversity for each year by dividing the number of different species isolated in a year by the total number of isolates recovered in the year (Supplementary Table 2). We found that changes in the microbial species diversity inversely correlated with both Burkholderia and Ralstonia spp. over time, with the relationship more strongly associated with the former than the latter (Fig. 1c). The composition of microbial species was similar as the same species were frequently isolated each year (Fig. 1b). To investigate how microbial communities in the ISS potable water system may have changed over time, we selected different species of ISS water microbiota isolated in early (2009), middle (2012), and late (2014) years for further phenotypic analysis, to better understand targeted population shifts that could negatively impact astronaut health and life-support systems (Table 1).",

Specifically, we found variation in the production of extracellular substances among select isolates of R. pickettii and S. sanguinis (Fig. 6a–b). Visual inspection of the 2014 R. pickettii isolates and the 2009 S. sanguinis isolates indicated that they may produce more EPS relative to the same species recovered in different years, suggesting intraspecies variation. In addition, we discovered hemolytic activity of select Burkholderia isolates. Specifically, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates displayed hemolytic activity, while the 2012 isolates did not (Fig. 6c). Surprisingly, our data revealed that the 2014 Burkholderia isolates exhibited unstable hemolytic phenotypes and variations in colony morphology (Fig. 6dright). Both hemolytic (α and β) and nonhemolytic (γ) colonies were simultaneously found on the same blood agar plate. In addition, both yellow and gray colonies simultaneously appeared on modified R2A (mR2A) agar and gray colonies were visibly more mucoid, suggesting varying mucus/pigment production among individual colonies (Fig. 6dleft). Moreover, the passaging of a single colony also produced colony variation, suggesting that this phenotype was not due to contamination but instead may result from an unstable phenotype. The different colony types shown in Fig. 6d were indistinguishable from each other based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (data provided by NASA), confirming that these morphologically distinct colonies were not contaminants. These differences in colony characteristics might be explained by recent sequencing data showing that the 2012 and 2014 Burkholderia ISS potable water isolates are different species. The intraspecies differences in 2014 Burkholderia colony morphology and pigment were not observed using commercially available R2A, TSA, or LB agar media. Surprisingly, the 2014 Burkholderia isolates that exhibited β-hemolysis also tested positive for beta-galactosidase, urease, and D-trehalose, which are uncommon for Bcc strains (Supplementary Table 3).",

Neutral relationships were defined when two strains did not show a visible sign of interaction.

Longer-term interactions may only become evident during repeated observations of the same environment. Microbial observatories have been established in a number of environments. These studies show how long-term changes may occur in a community due to alterations of environmental factors or the introduction of new species. In the current study, we used the ISS water-recovery system as a microbial observatory. Unique aspects of this environment include microgravity and the limited opportunities for the introduction of new microorganisms via crew exchanges and resupply missions. Frequent microbial sampling is performed to mitigate risks to crew health and system performance. While identification of isolates can provide useful information, phenotypic analysis enables an increased understanding of long-term effects of the spaceflight environment on microbial physiology and functional species’ interactions. In this study, we characterized antimicrobial susceptibility, single- and multispecies biofilm formation, EPS production, hemolytic subpopulations, preferred energy source, and multispecies interactions of sixteen ISS potable water isolates. Our analysis using archived ISS isolates showed that Ralstonia and Burkholderia, known biofilm formers, were the major bacterial genera between 2009 and 2016.",

Polymicrobial interactions between water isolates have been shown to affect biofilm functional characteristics, including drug resistance and morphology. However, none of these studies were longitudinal in nature. Of particular relevance to our study, Thompson et al. recently conducted elegant experiments using six ISS potable water microbial isolates (including some of the same species used in our study) and showed the contribution of individual community members to the robustness of polymicrobial biofilm formation. Interestingly, this work found that some bacterial community members were necessary for polymicrobial biofilm formation and that predation by phage or predatory bacteria did not selectively remove specific bacterial community members. While microbial interactions may appear to be stable in short-term studies, this may not be true for longer-duration interactions. Such microbial dynamics are critical to better understand the types of interactions and functional relationships that may occur in environments such as the ISS potable water microbial community over time. These studies highlight the importance of investigating the effects of long-term polymicrobial interactions in many different environments. Indeed, complex relationships between cohabiting species and a loss of antagonism over time have been frequently documented in longitudinal studies of pulmonary isolates from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. A recent longitudinal study using Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from CF patients suggested that the long-term development of metabolic divergence contributed to cooperative interspecies interactions that evolved over decades.",

As the section of the water system containing these isolates is downstream of a 0.2-micron water filter, introduction of outside contamination into the system would be highly unlikely. Thus, the isolates collected at any given sampling timepoint may reflect bacteria that have coexisted for extended time periods. As these bacterial communities will have changed over time, isolates collected during a given year (e.g., 2009) may interact differently with bacteria collected from other years (e.g., 2012, 2014). Our data corroborate this possibility. Based on our findings, we propose a hypothetical microbial coevolutionary model to explain the observed interspecies interactions that might have developed during spaceflight (Fig. 9). We recognize that our results may be explained by other possibilities, including (a) the limited number of strains tested in this study, (b) potential phenotypic changes that might result from culturing the isolates in our laboratory as opposed to microgravity conditions in spaceflight, (c) different nutrient availability between the ISS water system and conditions used in this study, (d) strains isolated in later years might have been introduced via contamination into the ISS water system, and (e) species compared over different time periods were represented by different strains. Regardless, data from this study provide a foundation from which to advance our understanding of multispecies microbial communities and their functional interactions in the ISS potable water system over time, which could impact crew health and system performance.",

            "text": "It is worth noting that studies have reported reduced immune function in astronauts during spaceflight, which when coupled with alterations in virulence, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance observed in some microorganisms during spaceflight, suggests an increased risk for infectious disease. Our observation of hemolytic Burkholderia subpopulations that were multidrug resistant in ISS potable water samples confirms previous work by O’Rourke et al. and suggests an additional risk for opportunistic infections. We expanded on these previous findings by profiling the type of hemolysis (α, β, γ) in the Burkholderia isolates and discovered unstable hemolytic phenotypes, as well as variations in colony morphology and pigmentation. Interestingly, there was no clear association between hemolysis, mucoidy, or colony pigmentation. These same three phenotypes were unstable during our testing and produced the observed unpredictable colony variations during repeated passage on agar plates. To our knowledge, this is the first report that ISS Bcc isolates exhibit unstable hemolysis, mucoidy, and pigmentation phenotypes. These unstable pathogenic characteristics also occur in several organisms on Earth. Notably, studies using microbial communities isolated from terrestrial water systems have shown increased resistance to antimicrobial agents and enhanced biofilm formation. In addition, studies using microbial communities isolated from spaceflight water systems have shown increased biofilm formation and bacterial predation in multispecies biofilms. Should the same phenotypic instability occur in spaceflight, it could present a challenge for detection and pose a risk for astronaut health. Further investigation is in progress to understand the role of microbial community interactions in antibiotic resistance, the virulence of select ISS potable water isolates, and potential underlying mechanisms.",
