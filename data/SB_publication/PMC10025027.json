            "text": "The significant horticultural crop, cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) is vulnerable to the excessive salt concentration in the soil, which contributes to its scaled-down growth and productivity, among other indices. The current study examines the efficacy of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming on the physio-biochemical attributes and tolerance to salinity (100 mM NaCl) in cauliflower under controlled conditions. The results showed that the salinity (100 mM NaCl) has significant deleterious impacts on cauliflower seed germination, seedling growth, and photosynthetic attributes, and provoked the production of reactive oxygen species. In contrast, different priming approaches proved beneficial in mitigating the negative effects of salinity and boosted the germination, vigor indices, seedling growth, and physio-biochemical attributes like photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content while suppressing oxidative damage and MDA content in cauliflower seedlings in treatment- and dose-dependent manner. PCA revealed 61% (PC1) and 15% (PC2) of the total variance with substantial positive relationships and high loading conditions on all germination attributes on PC1 with greater PC1 scores for PEG treatments showing the increased germination indices in PEG-treated seeds among all the priming treatments tested. All 13 distinct priming treatments tried clustered into three groups as per Ward's approach of systematic categorization, clustering the third group showing relatively poor germination performances. Most germination traits exhibited statistically significant associations at the p < 0.01 level. Overall, the results established the usefulness of the different priming approaches facilitating better germination, survival, and resistance against salinity in the cauliflower to be used further before sowing in the salt-affected agro-ecosystems.",

Simultaneously, the requirement to feed 9.3 billion people by 2050 is driving agricultural output into marginal regions, necessitating a significant advancement in the development of saline-tolerant crops. The most susceptible stages to salinity are seed germination and seed establishment. Salinity triggers adverse changes in biochemical, physiological, and metabolic processes in the growing seeds. Reduced water availability, ionic imbalance, the altered release of reserve nutrients, and changes in protein structural organization are some of the few consequences of salinity on seed germination. Besides, the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative damage to protein and lipids, DNA and RNA breakage, cell leakage, damage to cell membranes and organelles, loss of photosynthetic components, and cell death.",

            "text": "Brassica oleracea L. represents a popular cash crop and the second most economical cooked vegetable after potato of the family Brassicaceae. It is recognised as the chief nutrient-rich crop, including a broad variety of phytochemicals with health-promoting qualities such as antioxidants, polyphenols, flavonoids, vitamin C, carotenoids, and tocopherols and some clinically important sulfur containing metabolites, i.e. cynidine, glucosinolates, siringin, etc.. Therefore, ingestion of these cruciferous veggies has been linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular and neurological diseases, type 2 diabetes, and malignancies such as colorectal, prostate, breast, bladder, colon, and pancreatic cancers. As a result, Brassica oleracea L. crops, such as broccoli (var. italica), cabbage (var. capitata), cauliflower (var. botrytis), brussels sprouts (var. gemmifera) and kale (var. acephala) are classified as functional foods and considered as “Super Veggies”. On an annual basis, 20 metric tonnes of cauliflower and broccoli are grown on 1.6 thousand acres throughout the world. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) of the United Nations, China and India are the world's largest producers, generating 1.42 million ha area having the annual production of 26.90 million tonnes per year, accounting for 74% of global production (FAO, 2019). However, these varieties sternly challenged by saline circumstances lead to a reduction in crop growth. Among the B. oleracea varieties, Cauliflower (B. oleracea L. var. botrytis) is generally considered moderately salt tolerant. India produces around 13% of global vegetable output and ranks first in cauliflower, but as soil salinity rises, crop production and economic outputs may begin to fall. Many B. oleracea crops are now struggling with the effects of salt and other abiotic stressors as a result of intensive field usage of different fertilizers and the fast expansion of protected farming land. However, scar attempts have been made to combat and ameliorate the possible adverse salt stress influence in cauliflower. The present study was conducted to investigate the impact of different hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming agents on the seed germination indices, seedling performance, and physio-biochemical attributes of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) subjected to high salt stress by computing the correlation coefficient and principal components.",

Therefore, the main consequence of salt stress is a reduction in the cell division process, resulting in reduced development of the internodes, contributing to reduced growth and elongation of shoots, reduced leaf elongation, and rapid cell death. Increasing salt tolerance and using appropriate management techniques to counteract the negative effects of salinity on salt-sensitive species is one of the most important and difficult management tasks. Therefore, seed priming is the effective and ancient method to reduce the negative effects of various abiotic stresses. Various priming techniques have been applied to seeds of many crops to help them overcome growth barriers and establish themselves more successfully in harsh climatic conditions. Priming improves water uptake, causing the cell cycle in the G2 phase to proceed faster in pre-treated seeds than in non-pre-treated seeds, which can lead to cell synchronization, increased sugar content, organically producing compounds and modifying the Metabolic activities during seed germination and ultimately lead to uniform and better development of seedlings. So pre-treating seeds with chemical agents, which create a moderate stress-like signal, permits the establishment of a “priming memory,” that improves tolerance when the plant is subjected to various abiotic stress in the future.",

MDA level is a lipid peroxidation indicator that is more visible in salt sensitive plants compared to salt tolerant plants and can be used to determine the extent of oxidative damage, membrane rupture, DNA damage and cell death. In the present study, the results showed that MDA levels were increased over control in non-primed cauliflower seedlings (NPS) grown under salt stress (Fig. 6A). All tested priming treatments were found beneficial to counteract the salinity stress responses differentially with respect to MDA content (Fig. 6A). In cauliflower seedlings treated with halo-priming (NaCl-priming), MDA content increased steadily with increasing NaCl-priming concentrations (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in osmoprimed (PEG-primed) seedlings, MDA content was gradually reduced with an increase in PEG levels. Thiourea and proline priming reduced MDA content in a dose-specific manner and was effective over hydro-priming alone (Fig. 6A). Similar results have been observed in previous findings showing that MDA concentrations decrease in certain radish cultivars while increasing in others under saline conditions. However, in the control seedling, a lower level of MDA was observed with no primer and no salt stress (NPN) treatment. Thus, the present results showed that the MDA content of seedlings sprout from prepared seeds decreased significantly, indicating that these seedlings were better protected against salt stress.",

MDA formation in prepared seedlings is hampered by the activation of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms, as evidenced by maize research. The first organelle to be altered by salt stress is the cell membrane, since polyunsaturated fatty acids are one of the membrane lipid components most susceptible to peroxidation during times of stress. Increased membrane permeability causes lipid peroxidation, which compromises membrane integrity.",

The accumulation of proline in salt-stressed plants was therefore considered as a predictive factor for salt tolerance. In the current study, the proline content in the untreated salt stress (NPS) control is higher than in the no-prime and no-stress (NPN) treatment control, but significantly lower than in primed treatments (Fig. 6C). All priming treatments on cauliflower seeds significantly improved proline accumulation with increasing concentration of the respective priming agents in the cauliflower seedlings grown under the salt stress regime (Fig. 6C). However, halopriming (NaCl priming) and proline priming proved very beneficial in terms of proline accumulation among all attempted priming treatments. However, the lowest level of proline was found in the case of hydropriming alone, although it was much greater than the unprimed and unstressed (NPN) control and was considerably similar to seedlings primed with lower concentrations of PEG and TU (Fig. 6C).",

It has been suggested that proline amino acid aggregation occurs more frequently than other amino acids in stressful environments and may be a factor in osmotic management and regulation of plant enzyme activity. Accumulation of proline amino acids protects plant tissues from stress by acting as a fixative enzyme that reduces lipid peroxidation by improving membrane integrity and reducing cell membrane breakdown.",

When halo-primed (NaCl treatment), the protein content increased with increasing NaCl concentration from 25 mM NaCl to 50 mM NaCl and decreased when priming with 100 mM NaCl. When osmoprimed with proline and PEG, the protein content increased with increasing concentration of the priming agent. Higher concentrations of both priming agents, PEG and thiourea, showed the highest total soluble protein content in cauliflower seedlings grown under salt stress. However, water-primed seeds also slightly increased protein content, but the overall gain was much higher in the case of halo, TU, PEG, and proline priming (Fig. 6B). The growth of the free amino acid pool due to hydrolysis of protein during the osmotic adjustment process may account for the increase in total soluble protein under salt stress. Seed priming enhanced accumulation of all soluble proteins under a variety of abiotic stressors. Future research should address the mechanism by which seed preparation increases total protein content.",

Interestingly, all priming approaches mitigated the deleterious effects of salinity on chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, and significantly enhanced photosynthetic pigments (Fig. 7A–D). Proline priming proved to be much more beneficial for enhancing photosynthetic pigments than hydropriming alone. Halopriming was the least effective for pigment enhancement compared to other priming approaches in cauliflower. Salinity has a significant impact on all developmental traits. However, different treatments showed different responses to salinity sensitivity. Fig. 7 showed that the hydroprimed and NaCl pre-treated seedlings had no significant difference in Chl b but increased Chl a and total Chl in the NaCl pre-treated seedlings. The amount of photosynthetic pigments in plant leaves is affected by increased concentrations of Na+ and Cl−. However, it has been discovered that as salinity increases, chlorophyll levels decrease. Salinity stress causes a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, which could be due to its negative effects on membrane integrity, decreased biosynthesis, or rapid pigment degradation. It has also been observed that the long-term effects of salt cause the development of chlorophyll-protein-lipid complexes to be disrupted. In the present study, seed primed with Pro, PEG and TU significantly increased total chlorophyll compared to hydropriming in salt stress (Fig. 7C). In the current investigation, proline priming significantly increased chlorophyll content, and proline treatment was also reported to favourably affect Chl a and total chlorophyll content in salt-stressed S. bicolor.",

The results were essentially related to proline accumulation in prepared cauliflower seedlings, which lowered MDA levels and alleviated lipid peroxidation (membrane damage) with increased total soluble protein and photosynthetic pigments on seedlings treated with 100 mM NaCl. The present results imply that various priming agents such as water, NaCl, PEG, proline, and thiourea proved effective to accelerate the germination rate, synchronized growth, and metabolite activation under the high NaCl level. In summary, simple and affordable priming treatments such as hydro-, halo-, and osmo-priming can be used to improve the performance of cauliflower crops. However, additional research on the beneficial effect of priming approaches will support the scalability of sustainable production and increased crop outputs, boosted crop quality and quantity, establishment, and reduction of salt damage in order to meet food demand, particularly on agricultural land under a variety of favorable and stressful conditions, as this is a priority of modern agricultural research. The information gained would also support molecular breeding research to develop cauliflower varieties that are more resistant to salt stress. Understanding the processes that promote salt stress tolerance can aid in the development of strategies to achieve sustainable crop yields under these adverse conditions.",
