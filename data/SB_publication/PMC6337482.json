To explore possible mechanisms, the proteomic changes following spaceflight in mouse brain were characterized. Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on a 13-day mission. Within 3–5 h after landing, brain tissue was collected to evaluate protein expression profiles using quantitative proteomic analysis. Our results showed that there were 26 proteins that were significantly altered after spaceflight in the gray and/or white matter. While there was no overlap between the white and gray matter in terms of individual proteins, there was overlap in terms of function, synaptic plasticity, vesical activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism. Our data demonstrate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function. This might lead to a significant impact on brain structural and functional integrity that could affect the outcome of space missions.",

Gray matter is closely associated with the functional domains of performance, locomotion, learning, memory and coordination. On the other hand, white matter consists mostly of oligodendroglial cells, myelinated axons and capillaries. White matter allows communication to and from gray matter areas, and between gray matter and the other parts of the body. It functions by transmitting the information from the different parts of the body towards the cerebral cortex. It modulates the distribution of action potentials, acting as a relay and coordinating communication between different brain regions. Changes in gray matter are known to be primarily associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, with secondary effects on the white matter. The deficits range from language ability to delayed memory and visuospatial construction. Disrupted white matter organization has been linked to poorer motor performance. Studies have shown altered expressions of a number of genes and proteins involving a wide spectrum of biological functions following exposure to space environments. These alterations induced distinct changes specific to the regions of the brain. Regional difference in stress response was also documented following simulated microgravity in human brain gray matter and white matter.",

It is thought to be involved in presynaptic plasticity and synaptic vesicle release, particularly in excitatory synapses. Myosin VA (MYO5A) is an F-actin-based motor protein that is also important in the generation and movement of synaptic vesicles. It has been found in dendritic spines and synaptic vesicles and appears to be critical for synaptic plasticity and organelle transport (reviewed in Reference).",

DNAJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5) is a pre-synaptic DNAJ C-class Hsp40 co-chaperone that is primarily expressed in the brain and retina (reviewed in). It is part of a complex of proteins that resides on synaptic vesicles and chaperones pre-synaptic SNARE proteins, making it critical during repeated synaptic vesicle cycles.

Interestingly, an increase in oxidative stress has been shown to cause a decrease in this protein, particularly in the brains of aged or Parkinson’s disease models. This lack has been associated with neurodegenerative disease, which has been linked to changes in glucose homeostasis. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is an abundant enzyme in brain tissue that is critical to energy metabolism and glycolysis. In conditions of oxidative stress, GAPDH activity is impaired, leading to cellular aging and apoptosis.

After mounting and de-paraffinizing, six 3 mm diameter circular punches of tissue were obtained to provide three replicate samples each of white matter of the corpus callosum and gray matter of the cerebral cortex. Each tissue punch (disk) was transferred to a vial for individual processing (work up) by a modification of the methodology of Craven et al.. When tissues are processed by the Craven method, formalin fixed tissues still yield 80% or more of the available proteins for proteomic analyses. The preparation of the tissue samples for proteomic mass spectrometry (MS) analysis in this paper is described by the steps below.",

A urea-ammonium bicarbonate buffer (UA) that is 50 mM with respect to ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and 8 M with respect to ultrapure urea () was prepared fresh on the day of use. The use of the Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device has been outlined next. (a) To each vial after protein extraction (see above) 300 μL of UA were added and vortexed. The sample components were transferred to an Amicon Ultra, centrifuged at 10,000× g for 10 min, and the filtrate was discarded. (b) To complete the transfer initiated above and to continue the replacement of reagents from the protein extraction procedure described in 2.4 above with UA constituents, the above process was repeated twice using 400 μL UA each time, and both filtrates were discarded. (c) Next, 5 μL each of 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) and 10 mM acrylamide and 200 μL UA were combined. The entire volume was then transferred to the Amicon Ultra, incubated for 30 min at ambient temperatures, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (d) The reagents were washed by the addition of 400 μL UA, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. (e) The urea was washed out by the addition of 400 μL of 50 mM ABC, centrifuged, and the filtrate was discarded. This process was repeated twice more. (f) Next, 200 μL of 50 mM ABC were added and a protein assay (Nanodrop, , or Micro BCA, ) was performed on an aliquot. (g) A prepared trypsin digestion solution was added to the remaining protein in the Amicon Ultra. The 100 μL of 250 mM ABC were combined with 2.5 μL of 1% Promega PMax () to give a 0.025% working solution plus sufficient sequencer-grade trypsin to result in an enzyme to protein ratio in the range of 1:25–50. (h) The solution was incubated overnight at 37 °C to convert the proteins to peptides. (i) The next morning, 150 μL of water was added, centrifuged, and the filtrate containing the peptides was collected. These steps were repeated using another 150 μL water and the filtrates were combined. (j) Next, 20 µL of 10% TFA were added to the combined filtrates to destroy the PMax. (k) The filtrate was concentrated in a vacuum centrifuge to a volume of 100 μL and stored at −80 °C. (l) Just prior to MS analysis, a 2–5 μg portion of each protein/peptide sample was purified with a Zip-tip C18 P10 (). The sample preparations from each set of the three replicate “punches” were pooled, resulting in a total of 20 samples for MS analysis.",

In parallel, the data processing was performed using our DeMix Q algorithm. Briefly, DeMix “unmixes” the MS/MS events that become frequently but accidentally multiplexed because more than one (up to four) precursor ions are selected for fragmentation within the same m/z window simultaneously. DeMix allows one to identify more peptides on average than there were precursors selected for MS/MS. For extension of the peptide identity “between the runs” and thus additionally increase the number of identified peptides while simultaneously improving quantification accuracy, we used DeMix Q, an extension of the DeMix algorithm that employs the scoring of identity transfer. Further improvement in quantification accuracy can be achieved with the help of our Diffacto algorithm that selects for protein quantification of only “well-behaved” peptides.",

These unique “proteomic signatures” of brain tissue may provide new mechanistic insight into the complex biological response to space environment. We propose that spaceflight conditions induce changes in neuronal structure, cellular function, oxidative response, mitochondrial function and metabolism, which, in turn, might lead to tissue injury and late neurodegeneration. The diverse changes in protein expression profiles in white and gray matter in response to spaceflight conditions warrants further investigation. Further studies are also necessary to elucidate the possible tissue and functional impact responsible for our findings and to identify effective countermeasures.",
