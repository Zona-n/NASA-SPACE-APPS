            "text": "In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5-dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.",

Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production by P. aeruginosa is a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection. Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations in mucA results in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection. Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics.",

Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage.

CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of the chaperone/usher pathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation. These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria, contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa and provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling.",

We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end of cupB4 (Fig. 1A) and introduced a σ70-dependent PGm promoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes. Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD600) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD600) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression of cupB4, cupB5, or cupB6 was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an N-terminal HA epitope and C-terminal H6 tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. 1B). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. 1C). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22.",

In-frame deletion of algW in PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. 2B). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused to lacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE, β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. S1).

However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H6 tag or containing a deletion of the Asn1016-Ile1017-Trp1018 sequence and a C-terminal H6 tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table S1).

We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in vitro by the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. 4A & 4B).

Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. 4C). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of 35S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. 4D). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. 4D), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 4D). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucB in vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compare Figs. 4B and 4D).

Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute 35S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. 5A). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of 35S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more 35S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. 5A). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers. By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. S2).",

This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of 35S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. 5B). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. 5C). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold.

The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual.

Notably, alginate levels in this strain were higher than in the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), suggesting that activation of AlgW through MucE and through CupB5 occur synergistically. Our biochemical results predict that MucB should not be genetically required for CupB5-mediated pathway activation. To test this prediction, we used a transposon-insertion strain, PAO1-mucB::tetR, which displayed an elevated level of basal alginate production and mucoid phenotype (Fig. 6B). When we transformed PAO1-mucB::tetR with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H6, alginate production increased compared to the empty-vector control (Fig. 6B), indicating that CupB5 overexpression induces pathway activation by a MucB-independent mechanism. Finally, we tested if expression of the CupB4 chaperone, which should facilitate export of CupB5 rather than its periplasmic accumulation, would decrease alginate production. Indeed, when we transformed PAO1-VE22 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB4-H6, alginate production was suppressed and the mucoid phenotype of the parent strain was reversed (Fig. 6B). This result supports a model in which interactions between accumulated periplasmic CupB5 and periplasmic AlgW leads to induction of alginate production and mucoidy.",

This discrepancy between results in vivo and in vitro could arise because the GYYYT peptide in HA-CupB51–489-H6 is altered by proteolysis or is masked by tertiary structure, aggregation, or binding to another cellular component. We also note that expression of full-length HA-CupB5-H6 and truncated HA-CupB51–585-H6 resulted in somewhat higher alginate levels than expression of HA-CupB51–491-H6.

Overproduction of CupB5 can partially bypass this second requirement by helping OMP-bound AlgW compete with MucB for MucA binding and proteolysis. Expression of CupB5 under non-stress conditions increases alginate production similarly to non-stress expression of MucE. In these experiments, a signal that directly antagonizes MucB inhibition could arise indirectly as a consequence of other molecules whose concentrations increase as a consequence of CupB5 or MucE expression or might always be present at some level in the periplasm. For example, some level of unassembled OMPs and LPS is probably always present in the periplasm.

Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion.

Cells overexpressing MucB, AlgW, RseB or DegS were resuspended in native lysis buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 20 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole] and lysed by sonication. Cells overexpressing MucA or RseA were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 8 M guanidine hydrochloride (pH 8)] and allowed to lyse at room temperature for 30 min. For all preparations, lysates were cleared by centrifugation and applied to Ni-NTA columns pre-equilibrated in native lysis buffer or denaturing lysis buffer. Columns were washed with lysis buffer and proteins eluted with elution buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 500 mM KCl, 500 mM imidazole; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole]. Proteins were then dialyzed overnight against storage buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA] and then again against fresh buffer before being stored frozen at −80°C. Prior to dialysis and storage, MucB and RseB were chromatographed on a size-exclusion column and only fractions corresponding to the dimer were collected. To obtain radiolabeled 35S-MucA,35S-RseA, or 35S-MucB, cells were grown in a defined rich medium (TekNova) lacking methionine and 35S-methionine was added upon induction. Purification of 35S-MucA and 35S-RseA then proceeded as described above for unlabeled MucA and RseA. Cells expressing 35S-MucB were lysed by the addition of lysozyme and three freeze-thaw cycles, and purification then proceeded as described above. All peptides were synthesized by GenScript and purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a C18 column. Purified products were lyophilized, stored at −20°C, then resuspended in storage buffer and used immediately. The L-IIA LPS fragment was a gift from Santiago Lima (MIT).",

Briefly, cleavage reactions were performed at 25°C in reaction buffer [P. aeruginosa proteins: 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 200 mM KCl, 10% glycerol; E. coli proteins: 150 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.3), 380 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 4 mM EDTA]. Reactions were initiated by the addition of protease and quenched after different times by addition of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Following centrifugation, acid-soluble reaction products were quantified by scintillation counting and compared to total radioactivity from control samples. Cleavage activity for peptide-activation assays and experiments involving MucB are reported as a second-order rate constant calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the substrate and enzyme concentrations. Activity at different substrate concentrations for the Michaelis-Menten curve was calculated by dividing the rate of substrate cleavage by the enzyme concentration.",

(B) Second-order rate constants for MucA cleavage were determined by incubating 35S-labelled MucA (20 μM) and AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) with different concentrations of WVF or CupB5 peptides and measuring the time-dependent increase in acid-soluble products. Rates were divided by the MucA and AlgW concentrations to determine activity. Lines are fits to the equation activity = basal + stimulated/(1+(Kact/[peptide])h). Values are averages ± SEM (n=2). (C) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) were determined as described in panel B in the presence of different combinations of WVF peptide (110 μM), MucB (25 μM dimer), and wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides (405 μM). Values are averages of two or more independent trials ± SEM. (D) Second-order rate constants for cleavage of 35S-MucA (20 μM) by AlgW (0.5 μM trimer) and WVF peptide (150 μM) were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of the GYYYT, GYYYTVV, or sequence-scrambled YVGYVTY peptides. Lines are fits to the Hill equation: rate = basal + Vmax/(1 + (Ks/[peptide])h). For GYYYT, Ks was 55 ± 13 μM and h was 2.1 ± 0.9. For GYYYTVV, Ks was 143 ± 31 μM and h was 3.5 ± 2.2.",
