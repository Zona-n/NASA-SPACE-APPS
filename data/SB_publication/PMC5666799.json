            "text": "Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs γ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",

Weightlessness-induced musculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut health. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern because of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions, which can induce oxidative stress in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and GCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and γ rays), high linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized 56Fe- and 12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents, such as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons. Estimates of the total absorbed dose during a Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28–47 cGy, with GCR contributing 27 cGy. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from a fatal cancer drives the NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit, though NASA is investigating additional risks associated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure.",

            "text": "Irradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in a complex and transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species formation in the marrow and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2). Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors as well as contribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts. High-LET 56Fe (≥200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation during osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in a dose-dependent manner. Further, irradiation in vitro with 56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells. At higher doses (400–800 cGy), irradiation with X-rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells. However, the role of oxidative stress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term, in particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized.",

First, are the severity of acute bone loss and impairment of osteoblastogenesis following TBI dependent on radiation type (LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults to skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that: (1) irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure, and leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; (2) TBI induces both persistent changes in redox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, (3) addition of an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced damage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress dependent mechanism.",

For in vitro work, we selected 137Cs γ rays as a low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure testing. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI (at 200 cGy) with 56Fe, while protons had a milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes were observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase (at 200 cGy 56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an antioxidant (i.e., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with γ rays, but failed to protect fully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions.",

In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of radiation type and changes in the oxidative milieu of bone marrow related to marrow-derived osteoprogenitor differentiation. We found that low doses (below 50 cGy) of either low-LET protons or high-LET 56Fe did not cause observable adverse effects on structure and osteoblastogenesis at any endpoint, and, further, did not strongly perturb antioxidant capacity at seven days of exposure (Figure 6) nor expression levels of redox-related genes (Figure 4, Table 2) at 35 days of exposure. In contrast, only a high dose of 56Fe radiation (200 cGy) was sufficient to induce detrimental effects on total antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations of the marrow (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). These changes were associated with transient elevations in mRNA levels (Figure 4C,D) of an antioxidant gene (Catalase) and a DNA-damage/cell cycle arrest marker (Gadd45) during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis, which we speculate indicates persistent oxidative stress or enhanced antioxidant defenses during the proliferative phase. Interestingly, cultures showed a trend towards elevation of osteocalcin (Bglap, Figure 4D), a late marker of differentiation, during the proliferative phase, which may indicate that 56Fe exposure accelerated differentiation.",

These findings are consistent with our data showing the marrow cell response to increase mRNA expression levels of the master antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, shown previously, and with effects also evident in a cell line at even higher doses. Our group showed that a dietary supplement rich in antioxidants and polyphenols (dried plum) prevents bone loss and Nrf2 induction from γ irradiation in mice, supportive of the role of oxidative stress in driving acute bone loss.

Interestingly, these two genes are targets of Foxo transcription factors. Nrf2, Foxos, and p21 are critical to the antioxidant response element.

Taken together with gene expression data, these findings suggest that irradiation induced persistent oxidative stress that impaired colony formation via reduced proliferation (e.g., delayed or halted cell division) leading to lower extent of mineralization. Higher doses of γ irradiation (>500 cGy) are required to recapitulate the impairment of osteoblastogenesis, where changes are also associated with oxidative damage.

At 5-weeks after irradiation, exposure to high-LET 56Fe irradiation at or above 50 cGy caused decrements in fractional bone volume and trabecular number, and increases in trabecular spacing (Figure 3), indicating a significant deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture, consistent with previous findings. The magnitude of the changes caused by protons or 56Fe were similar, although the effect of protons at 50 cGy on BV/TV was not statistically significant (p = 0.12). Thus, these findings indicate that the threshold for a persistent, 56Fe radiation-induced response lies between 10 and 50 cGy—doses relevant to exploration missions. Overall, we show that a high dose of radiation was able to induce persistent decrements in cancellous bone, regardless of radiation type (Figure 3). Others have shown that these changes persist to four months post-exposure. In this study, the structural decrement affected by 56Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure due to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time (Table 1), likely the product of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts. These data are consistent with our previous findings from growing female mice after exposure to low-LET γ radiation. Although others have shown cortical changes following irradiation with either low-LET γ at high doses (500 cGy) or high-LET 56Fe at 50 cGy, no irradiation-induced cortical responses at 1-year post exposure were evident in this study, or in other experiments we have performed in the past.

Between 7–9 days after irradiation, mice were shipped overnight from Brookhaven to NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. Select groups of mice were euthanized and tissues harvested after 35–38 days for 56Fe, 36–39 days for proton, or 36–38 days for the sham (these three groups are deemed 5 weeks post-irradiation and had n = 8 per group) and late (358 or 360 days, here deemed 1 year post-irradiation and had n = 13 per group) for ex vivo osteoprogenitor culture of marrow cells. Tibiae or femora were collected for cancellous microarchitecture assessment with microcomputed tomography. For the 5-week endpoint, osteoblast cultures (n = 6–7 mice/group) were analyzed by real-time qPCR (n = 4 mice/group, see below for details), total DNA quantification, and alkaline phosphatase activity during the proliferative phase (seven days after plating) or the mineralization phase (19–21 days after plating) stages of osteoblast differentiation. At the termination of cultures, mineralized nodules were imaged and analyzed for percent surface area at the end of the culture period. For the 1-year endpoint, osteoblast cultures (n = 6/group) were analyzed for colony number during the proliferative phase (eight days after plating) or for mineralized nodule area during the mineralization phase (28 days after plating) of osteoblast differentiation.",
