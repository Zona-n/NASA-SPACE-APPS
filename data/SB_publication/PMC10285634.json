Spaceflight reduced GSK3β content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3β was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight.",

            "text": "From the first manned flight into space to sending humans to the surface of the moon, we have gained a better appreciation and understanding of the complexities of space travel. Now in the 21st century, current efforts are aimed at a return to the moon, largely in part as preparation for longer duration missions that take humans to Mars for the first time. However, as space exploration advances into new environmental domains, the complications with basic human survival and physiology become even more evident. NASA has identified several hazards of human spaceflight including space radiation, isolation and confinement, distance from earth (and its technological hurdles), exposure to extreme temperatures, pressures, and microgravity. As humans and other mammals have evolved with Earth’s natural gravity, exposure to microgravity with spaceflight can lead to many maladaptive changes, one in particular being a decline in musculoskeletal health and function. The absence of gravity unloads muscles and bones, leading to a reduction in size and strength - akin to aging on Earth. As a result, Space Agencies across the world have focused their attention on developing mitigation strategies to protect musculoskeletal health during space travel, not only to preserve astronaut health and the mission at hand, but also in hopes of developing novel and innovative strategies that may counter aging on Earth.",

            "text": "GSK3 is a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase that has two known isoforms: GSK3α and GSK3β, with the latter being dominant in most tissues. It is a constitutively active enzyme, indicating that it has high protein kinase activity under resting conditions, though it can be inhibited through Ser phosphorylation (Ser21, GSK3α; and Ser9, GSK3β). As both isoforms are structurally similar (95% sequence identity in their catalytic domains), it is not surprising that they also share some functional redundancy, though unique and tissue-specific roles have also been demonstrated. In general, GSK3 is thought to act as a “brake” in many anabolic pathways, including the Wnt/β-catenin and insulin signaling pathways. In the context of the musculoskeletal system, GSK3 is a well-known negative regulator of both muscle and bone mass that not only slows the anabolic pathways but in many cases can also accelerate the catabolic ones.",

Several lines of evidence found here on Earth are in support of this. We have shown that inhibiting GSK3 with lithium can increase myoblast fusion and differentiation and promote osteogenic signaling in bones from mice. Furthermore, patients being treated with lithium for bipolar disorder have been previously shown to have significantly reduced risk of fracture. In addition, an impressive body of work from Dr. Boris Shenkman’s laboratory has shown that GSK3 is more active in muscles after hindlimb suspension (HLS) – a well-accepted simulated microgravity model – and that its inhibition can attenuate the consequential muscle remodeling (for review readers are referred to ref.). Although the evidence from ground-based models suggests that GSK3 may be a viable target against the musculoskeletal decline observed with spaceflight, to our knowledge, there are no studies to date that have investigated this possibility in space. Moreover, the effects of spaceflight, if any, on muscle and bone GSK3 content/signaling remains unknown. This could be an initial first step in firmly establishing GSK3 inhibition as a potential countermeasure.",

We obtained samples from various missions/payloads where male or female mice were exposed to microgravity for 30–37 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) or the BION-M1 biosatellite. In addition to this, we characterized the effects of dual muscle-specific GSK3α/β knockdown on muscle size and strength as well as region-specific (tibia, femur, lumbar spine) bone mineral density (BMD) in response to simulated microgravity via HLS. In doing so, we provide evidence in support of targeting GSK3 to enhance bone and muscle health during spaceflight.",

To summarize the soleus data, we examined the fold-change response in the F group relative to the combined average of the GC and VIV control groups, as no differences were detected between the GC and VIV groups (Figure 1). Across all missions, we observed significant reductions in total GSK3β content (-22-54%) compared with GCVIV control with a combined reduction of 36% (Figure 1A). When examining the overall effect of spaceflight on Ser9 phosphorylated GSK3β content, we found a combined 1.2-fold increase in phosphorylation, however, this was only statistically significant for the BION-M1 and RR18 saline cohorts. Unlike GSK3β content, we did not find a consistent reduction in GSK3α across all missions (Figure 1C). Similarly, we found no combined effect of spaceflight on Ser21 phosphorylation of GSK3α (Figure 1D). Altogether, these findings suggest that spaceflight more prominently affects the GSK3β isoform by reducing its protein levels and, though not consistent for all missions, by also increasing its Ser9 phosphorylation.",

We posited that the reduction in GSK3β found with spaceflight would be largely attributed to the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that occurs within the murine soleus. Across all missions analyzed, there were signs of a slow-to-fast fiber type shift in the soleus after spaceflight with an average 30% and 61% reduction in myosin heavy chain (MHC) I and IIa, respectively (Figures 1E, 1F, S8, and S9). Conversely, we found an average 4-fold and 2.9-fold increase in MHC IIx and IIb isoforms, respectively, in the soleus after spaceflight (Figures 1G, 1H, S8, and S9). The reduction in type IIa is of particular interest as our immunofluorescent microscopy experiments indicate that in the soleus and EDL muscles from otherwise healthy mice (e.g., mobile control), GSK3β is most abundant in the type IIA fibers that are identified with MHC IIa (Figure 2). Thus, the reduction in type IIA fibers found with spaceflight likely accounts for the reduction in GSK3β protein observed with spaceflight.",

However, given that our analyses of GSK3 content was conducted in muscle samples obtained after at least 30 days of spaceflight, we next wanted to determine the effects of GSK3 inhibition before microgravity-induced muscle unloading, and more importantly, before any change in fiber type distribution that would result in lowered GSK3β content. To this end, we employed the NASA developed HLS model to simulate microgravity exposure on Earth. To inhibit GSK3, we used a muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown (GSK3mKD) mouse model previously generated in our lab. These mice display partial knockdown (-40-50%) of both GSK3 isoforms in the soleus (Figure S10). In turn, these mice have significantly larger soleus muscles - both in absolute and relative to body mass terms (Figure S10). Furthermore, dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans show that these mice have lowered body fat % and increased lean mass % (Figure S10).",

However, although GSK3mKD mice had larger soleus muscles after HLS (Figure 3), normalizing the data to mobile controls demonstrated that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS as both GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice experienced a ∼50–60% reduction in absolute soleus mass and a ∼40–50% reduction in normalized soleus mass (Figures 3F and 3G). Nonetheless, soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice were still larger when compared to GSK3flox HLS mice, which was further supported by H&E analysis and a rightward shift in fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) distribution (Figures 3H and 3I). Upon closer inspection, we also found that the GSK3mKD HLS mice had a greater proportion of fibers with centrally located nuclei (Figure 3J), which is indicative of enhanced myogenic repair. Corroborating these findings, myogenic markers Pax7 and myogenin were significantly greater in HLS soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice versus GSK3flox mice (Figure 3K). Furthermore, we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD HLS mice also had greater MHC IIa, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) protein levels versus GSK3mKD HLS mice (Figure 3L). With a significant reduction in MHC IIx (Figure 3L), these results provide evidence for an oxidative fiber type shift with muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown, which is consistent with our previous findings in mice treated with various pharmacological GSK3 inhibitors. In terms of soleus muscle strength, we found that after HLS, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production across submaximal and maximal frequencies (Figure 3M). This effect was not found in a mobile state (Figure 3N), and therefore, calculating the percent reduction in specific force (HLS mice relative to their respective mobile controls), we found that soleus muscles from GSK3mKD mice had significantly greater preservation (e.g. lower % reduction) of force across submaximal and maximal stimulation frequencies (Figure 3O). Altogether, these results show that targeted GSK3 inhibition before muscle unloading can increase soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and the oxidative fiber type while also preserving muscle strength.",

Additional micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of the tibia from these same mice demonstrated decrements in bone structure were apparent in the cortical bone outcomes, whereas no differences in trabecular bone outcomes were evident (Table S2). Specifically, flight mice presented lower cortical area fraction and periosteal perimeter, which was aligned with lower cortical thickness, compared to GCVIV control mice. Western blot analysis revealed a significant reduction in the pGSK3β in the femur compared with GCVIV with no changes in total GSK3β content (Figures 4C–4E).

In the mobile state, we did not find any differences in region-specific BMD between GSK3mKD and GSK3flox mice (Figures 4G and 4H). However, after 7 days of HLS, we found that tibia BMD was greater in GSK3mKD HLS mice versus GSK3flox HLS mice (Figure 4I). A similar result was found in the lumbar spine; albeit, this was not statistically significant (Figure 4I). In terms of tissue crosstalk, we examined the effects of muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown on soleus muscle fibronectin type III domain-containing protein (FNDC5), which is the precursor for the myokine irisin that gets secreted out into circulation with exercise and activation of PGC-1α in muscle. Irisin produced and secreted from muscle can promote bone strength and mass in mice; and has been shown to limit bone loss associated with HLS. Here, we demonstrate that the increase in region-specific BMD found with GSK3mKD was associated with a significant increase in FNDC5 in the soleus (Figure 4J). Though our study is limited in that we did not collect serum to measure irisin levels, we think it is possible that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown could positively impact BMD (particularly in the tibia and lumbar spine) by increasing PGC-1α and FNDC5 in muscle (Figure 4K).",

Indeed, these GSK3 isoforms are encoded by separate genes located on two different chromosomes (Gsk3α, mouse chromosome 7; and Gsk3β, mouse chromosome 18). Furthermore, inhibitory Ser phosphorylation was only enhanced with the GSK3β isoform after spaceflight; albeit not consistently across all missions, whereas Ser phosphorylation of GSK3α was virtually unaltered, which again indicates the two GSK3 isoforms are differentially regulated with spaceflight.",

This is consistent with our previous findings showing that GSK3β is highly expressed in the soleus versus the EDL as the soleus comprises nearly 50% IIA fibers versus the EDL, which only comprises 10% type IIA fibers. Moreover, we previously found greater Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β in the EDL versus the soleus. Alternatively, or perhaps congruently, it is also possible that these changes in GSK3β content and activation may point toward an adaptive/compensatory response aimed at limiting GSK3 activation to limit muscle atrophy and weakness. Providing additional GSK3 inhibition, preferably before the onset of muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type changes may then preserve muscle health and function during spaceflight.",

Our results show that muscle-specific genetic reduction before muscle unloading and the ensuing fiber type shift increased soleus muscle size, myogenic signaling, and preserved muscle strength in the face of HLS. We elected to partially knockdown (-40-50%) both GSK3 isoforms despite the fact that only GSK3β was affected by spaceflight to limit any potential compensatory activation of GSK3α. In a previous study by Pansters et al., sole genetic deletion of Gsk3β appeared to have upregulated protein levels of GSK3α in the murine soleus. In this study, the authors found that genetic knockdown of Gsk3β did not attenuate soleus muscle atrophy in response to HLS, however, they did find an acceleration in muscle recovery with reloading. These findings are consistent with our present results showing that although muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased soleus muscle size, it did not attenuate the level of muscle atrophy observed with HLS, but it did enhance myogenic signaling. Moreover, our findings extend those from Pansters et al. because they did not examine soleus muscle contractile force. In this respect, GSK3mKD mice displayed greater force production versus GSK3flox mice but only after 7 days of HLS and not in the mobile state. This suggests that the effect of GSK3mKD on muscle strength only manifests after an added stress such as HLS; and it further suggests that in the face of HLS, GSK3mKD mice exhibit a preservation of muscle force production that could be important for spaceflight.",

However, one common pathway that is negatively affected in both HLS and spaceflight is myogenesis.

This suggests that the inhibition of GSK3 not only attenuates muscle atrophy and weakness but may also attenuate the slow-to-fast fiber type shift that could lead to decrements in muscle performance and fatigue resistance. These results are not entirely surprising given that we and others have shown that GSK3 inhibition in muscle can promote the oxidative fiber type and PGC-1α content. Moreover, the increase in PGC-1α content in muscle can provide benefits outside of muscle by promoting the expression, production, and release of FNDC5 and irisin. Irisin is a myokine secreted from muscle that can positively impact bone mass and strength even in the face of HLS. Specifically, genetic deletion of irisin in mice severely compromises bone strength and mass with an increased number of osteoclasts, whereas, irisin treatment prevented bone loss with HLS and accelerated bone recovery in response to reloading in mice. Here, we show that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased FNDC5 in muscle while also increasing BMD in the tibia and in the lumbar spine (though not statistically significant in the latter, p = 0.08). Combined with our results showing that GSK3β is overactive in bones (e.g., less inhibitory Ser phosphorylation) from obtained mice subjected to spaceflight, our study provides ample evidence in support of inhibiting GSK3 for the promotion of musculoskeletal health during spaceflight.",

            "text": "In human astronauts, the inhibition of GSK3 before and during spaceflight could be achieved with pharmacological inhibitors such as lithium (Li), which is an already FDA-approved drug. It is most commonly used for the treatment of bipolar disorder; however, because Li also exerts adverse effects when taken at relatively high doses (serum [Li] concentration exceeding 1.0 mM) for a prolonged period of time, it must be prescribed within a narrow therapeutic range (0.5–1.0 mM serum concentration) (for review see ref.). Conversely, we have shown that treating mice with lower doses of Li (serum [Li] of 0.02 mM) increases soleus and EDL muscle specific force production while also promoting PGC-1α and the oxidative fiber type. In cell culture, we have also shown that low dose Li supplementation augments myogenic differentiation and fusion, which could have implications for spaceflight. In fact, pre-treating mice with a low dose of Li (10 mg/kg/day via drinking water) for 4 weeks before unloading the soleus muscle via tenotomy, inhibited GSK3 and increased soleus muscle size even in the face of tenotomy surgery (Figure S10). In addition to muscle, Li has been shown to have osteoprotective effects. In a recent and large epidemiological study, it was found that patients living with bipolar disorder and receiving Li treatment had reduced risk of developing osteoporosis. This is consistent with our findings in mice whereby low dose Li supplementation augmented osteogenic signaling by inhibiting GSK3, which in turn activated the anabolic Wnt/β-catenin pathway. It should be noted that Li has several osteoprotective effects acting on other pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) transduction pathways (for review see). Altogether, the results from our study warrant future investigations with spaceflight and/or HLS to examine the effects of pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 before and during microgravity exposure to further establish whether targeting GSK3 can exert musculoskeletal protection against spaceflight. Undoubtedly, other GSK3 inhibitors aside from Li that are more specific to GSK3 would be important to test and could include drugs like tideglusib, which is the most clinically advanced GSK3 inhibitor currently being tested for other diseases and conditions. We have recently shown that tideglusib treatment can preserve muscle size, strength, and quality in dystrophic mice.",

Although the RR1 mission was conducted in female mice, the limitation in sample size prevented us from truly examining any potential influence of biological sex. Future studies, with age-matched male and female mice, preferably part of the same mission, are required to better elucidate the potential sex-specific effects of spaceflight on the musculoskeletal system. Our study was also limited in that we were not able to obtain bone samples from all missions, and thus our analysis was restricted to the RR9 mission. Within this mission, μCT analyses of the tibia indicated that cortical bone was primarily affected by spaceflight. However, we suspect that limitations in sample size prevented us from detecting a statistically significant effect on trabecular bone. Indeed, previous μCT analyses in the lumbar vertebrae and femur from the BION-M1 mission showed significant reductions in trabecular bone outcomes in the F group versus GC and VIV controls. In muscle, where we obtained samples from RR9, RR1, RR18, and BION-M1 missions, we utilized a “meta-analytical” approach with the fold-change response as the common measure of effect size. However, differences in experimental conditions (i.e., food, temperature, pressure, strain differences, age differences, and etc.) should not be discounted. These differences could have contributed to the differences in phosphorylation status of GSK3, where we found significant increases in Ser phosphorylation of GSK3 in BION-M1 and RR18 F soleus muscles but not in any other soleus muscles from RR1 or RR9. Finally, our study is limited in that we did not assess the effects of bone-specific Gsk3 deletion on BMD and strength in response to HLS. Future studies should generate these mice and perform these experiments to firmly establish whether GSK3 inhibition before simulated microgravity exposure can protect against bone loss. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that inhibiting GSK3 specifically in muscle may exert positive effects on the bone thereby highlighting a muscle-to-bone connection that would likely be activated with whole-body GSK3 inhibition afforded through pharmacological means.",

In addition, future studies that examine the effects of pharmacological, and thus, whole-body GSK3 inhibition before and during spaceflight should also be done in mice.

For all missions, we were provided with 3 experimental groups: 1) Flight (F) group housed in specialized mission hardware; 2) Ground control (GC) housed in specialized mission hardware here on Earth; and 3) Vivarium (VIV) control housed in standard laboratory cages and conditions. For the BION-M1 mission, male C57BL/6N (19–20 week old at time of launch) mice were maintained in high-orbit (∼550 km) for 30 days in specialized flight modules. For the NASA missions, male C57BL/6J (RR9 and RR18, 10 weeks of age at time of launch) and female C57BL/6J (RR1, 16 weeks of age at time of launch) mice were acclimated and then launched in a specialized transporter and transferred to Rodent Habitats on board the International Space Station (ISS). Additional details on housing and tissue collection/preparation can be found elsewhere for RR1, RR9, and BION-M1. For the RR18 mission, flight mice were aboard the ISS for 30 days with weekly injections of either sterile saline (0.9%) or the antioxidant metalloporphyrin (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+, herein referred to as BuOE). The mice used in this study were part of a live animal return cohort where tissue dissection occurred 1 day after landing. Soleus muscles were collected and stored in RNAlater at −80°C, prior to being homogenized in PMSF buffer (250 mM Sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM PMSF, 0.2% NaN3 (pH 7.5)). We did not find any differences in GSK3 content or MHC isoform expression between the two saline and BuOE cohorts, and thus we elected to keep them separate in our analysis.",

Owing to Hurricane Irma (September 2017), the original RR9 GC and VIV experiments were terminated early. GC and VIV experiments were replicated in May 2018 using the same strain of mice used for the flight experiment. With the new GC and VIV groups, an additional set of mice were used as cohort controls to assess variation because of differences in time. That is, the mice originally dedicated to serve as the VIV group in 2017 were labeled as cohort 1, and another set of age- and sex-matched mice were run as cohort 2 under similar treatments in 2018. Thus, differences in GSK3 expression and activation were first examined in R9 cohort controls to determine if a normalizing factor would be required. Importantly, we found no differences in GSK3 phosphorylation in the TA muscles from Cohort Control 1 (CC1) and Cohort Control 2 (CC2) (Figure S12). We also found no significant differences between cohort controls (CC1 vs. CC2) in any of the bone outcomes measured (Table S3).",

Heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice also heterozygously expressing ACTA-1 Cre were considered GSK3mKD, whereas heterozygously floxed GSK3α/β mice without ACTA-1 Cre were considered the flox control (GSK3flox). For the lithium feeding experiments, male 3–6 month old C57BL/6 mice were used. All mice were fed a standard chow diet (2014 Teklad global, 14% protein rodent maintenance diet, Harlan Teklad, Mississauga, ON), and were kept on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water through the entirety of the study.

For the western blot data across the individual experiments (Figures S1–S3, S5, and S6), a one-way ANOVA or non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test with a Dunnet’s post-hoc test was used to strictly compare GC vs. Flight and VIV vs. Flight. This method was chosen since no significant differences between GC and VIV for any outcome measure related to muscle were detected for any mission. Similarly, for the bone analysis (DXA, μCT, and western blot analyses) GC and VIV controls were combined as there were no differences between the two groups. This was done to increase statistical power. A Student’s t test was then used to make comparisons between F and GCVIV. For the GSK3mKD experiments, most comparisons were made Student’s t test unless otherwise stated where a two-way ANOVA was used. For the lithium and tenotomy experiments, a two-way ANOVA was also used to test the main effects of lithium treatment and tenotomy. All data are presented as mean +/− standard error unless stated otherwise. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test for normality for both studies.
