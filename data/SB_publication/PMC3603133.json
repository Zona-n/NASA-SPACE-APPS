The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24 hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.",

Changes in endothelial hemostasis have also been associated with post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance. Hence understanding functioning of the vascular endothelium becomes critical for different diseases pathogenesis. The healthy endothelium maintains a critical relationship with the outside environment through the blood and hemodynamic forces. This relationship is governed by a well-studied frictional force: shear stress. Regulation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) responses to shear stress involve a complex cascades of gene responses with different temporal profiles and shear stress impacts ECs morphology, function and gene expression, the latter taking place transcriptionally and/or post-trancriptionally. In fact, DNA microarray analysis has demonstrated that 3% of all genes responded to shear stress. If ECs express 20,000 genes, then approximately 600 would be responsive to shear stress.",

The cells respond to rapid laminar flow by becoming spindle-shaped and aligned with their long axis parallel to the direction of blood flow. This is accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress. When flow is turbulent or stagnant, the cells become rounder in shape and do not have a uniform orientation. Hence, the cytoskeleton is critical in sensing mechanical forces, with a change in their morphology leading to changes in inflammation and atherogenesis.",

It is thought that “sensing” of mechanical forces and shear stress signal transduction through the cytoskeleton take place, at least partially through caveolae. The caveolae are membrane microdomains measuring approximately 50–10 nm in length that are visible as flask-shaped invaginations below the surface of cells, containing many signaling molecules. In response to increased flow, calcium gradients develop close to caveolae and propagate through the entire cell in the form of a calcium wave. The calcium increase close to caveolae causes the caveolae to rapidly liberate the nitric oxide (NO) synthase eNOS into the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the production of NO. Caveolins have also been reported to be involved in the early phases of atherosclerosis with absence of caveolin-1 in mice characterized by impaired blood-flow-dependent vascular remodeling and vasodilator responses.",

The effects of gravitational forces on mechanotransduction in ECs responses have been the matter of only a few investigations and remain largely unknown. It is well known that astronauts experience cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight manifested among others as orthostatic intolerance, and some investigators have suggested that the nitric oxide system is involved in these changes. At the physiological level, we demonstrated changes in the cardiovascular system with simulated microgravity characterized by alterations in sympathetic function, the renin-angiotensin system and electrolyte excretion. Overall, understanding the effects of gravitational mechanical forces is important as mechanical unloading (MU) of cells has been shown to alter cell cytoskeleton, affect caveolae and eNOS. If shear stress can affect the cytoskeleton, cell function and expression, can gravitational mechanical forces do the same? Since caveolins are gravity-sensing elements and eNOS is tightly related to inflammation and cell-cell interaction including adhesion, could microgravity have the potential to alter processes such as inflammation and cell-to-cell interaction?",

It appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells, such as the caveolins to the caveolae at the plasma membrane. Cells are known to stabilize their structure and shape by means of interconnected network of cytoskeletal components including microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. In vitro, when subjected to shear stress in a flow-loading device, net cellular movement happens orienting them in the direction of the shear stress, a phenomenon accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress.",

Buravkova et al demonstrated changes in the cytoskeleton of HUVECs within 1–2 hours of simulated microgravity with actin filament thinning and their redistribution to cell borders (with the central area becoming practically free of actin fibers while there was formation of continuous F-actin band at the intercellular contact area). Siamwala demonstrated that 2 hours of simulated microgravity in EAhy926 ECs lead to actin rearrangements and increase in nitric oxide production. Versari et al also showed that HUVECs in microgravity for 96 hours had disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a decrease in the total amount of actin. Infanger et al. showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity had altered cytoskeletal components and the formation of cell aggregates in the monolayer after 12 hours. Carlsson et al also demonstrated disorganization of the actin fibers with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus up to 96 hr in simulated microgravity, then disappearing after 144 hours. Grimm et al showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity formed tubular structures that actually had an increased amount of actin that covered the entire surface of the tubular structure.",

For example, integrins have been shown to be decreased during parabolic flight in HUVECs. The expression of fibronectin has been found to be increased with simulated microgravity in EA.hy.926. Tube-shaped structures of EA.hy.926 forming after 2 weeks of simulated microgravity produced more fibronectin. Although not demonstrated in endothelial cells to our knowledge, Rho GAP expression has been found to be increased two fold with spaceflight in rat osteoblasts, suggesting that microgravity suppress Rho signals regulating actin filament rearrangement. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in shear-stress-induced NO production and ICAM-1 gene expression by ECs with shear stress, it could then be expected that MU also alters expression of eNOS, inflammatory and adhesion molecules.",

With regards to NO production, two studies showed an increase in eNOS protein levels and increased NO production at 48 hours and 72 hours respectively. However, Spisni et al. found no change in eNOS or iNOS protein levels yet an increase in NO production at 24 hours. Ulbrich et al. actually found decreased eNOS gene expression at 24 hours.

Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall “dysregulation” of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels.

After 3 washes in PBS, cells were mounted using Permount histological mounting medium (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and imaged using a Zeiss Axioscope Fluorescent Microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany) camera and a (Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridge-water, NJ USA) fluorescent microscope.",
