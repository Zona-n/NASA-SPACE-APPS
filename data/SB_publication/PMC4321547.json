They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.",

Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins. Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, see).",

Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions. They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses. Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H2O2. Although it is toxic, H2O2 also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses. To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled.",

They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells. PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast. RMV1/PUT3 has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake in Arabidopsis.

These RILs were previously characterized for genotypic contribution from the two parental lines along the five chromosomes. For both the parental lines and the RILs, root growth on medium containing cadaverine compared with growth on control plates lacking this compound was quantified. RIL mean root length ratios showed transgression with respect to the parental means (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, growth on 0 μM and 50 μM cadaverine displayed broad sense heritability values of 0.46 and 0.56, respectively.

Rescue line 1 had significantly higher OCT1 expression compared with the WS wild type, whereas rescue line 2 had a similar level of OCT1 expression (Fig. 5A).

To determine if differences in OCT1 expression among other natural accessions also correlate with variability in cadaverine sensitivity, OCT1 expression was measured in two other accessions, one resistant to cadaverine (Knox-18) and one sensitive to cadaverine (Sq-8). It was found that both lines had higher OCT1 expression than Ler even though only Knox-18 was more resistant to cadaverine than Ler. Furthermore, Sq-8 displayed higher OCT1 expression than Knox-18 despite being more sensitive to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online). The OCT1 sequences of the eight natural accessions initially selected for the analysis of cadaverine response were also compared. Polymorphisms shared among the three most resistant accessions (Cvi-1, Knox-18, and Ull2-3) or the three most sensitive accessions (An-1, Ler-2, and Sq-8) were not seen (Supplementary Table S2). Together, these data suggest that factors other than OCT1 expression may also contribute significantly to differential cadaverine sensitivity among these accessions.",

Ler root length is highly sensitive to cadaverine, whereas Columbia root length is less sensitive to it. In general, the Columbia plants showed a range of responses to cadaverine regardless of the accession from which the transgene was derived (Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online). This result is similar to that obtained when these constructs were transformed into the oct1-1 mutant (Fig. 6). In contrast, when these constructs were transformed into Ler plants, the tested lines generally did not show increased resistance to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, the ability of OCT1 to affect the cadaverine response may depend on the genetic background.",

            "text": "It was found that Arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession. In general, when cadaverine concentrations increased, a reduction in root length as well as alterations in skewing, lateral root branching, and root waving were seen. The reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell division and expansion. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 1 that at least partially explains the root length difference in response to cadaverine between Cvi and Ler. By comparing phenotypes and gene expression in natural accessions, a mutant, and transgenic lines, OCT1 was identified as a key gene involved in this response. Restoring OCT1 expression in the mutant background resulted in a positive correlation between OCT1 expression levels and cadaverine resistance. Because the OCT1 expression levels in other natural accessions do not correlate well with cadaverine resistance, other genes are also likely to contribute to the variation of this trait between Arabidopsis accessions. These genes could contribute to endogenous cadaverine homeostasis, transport, and/or response. Unfortunately, the levels of endogenous cadaverine in Arabidopsis seedling roots and shoots were below the level of detection using HPLC methods, preventing a distinction from being made between these possibilities.",

In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues. Most are polyspecific, and transport can occur in either direction (for a review, see). Arabidopsis OCT1 is one of six OCT-like proteins in Arabidopsis. It was previously reported to localize to the plasma membrane, and promoter–β-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions showed activity in the vasculature of many organs including roots. Because the other six OCT-like proteins localize to the tonoplast rather than the plasma membrane, it is likely that OCT1 has a different function.",

Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. One possibility is that OCT1 transports cadaverine away from elongating root cells and through the vasculature, causing it to accumulate in aerial tissues. Alternatively, cadaverine may alter the transport of another molecule through the membranes. Polyamines block many kinds of channels in multiple organisms. For example, spermine and spermidine directly block fast vacuolar cation channels in barley, and all natural polyamines including cadaverine can regulate cation channel activity through cytoplasmic pathways.",
