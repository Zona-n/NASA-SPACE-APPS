            "text": "Long-duration spaceflight missions face challenges due to a variety of factors, including high vacuum, intense radiation, and low magnitude of gravity. Microgravity exposure is the main difficulty that needs to be overcome in real time, which causes astronauts to be in sub-health for a long time, affecting flight tasks and physical fitness. Several studies have shown that microgravity is closely related to health problems such as immune system disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, and skeletal muscle loss. Intestinal microecology plays an important role in mediating the decline in these functions. Under weightlessness conditions, the intestine directly suffers from structural damage caused by various stress factors, including disruption of intestinal barrier integrity and gut microbiota imbalance. Moreover, the gut also regulates immune function and affects signal transduction between the host and intestinal microorganisms by producing intestinal microbial metabolites such as SCFAs. Evidence from animal experiments has reported serious intestinal barrier damage under weightlessness simulation, including typical intestinal villi injury, downregulation of tight junction protein expression, cell apoptosis, and increased intestinal permeability. Similarly, shortened intestinal villi, shallower crypt depth, and reduced mucin production in intestinal epithelial cells were observed in spaceflight rats. Recent data also show that the fluctuation of intestinal flora caused by weightlessness will lead to the imbalance of the immune system and increase the risk of opportunistic infection. A study revealed that weightlessness caused change in the ratio of Bacteroides to Firmicutes, which may lead to the production of inflammatory cytokines by activating pattern recognition receptors. In addition, microbiota metabolites also participate in the pathological changes of the digestive system related to spaceflight stress and play a role in the body signal transduction. Evidence shows that long-duration space flight significantly changes the gastrointestinal microbiota and related microbial metabolites of astronauts. The exploration based on animal experiments has also identified changes in intestinal metabolome such as amino acids and short-chain fatty acids, which are related to immune dysfunction and intestinal flora disorders. Thus, it is necessary to monitor intestinal microecological disorders caused by weightlessness and to discover related protective strategies to ensure the health of astronauts.",

As a perennial plant with homology of medicine and food, ginseng has been used for thousands of years in many countries to maintain health. Ginseng total saponins (GTSs), a bioactive compound in ginseng, is responsible for most of the immunological and pharmacological activities of ginseng. According to previous records, GTSs have health benefits in regulating intestinal homeostasis, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-central nervous system diseases, and in maintaining immunity. In particular, the effects of GTSs on intestinal immune regulation and inhibition of inflammation have been confirmed. GTSs are also beneficial for increasing the diversity of the gut microbiota, enhancing the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides) and reducing the production of pathogenic bacteria (iron-removing bacteria, Helicobacter pylori) to enhance host health. In addition, the monomeric constituents of ginseng (including ginsenosides Rb1, Rg1, Rk3, and Re) can remodel the composition of the intestinal flora or modulate flora metabolites, thereby causing different effects on the intestinal barrier function, immune function, and host homeostasis.",

The quality control data with reliable base calling are listed in Table S4. The rarefaction curve indicated that the amount of sequencing data obtained in this study was reasonable (Figure S2). Alpha diversity, based on Shannon’s analysis, was used to characterize the species diversity of the microbial communities. Strikingly, a sequential decrease in microbiota composition was observed in the HLS and GTSs groups (Figure 4A). However, there were differences in the relative abundance of dominant flora among the experimental groups, especially at the phylum and genus levels. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the fecal samples of all groups, and GTSs may have restored the relative abundance of these two species in rats subjected to weightlessness. Similarly, GTSs had modulatory effects on the dominant genera in the three groups, including Lactobacillus, Tumorcoccus, Oscillospira and All0baculum (Figure 4B). Furthermore, the Anosim test showed significant intergroup differences in bacterial community structure, and NMDS analysis was used to assess this change (Figure 4C). To further identify the most significant differential microbiota between the experimental groups, corresponding LEfSe analysis was performed (Figure 4D). The results showed that Prevotella, Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium and Jeotgalicoccus were the dominant bacteria in the model group, and their relative abundance was significantly reduced after GTSs intervention (Table S5). In addition, compared with the CON group, Lactobacillus, Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli were identified as the major contributing flora in the GTSs group. These results suggest that GTSs have a dual modulatory effect on the gut microbial composition and abundance in simulated weightless rats. KEGG function prediction revealed that GTSs may be involved in signaling molecules and interactions, energy metabolism, immune function, and the nervous system by affecting the intestinal flora (Figure 4E).

            "text": "Long-term microgravity exposure causes adverse effects on the immune system. The innate immune system, which is composed of granulocytes, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells, is the first line of defense for the body to initiate self-protection. It can not only recognize invading pathogens, but also sense and interact with the environment. Previous reports have suggested that more than 50% of astronauts on the first manned missions showed increased susceptibility to microbial infections caused by impaired innate immune systems. In addition, recent studies have further demonstrated that microgravity can impair the differentiation, function and signal transduction of innate immune cells. For example, the analysis of peripheral blood from astronauts showed that space flight would lead to impaired cell migration and antigen presentation mediated by monocytes in innate immunity. The intestinal innate immune system encompasses barrier defenses serviced by the epithelial cell layer, as well as bactericidal immune cell populations, including macrophages and neutrophils. Breakdowns in intestinal homeostasis driven by weightlessness are related to immune system perturbations. Intestinal immune cells are distributed in the intestinal epithelium, lamina propria, and lymphoid tissue. Mesenteric lymph nodes (MLD), which are located in lymphoid tissues, are sites of intestinal adaptive immune responses induced by intestinal microbiomes and mediate inflammatory responses. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are also important contributors. In this study, GTSs significantly increased the proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in MLD and improved the CD4+ /CD8+ ratio, suggesting that GTSs could enhance the cell-mediated immune response of MLD and the intestinal immune barrier. In addition, transcriptomic analysis identified innate immune pathways significantly associated with HLS and confirmed the downregulation of immune-related genes (Ly6e, Isg15 and Ifi27l2b) in the HLS group. To validate this outcome, we performed RT-PCR analysis and obtained similar results. Interestingly, GTSs effectively reversed the expression of these genes, suggesting its therapeutic potential. Ly6e exhibits transcriptional activity in numerous tissues, including the liver and intestine. Importantly, the biological functions of Ly6e have been linked to immunoregulatory functions, particularly T-cell proliferation and activation. Ly6e-loaded DCS effectively stimulated T Cell subsets and significantly increased the proportion of Th1 cells, which play an important role in colorectal cancer with immune cell infiltration. Interferon alpha inducible protein 27 (IFI27), including Ifi2712b, is responsible for a variety of biological processes including innate immunity and apoptosis. Liu et al investigated the protective effects of the poria cocos-derived polysaccharide, CMP33, against IBD and identified multiple regulatory genes including Ifi27l2b. Slfn4 belongs to the Schlafen (SLFNs) family, a family of proteins strongly induced by type 1 interferons (IFN-α) and has been implicated in myeloid cell differentiation, proliferation, and immune responses. Although much attention has been paid to the antiviral properties of Isg15, recent reports have also suggested that uncoupled Isg15 may act as a signalling molecule to stimulate immunomodulatory responses, such as neutrophil chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory cytokines. Our results showed that the expression of these genes significantly increased after GTSs treatment, suggesting that GTSs can protect intestinal immunity in a weightless environment.",

Previous studies described the effects of weightlessness on these factors. Jin et al indicated that impaired intestinal mucosal barrier function caused by weightlessness is closely related to the intestinal villi and tight junction structures. In several tail-suspension rat models, researchers have observed typical pathologic features, such as intestinal villus shedding, decreased number of goblet cells, and inflammatory cell infiltration. At the same time, the expression levels of tight junction proteins were significantly decreased and inflammatory cytokines were increased. Similar changes were observed in the gene expression levels of tight junction proteins (claudin and occludin) and pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). HE staining confirmed the pathological injury of the small intestine in the HLS group, as well as the recovery potential of GTSs. Moreover, deficiency in mucin synthesis and secretion by goblet cells directly leads to intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction. GTSs effectively restored the reduction in goblet cells caused by weightlessness, which is another factor that supports the protective function of the intestinal barrier.",

For both endemic flora present only in the HLS group (Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus, g-prevotella, Corynebacterium, Jeotgalicoccus) and flora with variations in abundance (Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus), GTSs showed strong positive regulatory effects. Staphylococcus is an opportunistic pathogen that enhances intestinal permeability of intestine. Similarly, Prevotella colonization exacerbates intestinal inflammation and systemic autoimmune diseases. Lactobacillus has been identified as a versatile probiotic that participates in improving intestinal barrier function, immune regulation, metabolic regulation, and other biological processes. Clinically, Lactobacillus has been used to ameliorate intestinal disorders such as diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. Recent studies have shown that changes in the abundance of lactobacilli, ruminococcus, and Oscillospira directly affect intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and macrophage dysfunction. Notably, GTSs treatment reduced the abundance of these potentially pathogenic bacteria while increasing the content of beneficial bacteria, which is beneficial for maintaining gut microbial homeostasis and protecting host health. In addition, we found that GTSs independently regulated Lactobacillaceae and Bacilli, which have been shown to be beneficial for regulating intestinal immunity or inflammation. Taken together, these results indicate that GTSs can effectively restore the intestinal flora disorders induced by simulated microgravity. KEGG function prediction also confirmed that these bacteria are involved in immune processes.",

Acetic acid not only provides an important energy source for host cells but also protects intestinal epithelial cells by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins, thereby reducing intestinal permeability. Propionic acid can regulate intestinal inflammation, tight junction proteins, and mucin production to maintain the intestinal barrier function. Butyric acid has been shown to have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, which is closely related to intestinal permeability. In the present study, weightlessness caused a significant reduction in the levels of these SCFAs, which were antagonized by GTSs. A strong correlation was observed between butyric acid-Jeotgalicoccus and butyric acid-Prevotella. As a harmful bacterium, GTSs intervention reduced the abundance of Jeotgalicoccus in vivo, while the butyric acid content increased at the metabolic level, which confirmed the rationality of their negative correlation. Prevotella is directly related to butyric acid synthesis in vivo. Notably, our results showed inconsistent trends between Prevotella and butyric acid, which might be related to the regulatory effects of GTSS on other butyric acid-producing bacteria. These results further highlight the potential role of GTSs in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. Based on this result, we will conduct more detailed experiments to investigate the specific regulatory pathways of GTSs on intestinal immunity, gut microbiota and microbiota metabolites. It will help to investigate the effects of natural ingredients from food on the health and homeostasis of astronauts, and to play a better role in the operated spaceflight business.",
