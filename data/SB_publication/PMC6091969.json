Exactly how immune mechanisms control A. fumigatus in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different A. fumigatus strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better in vivo than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 pyrG-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of A. fumigatus and highlight the ability of different A. fumigatus strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.",

However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus from the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system clears this infection is still obscure. Additionally, there are many different strains of A. fumigatus, and whether the pathogenesis of these different strains varies is also largely unknown. To investigate these questions, we infected larval zebrafish with A. fumigatus spores derived from two genetically diverse strains. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. We find that differences in the rate of growth between strains directly affect fungal persistence. In both wild-type and macrophage-deficient zebrafish larvae, a fast-germinating strain is actually cleared better than a slow-germinating strain. This fungal killing is driven primarily by neutrophils while macrophages promote fungal persistence by inhibiting spore germination. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can utilize—rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence—and inform future strategies for fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients.",

Immunocompromised patients, however, especially acute leukemia patients, hematopoietic cell transplant recipients, and solid-organ transplant recipients, are at risk of developing invasive aspergillosis. In invasive disease, Aspergillus spores germinate into filamentous hyphae and invade and destroy tissues and organs, with mortality rates as high as 50 to 60% in patient populations. Limited antifungal treatments exist and there is growing resistance among fungi to these drugs.

In vivo, however, the requirement for and role of macrophages is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect on survival in macrophage-depleted mice and others demonstrating an increased fungal burden in such mice. Neutrophils, on the other hand, are consistently required in mice in response to Aspergillus, and neutropenia is a key risk factor for patients in the development of invasive aspergillosis. Neutrophils can kill conidia in vivo and inhibit conidial germination both in vitro and in vivo. Immune cell populations can also influence the activity of other immune cell types, and CCR2+ inflammatory monocytes can increase neutrophil function in response to Aspergillus through pro-inflammatory gene expression.

While murine models require enormous fungal inoculums (~107 conidia) and host immunosuppression in order to directly visualize immune cell-pathogen encounters within the context of host tissue, the larval zebrafish allows for visualization of smaller doses (10–100 conidia) in wild-type hosts. Aspergillus infection models in zebrafish have already been developed by our lab and others and recapitulate many aspects of human and mouse infection, including initial phagocytosis of conidia by macrophages and post-germination neutrophil recruitment.

To investigate such clearance, we decided to apply a published method to visually quantify Aspergillus spore killing, to our established model of Aspergillus infection in transparent zebrafish larvae, giving us the ability to visualize fungal killing in a live, intact host. This live-dead staining method utilizes Aspergillus strains expressing a fluorescent protein (in these experiments, YFP or GFP) and coated in an AlexaFluor molecule of a different color (here, AlexaFluor594). Live spores are visualized as YFP/GFP signal surrounded by AlexaFluor signal, while killed spores appear as AlexaFluor signal only. We used strains derived from Af293 and CEA10 that express YFP and GFP, tagged to cytosolic proteins. Throughout this paper we will refer to Af293-derived and CEA10-derived strains in the text and figures as simply Af293 and CEA10, respectively, for ease of discussion, but we list actual strains used for each experiment in figure legends and the details of all strains in Methods.",

Confocal imaging of these larvae 2 days post injection (dpi) revealed that CEA10 is killed significantly better than Af293, with a higher percentage of dual-labeled AlexaFluor594+, YFP/GFP+ spores in an Af293 infection compared to a CEA10 infection (Fig 1B and 1C). These results were surprising to us given that CEA10 has been reported to be more virulent than Af293 in some immunosuppressed mouse models of infection as well as in data from our lab in neutrophil-defective zebrafish larvae. To confirm this difference in fungal killing, we quantified colony-forming units (CFUs) from homogenized single larvae over the course of a 5 day infection. This experiment recapitulated the finding that fungal burden of this CEA10 strain is controlled significantly better by larval zebrafish than the Af293 strain (Fig 1D). While Af293 persists in larvae throughout the course of infection, CEA10 is slowly cleared, so that by 2 dpi, the fungal burden in CEA10-infected larvae is significantly lower than that of Af293-infected larvae. Additionally, by 3 dpi, CEA10 fungal burden is significantly less than the initial dose. Af293 is never significantly cleared compared to the initial burden under the experimental conditions. We also confirmed that this trend holds for multiple Af293- and CEA10-derived strains, as well as the parental strains (S1 Fig).",

Neither Af293 nor CEA10 caused much death in control larvae, consistent with previous results in our zebrafish model and the idea that wild-type hosts can largely control Aspergillus infection. Treatment with dexamethasone, however, caused both Af293- and CEA10-infected larvae to succumb rapidly and equally to infection (Fig 2C), consistent with the identical virulence of these two strains observed in a chemotherapeutic mouse model. Control PBS-injected larvae treated with dexamethasone had minimal death (S2A Fig). Similar results were obtained after treatment with withaferin A, a non-specific inhibitor of NF-κB (S2B Fig). These results suggest that while CEA10 infection induces significantly more activation of NF-κB, under general immunosuppressive conditions, neither of these strains can be controlled by the host.",

Myd88 is an adaptor molecule downstream of TLR/IL-1R signaling that has previously been implicated in the response to Aspergillus. myd88-/- larvae are more susceptible to CEA10, but not Af293, infection compared to wild-type controls (Fig 2D), consistent with the idea that Myd88-mediated immune activation is required specifically for the response to CEA10. This increase in susceptibility to a CEA10 strain of myd88-/- larvae coincided with a significantly decreased ability to clear CEA10 fungal burden, while loss of Myd88 had no effect on Af293 fungal burden (Fig 2E and 2F). Knockdown of myd88 did not inhibit activation of the NF-κB RE:EGFP reporter line by a CEA10-derived strain (S2C and S2D Fig). This is could be due to 1) other pathways that also activate NF-κB and/or 2) increased fungal growth in these larvae resulting in more inflammation. Together, these results show that CEA10 induces a more robust inflammatory response than Af293 and Myd88-dependent signaling is required for clearance of CEA10 fungal burden.",

By following individual larvae with both labeled macrophage nuclei (mpeg1:mcherry-H2B) and neutrophils (lyz:BFP) throughout a 5 day infection, we aimed to determine both differences in immune cell recruitment within larvae over time and population-level differences between larvae infected with a CEA10-derived strain versus an Af293-derived strain. On a population level, CEA10 infection recruited more macrophages and neutrophils than Af293 infection, throughout the entire time course (Fig 4A and 4B). These differences were significant as early as 2 dpi and up to 5 dpi (Fig 4A and 4B). However, the number of macrophages and neutrophils present at the site of infection was also dynamic, fluctuating from day to day in individual larvae (Fig 4A and 4B). In general, immune cell recruitment peaked at 2 dpi, decreasing slowly afterwards, coinciding with the timeline of fungal clearance (Fig 1D).",

These clusters were primarily made up of macrophages, but neutrophils also infiltrated, generally arriving after macrophages (Figs 4C and S4A). These macrophages form tight associations, with their membranes directly opposed and without space between the cells (Fig 4E). Germination of A. fumigatus spores inside the clusters could be found (S4A Fig). We also observed the apical extrusion of a cluster out of the hindbrain of two larvae, suggesting extrusion is a possible but rare mechanism for the host to eliminate the infection (S4B Fig). Quantification of phagocyte cluster size demonstrates that significantly larger clusters form in response to CEA10 compared to Af293, consistent with differences in observed numbers of phagocytes recruited (Fig 4C and 4D). Additionally, the size of these clusters is dynamic, changing in individual larvae throughout the course of infection, but also peaking at 2 dpi and decreasing in size as the infection is cleared (Fig 4C and 4D).",

These larvae express a dominant-negative copy of Rac2 under a neutrophil-specific promoter, preventing the migration of neutrophils out of the vasculature. Consistent with previous observations (Fig 1), an Af293-derived strain was not significantly cleared in either neutrophil-defective or control hosts (Fig 5A). However, 2 dpi, neutrophil-defective larvae are able to decrease fungal burden of a CEA10-derived strain equivalently to the control, to ~60% of the initial dose (Fig 5A), indicating that early in infection macrophages have a low-level killing ability against CEA10. However, at 3 dpi, CFUs from these neutrophil-defective larvae increase, demonstrating that macrophages alone cannot contain the growth of CEA10 (Fig 5A). Because these larvae have fewer functional immune cells in total, we also tested a lower dose of CEA10, but found that the infectious dose did not have any effect on percent of fungal clearance (S5 Fig).",

This calculation revealed that while neutrophil-defective larvae are significantly more susceptible to both Af293 and CEA10 infections than control larvae, these hosts are ~3 times more likely to succumb to CEA10 infection than Af293 infection (Fig 5B), consistent with our previous results in this zebrafish line.

However, larvae injected with clodronate liposomes also cleared a CEA10-derived strain, but not an Af293-derived strain, significantly better than control PBS liposome-injected larvae at 1 dpi (Fig 6C). As clodronate liposome injection specifically depletes macrophages without affecting neutrophils (S6A Fig), this result suggests that this increased early clearance is a specific consequence of macrophage depletion. Clodronate liposome-injected larvae do however succumb to infection (Figs 6D and S6B), indicating either that a larger number of neutrophils is required for complete fungal clearance and host survival in the absence of macrophages, and/or that clodronate liposomes affect neutrophil function without altering neutrophil numbers. These data demonstrate that the presence of macrophages actually protects injected CEA10 spores, but not Af293 spores, from neutrophil-mediated killing at early time points after infection, and suggest that macrophages might provide a protective niche for survival of certain fungal strains.",

Since neutrophils have been reported to respond specifically to hyphal forms of A. fumigatus, we hypothesized that macrophages inhibit spore germination. Indeed, the massive neutrophil recruitment we observed in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae was often accompanied by fungal germination and hyphal growth (Fig 7A). In fact, the percentage of larvae with hyphae present was higher in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient hosts compared to wild-type hosts after infection with either an Af293-derived or a CEA10-derived strain (Fig 7D), suggesting that the presence of macrophages inhibits A. fumigatus germination. Similar results were seen in clodronate liposome-injected larvae (S7A Fig). Previous experiments also suggest this rate of germination may be an underestimate for CEA10 infection since this fungus is cleared so effectively in irf8-/- macrophage-deficient conditions (Fig 6A). These data suggest that in the absence of macrophages, fungal germination induces signals that recruit neutrophils.",

Given our previous observation that the signaling molecule Myd88 is required for full clearance of a CEA10 strain (Fig 2F), we hypothesized that Myd88 is involved in neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection after spore germination. While Myd88 has been shown to be dispensable for neutrophil-intrinsic anti-fungal activity, it can be required in other cell types such as epithelial cells for neutrophil recruitment to A. fumigatus infections. To determine if neutrophil-mediated killing of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages requires Myd88 signaling, we combined the myd88-/- mutant line with macrophage-deficiency (irf8 morpholino). We performed CFU counts at just 1 dpi since neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 in the absence of macrophages occurs rapidly (Fig 6A). Consistent with previous results, at 1 dpi CEA10 is not cleared in wild-type hosts, while Irf8 deficiency alone led to significantly increased clearance (Figs 7E and S7B). However, we observed virtually identical clearance in macrophage-deficient hosts that also lacked Myd88 (Figs 7E and S7B). These data demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil-mediated killing of germinated spores of a CEA10-derived strain, but instead that neutrophil activation signals are likely transduced through other pathways.",

CEA10 has been shown to germinate faster than Af293 in liquid culture in vitro and more germinated spores of CEA10 compared to Af293 were found in the lungs of infected mice, but germination rates of these two strains have not been directly measured in vivo. To measure fungal growth in vivo, we infected both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient (pu.1 morphant) larvae with YFP- or GFP-expressing spores of strains derived from either CEA10 or Af293. Phagocyte-deficient larvae succumb quickly to infection with either strain, but on average CEA10 infection results in death one day earlier than Af293 infection (Fig 8A), suggesting CEA10 grows faster in vivo. Similar results were obtained with several CEA10- and Af293-derived strains (S8 Fig). To directly monitor fungal development and growth over time, we imaged these larvae every day for five days of infection (or until larvae succumbed). After only 1 day of infection, we observed pervasive growth of CEA10 in phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8B). While both Af293 and CEA10 spores had germinated after 1 day, CEA10 had already developed invasive hyphae throughout the hindbrain. We quantified how long it took individual larvae to exhibit both germinated spores (Fig 8C) and invasive hyphae (Fig 8D). These data confirmed that CEA10 both germinates significantly faster and grows into invasive hyphae significantly faster than Af293 in both wild-type and phagocyte-deficient hosts (Fig 8C and 8D). Quantification of fungal burden by measuring GFP+ area from these images also reflected greater growth of CEA10 and a ~1 day delay in Af293 growth (Fig 8E).",

In a CEA10 infection, both a pyrG+ strain and pyrG- strain had significant levels of killing by 3 dpi and CFU counts from larvae infected with these strains were virtually identical 5 dpi (Fig 9C).

In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10 pyrG+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (Fig 9D). However, a CEA10 pyrG- infection is cleared significantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference in pyrG- fungal clearance between irf8-/- macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate that pyrG-deficient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing of A. fumigatus, and explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune cells than a slower-growing strain (Fig 10).",

Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of A. fumigatus are cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in the host for >5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages, but the role of macrophages in vivo in A. fumigatus pathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-mediated killing (Fig 10).",

Our data suggest that the protective niche function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (Fig 10).

In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1α production. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our experiments with myd88-/- larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to recruit neutrophils, and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils.

In fact, we find that a slower-germinating Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-germinating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killing in vitro, and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much more effective killers against hyphae than conidia. One immune mechanism that neutrophils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae. In the absence of macrophages and the increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel suggesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal.",

In a less immunosuppressed triamcinolone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent. However, this increase in virulence is thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model, while we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine studies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with increased tissue damage, but have also found that increased growth in vitro across multiple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcinolone-treated mouse model, possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms.",

CEA10-derived strains can germinate quickly in vivo, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar to one proposed for a different Aspergillus species, A. terreus, and for the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction underlying Aspergillus pathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simultaneously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-Aspergillus treatments. Are there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allow Aspergillus spores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macrophage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved.",

Injected concentrations of morpholinos were 0.4 mM (irf8 (ZFIN MO1: aatgtttcgcttactttgaaaatgg)), 0.5 mM (pu.1 (ZFIN MO1: gatatactgatactccattggtggt)), and 0.33 mM (myd88 (ZFIN MO2: gttaaacactgaccctgtggatcat)). These injected amounts of irf8 and pu.1 MO are standard and efficacy of knockdown was previously confirmed. To confirm the splice-blocking effect of the myd88 morpholino at this concentration, RNA was isolated from individual larvae with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III RT and oligo-dT (Invitrogen). PCR was then performed with GoTaq (Promega) and primers for myd88 (F: 5’-atggcatcaaagttaagtatagacc-3’, R: 5’-agggcagtgagagtgctttg-3’) and ef1a (F: 5’-tgccttcgtcccaatttcag-3’, R: 5’-taccctccttgcgctcaatc-3’). Shifts in band size were evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis. For irf8 and myd88 MO injections, a standard control MO (GeneTools) was used at a matching concentration.",

For pyrG1 auxotrophs, 5.2 mM uridine and 5 mM uracil were added to GMM as supplements. Micro-injection of spore preparations into the hindbrain of 2 dpf larvae was performed as previously described. We aimed for an infectious dose of ~30 spores per larvae. Actual spore injection doses were monitored by single larvae CFU platings on day 0 of infection as described below and are reported in figure legends for each experiment. Spores were heat-killed by incubation at 99°C for 30 min, with 300 rpm shaking. For survival and CFU experiments, individual larvae were maintained in 96-well plates.

Displayed images of Alexa-Fluor labeled spores were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. To quantify GFP signal from the NF-κB RE:GFP zebrafish line (Fig 2A and 2B), a single slice from each z-stack representing the center of the hindbrain was isolated. In Fiji, the hindbrain region was manually identified in the corresponding brightfield image and the mean grey value as well as the integrated density (area × mean grey value) in that region in the GFP channel was measured. Displayed images of GFP signal were also processed in Fiji with bilinear interpolation to increase the pixel density two-fold. Signal intensity is displayed with the 16 colors look up table. To quantify phagocyte recruitment and fungal growth (Figs 4, 7 and 8), z-stacks and/or maximum intensity projections were analyzed in Fiji. Cell numbers, phagocyte cluster area, and presence of germination and/or invasive hyphae were scored manually. 2D fungal area was calculated by thresholding.

For larval survival data and analysis of cumulative germination and invasive hyphal occurrence in larvae, replicates were pooled and analysed by Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, with experimental replicate included as a group variable. In addition to pair-wise P values, this analysis also calculates hazard ratios, which are sometimes displayed. The hazard ratio can be interpreted as the relative death rate and represents the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. For quantification of imaging experiments (spore killing, intensity, cell counts, cluster area, or fungal area) and for CFU quantification, pooled data from three replicates was compared between experimental conditions using analysis of variance. Results are summarized in terms of least-squared adjusted means (lsmeans) and standard error (SEM). In some cases, graphs show both calculated lsmeans ± SEM and individual data points, color-coded by replicate. For data in Fig 7B and 7D, representing percent of larvae per experiment over three experiments, P values were calculated by t test and regular means ± SEM are displayed. Statistical analyses and graphical representations were done in R version 3.4, GraphPad Prism version 6, and/or Microsoft Excel 2016.",
