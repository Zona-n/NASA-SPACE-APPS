Our goal was to select an appropriate concentration of epinephrine, while ensuring the safety of patients’ hemodynamic changes, and a clear surgical field can be obtained.",

Compared with each baseline value, the 1:5000 group brought more significant hemodynamic changes at the most of points of time. After 30 minutes of injection, almost all values of HR, MAP, SBP, and DBP in the relatively-lower concentration groups (1:20,000 and 1:40,000) were able to return to baseline levels, while the higher ones (1:5000 and 1:10,000) remained elevated (Table 2, Figure 2).

Brackmann et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:40,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine, and using 1:60,000 solution when over 65 years old.   Mario Sanna et al recommended injecting epinephrine 1:10,000 with infiltration of 1% lidocaine to achieve hemostatic effects.   Marna A. List’s research suggests that local injection of epinephrine at concentrations of 1:1000 and 1:10,000 during tympanoplasty can produce equivalent hemostatic effect and ensure safety.   However, there is currently no clear guidelines on how to choose the concentration of epinephrine. We believe that an appropriate concentration can maintain patients’ hemodynamic changes within normal ranges, at the same time making the surgical field clear under otoendoscope.",

Evaluate the impact of different concentrations on surgical field clarity through 2 parameters: surgical field clarity grade and tympanic membrane flap flipping time.

Our study showed that at 1 minute after injection, the HR- and BP-related parameters (HR, MAP, SBP, DBP) of the 4 groups almost all increased compared with the baseline value, especially in the 1:5000 group, whose related data had very significant statistical differences. In the group with relatively-high epinephrine/physiological concentrations (1:5000 and 1:10,000), this hemodynamic change continued until 30 minutes after injection, while in the group with relatively-low concentrations (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), the data at 30 minutes after injection showed that the patients’ HR and BP returned to baseline values. It is worth noting that, except for the patients in the 1:5000 concentration group, the curve of HR- and BP-related indicators of the patient presented a double-wave peak shape, showing an upward trend immediately after epinephrine injection, falling back 5 minutes after injection, then rising again, and then slowly falling back to baseline. We believe that the appearance of the first peak originated from α, β adrenergic receptor activation of epinephrine. With the metabolism of the drug, the curve entered its first trough, which triggered a protective mechanism in the body that caused HR and BP to rise again, and gradually returned to baseline as the drug further metabolized. In addition, our data showed that although epinephrine injection occasionally caused significant changes in patients’ ST, its impact on ST was not considered as its dynamic changes were all within the normal range. So, there is not enough evidence in this study to suggest that epinephrine injection may lead to myocardial ischemia.",
