Although structural and mechanical changes to tendon and bone following paralysis and disuse are well understood, there is a pressing need to understand how this unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis); the location most prone to tears and injury. We therefore elucidated these effects of unloading in the entheses of adult mice shoulders that were paralyzed for 21 days by treatment with botulinum toxin A. Unloading significantly increased the extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. At the millimeter scale, unloading caused bone loss. At the micrometer scale, unloading decreased bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment in the enthesis. At the nanometer scale, unloading induced compositional changes that stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite tissue. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these factors combined to increase local elevations of stress while decreasing the ability of the tissue to absorb energy prior to failure, thereby increasing injury risk. These first observations of the multiscale effects of unloading on the adult enthesis provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with increased resistance to failure.",

            "text": "The musculoskeletal system is sensitive to its loading environment. Mechanical forces are necessary to maintain tissue structure and composition capable of bearing loads. Loss of these forces due to disuse, paralysis, or microgravity leads to significant functional deficit in these tissues. For example, bone unloading results in rapid resorption and loss of mass, leading to decreased mechanical properties. Likewise, unloading of tendon results in decreased collagen production, stiffness, and strength. Tendon near myotendinous junction is affected in response to muscle unloading. However, little is known about how protracted unloading affects the site of load transfer between bone and tendon and the most common site of rotator cuff tears, the enthesis. Previous work has demonstrated that muscle loading is necessary for the fetal and postnatal development of the enthesis and can affect the healing of injuries to the enthesis. However, the effects of unloading on the homeostasis of the mature enthesis is not understood.",

            "text": "The healthy enthesis is a hierarchical composite structure optimized to efficiently transfer loads from tendon to bone to produce joint motion. At the millimeter length scale, tendon attaches to bone with a splayed morphology over a large surface area to minimize stresses. At the micrometer length scale, mineralized and unmineralized fibrocartilage interdigitate, providing a mechanism to increase the toughness of the attachment. In addition to interdigitations, gradients in mineral content, collagen orientation, and extracellular matrix composition exist across the interface to minimize stress singularities. The width of the mineral gradient, however, does not vary with muscle force, as local stresses are invariant between species and during growth. At the nanometer length scale, prior studies of the mineral gradient suggest that crystal organization and its location relative to the collagen fibrils are different in regions of high mineralization compared to regions of low mineralization. Protracted unloading has been shown to change the composition and crystallinity of the mineral crystals within the gradient of developing entheses. These changes in the structure and organization of bioapatite crystals at the enthesis in healthy and unloaded tissues can have significant effects on the tendon-to-bone attachment mechanics. However, it is not known how mineral crystal composition and organization change as a function of loading. As hierarchical structures across multiple length scales participate in load transfer at the enthesis, it is important to establish which of these are compromised as a result of unloading. This understanding will allow for the development of focused and relevant therapeutic approaches.",

A paperclip embedded in additional epoxy was placed over the articular surface of the humeral head to minimize the risk of fracture of the growth plate. Immediately before tensile testing, the tendons were cleaned of all attached muscle by gentle scraping and secured between two layers of thin paper with a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive before being mounted in the top clamp grip of custom aluminum grips. The potted bone, while hanging from the gripped tendon was lowered into the bottom grip consisting of a hollow mount with three radially placed screws.

Choosing a cross-sectional area for normalization is a difficult challenge in complex systems like the tendon-bone unit. For that reason we measured 3 cross-sectional areas for all samples: the tendon minimum cross-sectional area, the footprint area, and the failure area as discussed in Section 2.3.1. Historically, the minimum tendon cross-sectional area has been used in calculating material properties for these samples. We used it here in the measure of elastic properties to provide comparison with the literature; however, when it came to the failure properties it seemed unreasonable to use this value, as the entire tendon clearly does not participate in the failure. Visual inspection after failure showed that the tendon was surrounded by an exterior sheath, which remained intact even after bony avulsion at the enthesis. This structure was included in the cross-sectional area evaluation, but not in the mechanics. This spatial relation was similarly true of the footprint area, which remained mostly undamaged during failure. Instead, we felt that it was most accurate to use an area that is known to participate fully in the failure. Any cross-sectional area chosen would have been imperfect, but we determined that this was the most accurate measurement.",

Maximum force, stiffness, strength (i.e., maximum stress), toughness, and energy-to-yield were determined from the stress-strain curves of each load-to-failure test. The energy-to-yield was defined as the total area under the stress–strain plot beginning from the point at which the tendon reached a load of 0.05 N and continuing until the yield stress was attained. The yield stress was defined as the stress value when the tangent modulus decreased to 50% of the maximum value in the load-to-failure tests. Note that yield is poorly defined in biological materials in general, and that the yield point noted by this criterion likely does not, as in metals, indicate a threshold at which inelastic deformation begins to take place. The toughness was defined as the total area under the stress–strain curve beginning at 0.05 N and continuing until this baseline value of stress was again attained. The strength was defined as the peak values on the stress–strain curves. Samples that failed either at the grip or the growth plate were excluded from analysis (exclusions: 2 Botox, 4 Saline).

Relative positions of the detectors allowed for simultaneous acquisition of STEM high-angle annular darkfield (HAADF) images along with STEM-EELS. Bone-tendon interfaces were located using conventional TEM bright-field (BF) imaging. Each interface was then imaged using STEM-HAADF/BF, and multiple images were stitched together to produce a montage image of the entire interface. From that image, typically four ROIs for each interface were selected for STEM-HAADF/EELS spectral imaging. Only ROIs that overhung holes in the amorphous-C support film that coated the TEM grids were examined to avoid C edge signal from the support film. The STEM-EELS spectral images were obtained by collecting an EELS spectrum at each pixel within a ROI area. The areas of the ROIs ranged from 13.6×104 to 21.9×104 in total pixels (spatial resolutions between 3.0 – 5.7 nm/pixel). Each core-loss spectrum was collected with an energy dispersion of 0.3 eV/channel over the energy range 200 – 814.4 eV (2048 channels per spectrum). Raster dwell times were 2.5 s per pixel, corresponding to total acquisition times from 9.5 to 15.25 hrs per spectral image.

Previous studies demonstrated that muscle loading was necessary for enthesis development. Numerous studies have shown that unloading can lead to decreased stiffness in knees and achilles tendons. In many cases, the decrease in stiffness is correlated to a decrease in tendon cross-sectional area. However, there are also reports that suggests that 2–3 weeks of unloading has no effect on the stiffness but does result in a decrease in tendon CSA. In the current study, we see change in neither the stiffness of the complex nor the tendon CSA nor footprint area. Furthermore, the elastic properties of the supraspinatus-humerus complex remained unchanged with unloading as did the macro-structure of the tendon. This suggests that the tendon structure remains relatively unchanged after 3 weeks of unloading resulting in a constant stiffness of the supraspinatus-humerus complex irrespective of the loading condition. However, we show that muscle unloading of the tendon enthesis for only 21 days resulted in compromised failure properties, including decreasing trends in strength and decreasing toughness of the attachment. These results point to tendon-mediated elastic properties of the complex, whereas mineralized regions of the tissue control the failure properties.",

            "text": "Unloading also led to increases in the extent of tissue damage. All the entheses, irrespective of their loading environment prior to testing, failed by avulsion of mineralized tissue from the attachment site (Fig 1G). Clinically, most rotator cuff injuries exhibit tears at the insertion site or within the tendon, especially in non-acute tears and in the elderly population. However, a small proportion of rotator cuff injuries present as bony avulsions of the supraspinatus or bony partial articular surface tendon avulsion lesions. These clinical cases often present with fractures of the greater tuberosity and supraspinatus tears, where the avulsed bone remains strongly attached to the tendon fibers. The fact that greater tuberosity fractures, compared to other proximal humeral fractures, tend to affect younger individuals and that multiple clinical reports of these injuries seem to occur in individuals younger than 25 years old have led to speculation that bony avulsions are more likely to occur in young patients. However, bony injuries have also been reported in more aged individuals. Bhatia et al. suggest that, instead of being directly affected by age, these injuries are most likely to occur in individuals that exhibit healthy tendon-to-bone attachments. This is in agreement with the fact that bony avulsions have been reported to occur after traumatic injuries and not due to chronic degradation. The mice in this study were healthy adults with no genetic predisposition to rotator cuff degeneration; thus, they are expected to have healthy tendon-to-bone attachment sites. Although unloading had effects on the tissue at the failure site, these effects were not sufficient to change the mode of failure. The failure mechanism we observed has also been previously reported for healthy supraspinatus-to-humeral head attachments under a variety of loading conditions in other animal models. Although the failure mechanism was the same for all samples, the failure area was increased in the unloading group. This suggests that the mature enthesis is sensitive to loading and would be at risk for more extensive injury after even short durations of unloading. The increase in extent of failure may be a consequence of structural changes at several hierarchical scales.",

            "text": "At the millimeter length scale, changes in the bone architecture due to unloading can have significant mechanical consequences. It is well established that unloading results in bone loss. In the current study, as well as other examples of unloading, the bone loss occurred primarily in the region directly adjacent to the unloaded enthesis and lead to increased risk of avulsion failure. This loss of supporting trabecular bone was dramatic, with a nearly 40% decrease in BV/TV and a 14% increase in trabecular spacing (Fig 2A,C). To determine the possible mechanical consequences of this bone loss, a plate-in-bending model was developed. In this model, we consider the mineralized fibrocartilage to be a circular plate that is clamped at its edges by the trabeculae. The maximum deflection of the plate, ωmax, is given by  where q is the applied pressure, D is the flexural rigidity, and a is distance between clamps. In that the trabecular spacing increases with paralysis, as seen from μCT analysis, the distance between clamps will increase, resulting in an increase in deflection proportional to the 4th power. A 14% increase in trabecular spacing, from 0.14 to 0.16 mm as measured here, will thus result in a 70% increase in deflection. This increases the energy stored in the circular plate, and hence increases the energy available to fracture the circumference of the avulsed trabecular bone. In addition, stress concentrations that develop at the trabecular subchondral-bone junction clamping sites can induce failure at those locations. Increasing distance between trabeculae therefore will result in larger failure areas. These results agree with the experimentally observed avulsion of mineralized fibrocartilage as well as the increased failure area in botox samples (Fig 1G-H). Loss of the supporting trabecular bone may therefore increase the risk and extent of failure at the enthesis by compromising the underlying bony support structure.",

Furthermore, the orientation of the crystals was also modified with unloading.

However, unloading resulted in a significant increase in the misalignment of the crystals relative to the long axis of the tendon.

            "text": "To clarify the role that changes in crystal size and orientation may have on enthesis mechanics, a rotation model was analyzed. Motion of mineral relative to collagen fibers requires work and can serve as a means of mechanical energy absorption. It has previously been shown that, even in densely mineralized tissues such as bone, mineral crystals rotate within the tissue during loading. This rotation may be in part responsible for the presence of a region of increased compliance previously measured within the mineral gradient zone. The compliant zone can undergo significant deformation during loading, allowing it to absorb and dissipate mechanical energy and thus avoid catastrophic failure. Therefore, modifications to this compliant zone, such as the decreased mineral size and alignment in the unloaded group, may decrease the toughness of the enthesis and increase the extent of failure. To estimate the change between the botox and control samples in energy dissipation due to crystal rotation and sliding in the collagen matrix, an analytical model was developed (Supplementary Document). The model considers a crystal of length Lo and width w sitting in a collagen matrix at an angle θo from the direction of collagen fiber alignment (Fig 5A). A load, σ, is applied to the system along the direction of collagen alignment, causing a deformation with a stretch ratio λ. The amount of energy dissipated from the rotation and sliding of the crystal can then be calculated from the equation:  where α is related to the displacement of a point on a crystal relative to the collagen beneath it, and τ is a friction factor between the collagen and mineral. The energy dissipation varies as a function of the original orientation of the crystal, with crystals aligned parallel and perpendicular to the fibrils resulting in the highest dissipation (Fig 5B). Assuming a von Mises distribution for θo, an orientation distribution was calculated from the measured FWHM. The total normalized energy dissipation, Wtot, could then be calculated by integrating W(θo,λ) over the orientation distribution. Although the botox and control samples both exhibited an increase in Wtot with increasing distance from the unmineralized edge, unloading resulted in an overall decrease in the Wtot (Fig 5C). A decreased Wtot suggests that, for the rotation mode, energy absorption could be deficient after unloading.",

Previous work has shown that the mineral shifts from being uniquely extrafibrillar in regions of low mineralization to being both intra- and extrafibrillar in regions of high mineralization. To examine if changes in nanometer organization of the crystals might explain the micrometer changes in orientation and size, STEM-EELS spectral imaging was performed across loaded and unloaded entheses. In these composition maps, the mineral appears to transition from extrafibrillar to extrafibrillar/intrafibrillar with increasing mineral content across both the loaded and unloaded entheses (Fig 4). Since extrafibrillar mineral is not constrained within the restrictive volume of the gap zones of the collagen fibrils as is intrafibrillar mineral, the former has a greater range in its possible alignment relative to the fibrils, resulting in a more disordered system. Conversely, as intrafibrillar mineralization increases, mineral crystals become more constrained within the aligned collagen network and thus, on average, the crystals become more aligned. However, because extrafibrillar mineral obscures intrafibrillar mineral in thin TEM sections, we were not able to determine if the transition between extra- and intra-fibrillar mineral was modified in unloaded samples compared to control samples.",

            "text": "At the atomic scale, the composition of the mineral was altered with unloading; this would undoubtedly alter its physical properties and could contribute to mechanical changes at higher length scales. Specifically, the carbonate levels measured in the botox treated samples were significantly decreased compared to the saline controls (Supplementary Figure S1). Bone mineral, although often described as hydroxylapatite, is a highly substituted calcium apatite containing 2–8% carbonate. Even a small decrease in carbonate substitution can dramatically increase the modulus of bone mineral. Since the enthesis is a composite of mineral and collagen, an increase in the mineral stiffness will in turn increase the stiffness of the gradient region. An increase in the stiffness of a previously compliant zone could subsequently decrease the attachment’s ability to dissipate energy and thereby increase failure risk and extent.",

            "text": "The musculoskeletal system dynamically responds to its loading environment to guide its development and maintain its structure. To develop targeted therapeutics to treat the effects of unloading (e.g., paralysis or microgravity), it is necessary to determine which features in the complex structural hierarchy of the enthesis are affected by unloading, and how those affected features may influence the mechanical response of the system. Botox was used as a local paralytic to unload the shoulders of adult mice. We found that even a short duration of unloading significantly increased extent of failure of the enthesis, possibly due to structural changes across hierarchical scales (Fig. 6). At the millimeter scale, trabecular bone volume in the humeral head was significantly decreased, which could lead to increased bending of the subchondral bone and subsequently increased failure area (Fig 6 middle). At the micrometer scale, unloading led to decreases in crystal size and alignment (Fig 6 right). These changes can result in decreased energy absorption in the compliant zone, thus possibly increasing the risk and extent of failure. At the atomic scale, mineral carbonate content was decreased with protracted unloading. This change in composition has been shown to increase the stiffness of the crystals and thus the overall composite. A stiffer composite is less able to dissipate mechanical energy, thereby possibly increasing failure risk. Hierarchical changes at a variety of scales can affect the overall mechanical properties of the enthesis. Therefore, it is important to consider structures at a variety of scales when developing treatments.",

However, it decreased certain failure properties, including strength (D) and toughness (E). The minimum cross-sectional area of the tendon (C) and the footprint area of the tendon attachment (F) were unaffected by unloading. In all cases, the failure mechanism was avulsion of mineralized tissue at the attachment site, as shown in μCT images for saline and botox samples (G). The failure area, defined here as the area of the resultant crater after avulsion, was significantly larger for unloaded entheses (H).

In addition, the crystal size increased with mineralization (B). Unloading significantly affected both measurements, with botox treatment decreasing alignment and crystal size. In both the control and botox samples, the residual strain (C) and strain distribution (D) decrease rapidly within the first 4 μm of the enthesis, followed by a plateau. This suggests that in an ~4 μm area, there is a change in the mechanical environment that results in a more homogeneous compressive residual strain.",

As mineralization increased, the mineral became intrafibrillar, as shown by the banding pattern in the calcium images at the end of the gradient.

Although changes to tendon and bone following paralysis are understood, there is a pressing need to clarify how unloading affects the bone-tendon interface (enthesis), which is the location most prone to tears and injury. We elucidated the effects of enthesis unloading in adult mice shoulders showing, for the first time, that unloading significantly increased the risk and extent of mechanical failure and was associated with structural changes across hierarchical scales. These observations provide new insight into the hierarchical features of structure and composition that endow the enthesis with resilience. This knowledge can be used to develop more targeted treatments to improve mobility and function.",
