As a result, five isolates belonging to the Enterobacter bugandensis group of bacteria from two different locations of the ISS were isolated. Since the initial molecular screening identified these strains as Enterobacter but the identification was not able to resolve their taxonomy to species level, detailed genomic characterizations were warranted in addition to the traditional microbiological characterization. Due to its unstable taxonomic structure, methods utilized for the speciation of Enterobacter varied widely. Commercial biochemical typing systems such as API® 20E or Vitek® 2, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) methods have been used, but with limited success. On the basis of 16S rRNA analysis, Enterobacter was structured as a polyphyletic genus and most of the species could not be resolved. Therefore, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis was found to be more appropriate for phylogenetic classification of Enterobacter species.",

In general, no noticeable phenotypic differences were observed among the Enterobacter species tested including E. bugandensis EB-247T, whose genome is closer to ISS strains. As reported earlier, all these five ISS Enterobacter isolates were resistant to cefazolin, cefoxitin, oxacillin, penicillin and rifampin, while for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin, strains were either resistant or intermediate resistant.

To test antimicrobial resistance at genomic level, the ISS strains were further compared with nosocomial isolates (1291 genomes) having more than 95% ANI identity with the ISS strains, which taxonomically identified them as same species.

The remaining 21 rings indicate the presence or absence of BLASTN hits at that position. Each ring represents WGS of single Enterobacter species, each shown in different color. Positions covered by BLASTN alignments are indicated in solid colors and gaps (white spaces) represent genomic regions not covered by BLASTN alignments. Order of genome from inner ring to outer is as follow: E. aerogenes KCTC 2190, E. asburiae ATCC 35953 T, E. bugandensis EB-247T, E. cancerogenus ATCC 35316, E. bugandensis 153_ECLO, E. cloacae ATCC 13047T, E. bugandensis MBRL1077, E. hormaechei ATCC 49162T, E. kobei DSM 13645T, E. lignolyticus SCF1, E. ludwigii EN-119T, E. massiliensis JC163T, E. mori LMG 25706T, E. muelleri JM-458T, Enterobacter soli ATCC BAA-2102T, Enterobacter xiangfangensis LMG 27195T, E. bugandensis IF2SW-B1, E. bugandensis IF2SW-B5, E. bugandensis IF2SW-P2, E. bugandensis IF2SW-P3, E. bugandensis IF3SW-P2, Xenorhabdus nematophila ATCC 19061T",

Visualizing a prokaryote genome as a circular image has become a powerful means of displaying informative comparisons of one genome to a number of others. Using BRIG, a global visual comparison of ISS isolates with other Enterobacter WGS from the GenBank Microbial Genomes Resource was carried out. The resulting output of the BRIG analysis, a visualization image, showed draft genome assembly information, read coverage, assembly breakpoints, and collapsed repeats. The mapping of unassembled sequencing reads of the ISS genomes against fully annotated E. cloacae central reference sequences is depicted in Fig. 4.",

Additional genomic analyses revealed a close genetic relatedness between ISS isolates and nosocomial earth isolates. MLST and whole genome SNP tree placed ISS and nosocomial isolates to a separate clade when phylogenetically aligned with other member of genus Enterobacter. A detailed functional and antimicrobial resistance analysis reveals that the ISS isolates have a 79% probability of being a human pathogen and share similar antimicrobial resistance pattern with E. bugandensis EB-247, MBRL-1077 and 153_ECLO strains, making them relevant for future missions and crew health considerations.",

Genes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds, including the multidrug resistance tripartite system (also known as 3-protein systems) as shown in a polychlorinated biphenyl-degrader, Burkholderia xenovorans LB400, was noticed in the ISS strain. This protein forms the basic structure and plays a crucial role in, the functioning of an efflux pump rendering a microbe drug resistant. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) locus or MAR operon was observed in ISS strains, which codes for protein MarA, MarB, MarC, and MarR, and regulate more than 60 genes, including upregulation of drug efflux systems that have been reported in Escherichia coli K12. Aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, whose role is spectinomycin 9-O-adenylyltransferases, which confers microbial resistance to the aminoglycosides in Salmonella enterica, was also seen in ISS strains. Similarly, resistance to fluoroquinolones due to a mutation in gyrA gene in S. enterica, and fosfomycin resistance due to the presence of FosA protein-coding gene, which catalyzes the addition of glutathione to C1 of the oxirane in Serratia marcescens, were observed in ISS strains. Multiple copies of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes highly homologous to S. marcescens, a pathogen, were identified in the ISS Enterobacter genomes, which gives an indication that these strains may be a potential human pathogen. When tested with PathogenFinder algorithm, strain IF2SW-P2T had > 77% probability to be a human pathogen. When compared with E. cloacae ATCC 13047, which is a well-described human pathogen, all five ISS strains showed a > 79% probability score.",

Fluoroquinolone resistance due to gyrase and topoisomerase mutation was present in all the strains. Metal-dependent hydrolases, cation efflux system protein CusA, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein, cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance protein CzcA, DNA-binding heavy metal response regulator, Co/Zn/Cd efflux system membrane fusion protein, zinc transporter ZitB were found in both ISS isolate and nosocomial organism understudy. These genes principally help in detoxification of periplasm by exporting toxic metal cation outside the cell. Determinants of the metal resistance are usually located on the plasmid and readily acquired from the environment and also complement antibiotic resistance. The plasmid encoded putative transcriptional regulators containing the CopG/Arc/MetJ DNA-binding domain and a metal-binding domain were present in the ISS strains (Additional file 2: Table S2). Further studies are required for phenotypic characterization to confirm this trait. Presence of active beta lactamase gene, efflux pump, and RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division protein family) protein family renders broad-spectrum resistance to ISS isolates from drugs and natural inhibitors.",

Antimicrobial and metal resistance is also conferred by RND genes, which were present in all the strains under study. Genomic analysis reveals the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria. RND efflux system, inner membrane transporter CmeB, membrane fusion protein CmeA, outer membrane lipoprotein CmeC, outer membrane lipoprotein NodT family were found in all strains. These become important for the future space studies, as MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to the substances like bile, hormone and host defense molecule, which can make bacteria a dominant persistor and lead to pathogenicity in humans.",

However, the pathogenicity of the ISS strains compared to clinical strains isolated from patients should be explored in vivo experiments before making any assumption about whether these potential AMR gene markers are due to spaceflight changes or not. Moreover, the transit time and route for the organisms from the ISS may have some small impact on the response or physiological traits of the bacteria. WGS is still an important tool to monitor transmission routes of opportunistic pathogen bacteria. To avoid this, future missions could utilize Nanopore sequencing directly in microgravity as well as additional function and taxonomic classification methods, and then leverage the above detailed analytic steps to gauge relevance for crew health and safety.",
