            "text": "Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of space-flown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA’s ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak.",

            "text": "Exposure to microgravity, and subsequent muscle unloading, is known to cause extensive muscle weakness and atrophy, especially to postural muscles such as the soleus. Recent work has demonstrated that muscle weakness precedes muscle atrophy and was thought to be due, at least in part, to Ca2+ dysregulation. Using soleus muscle samples from the rodent research (RR) -1 and -9 missions, we demonstrated the Ca2+ uptake ability of the sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump to be severely impaired following ~1 month of spaceflight. In muscle, SERCA is responsible for maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) by bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Impaired SERCA function can result in high [Ca2+]i, leading to elevated RONS, increased protein degradation, cell death, and muscle weakness and atrophy. Structurally, SERCA pumps are highly susceptible to post-translational modifications (e.g., tyrosine nitration, cysteine nitrosylation) from elevated RONS that will impair its catalytic activity . The ensuing elevated [Ca2+]i will not only lead to muscle damage but can also further increase RONS production creating a negative cyclic relationship that perpetuates muscle pathology.",

            "text": "While damaging at high concentrations, RONS are important signaling molecules at low concentrations. Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are a family of enzymes that maintain physiological RONS concentrations by scavenging and neutralizing highly reactive superoxide molecules (for review, see ref. ). Mice deficient of SOD show impaired SERCA activity, muscle weakness, and atrophy; but, the pharmacological activation of SERCA can reduce mitochondrial RONS production and attenuate muscle atrophy despite increased oxidative stress. Thus, targeting SERCA, either through genetic overexpression or pharmacological intervention, may be a viable target to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with Manganese(III) meso-tetrakis(N-n-butoxyethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ (BuOE, also seen as BMX-001), an antioxidant that acts as a SOD mimetic, could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction in the murine soleus muscle following 35 days of spaceflight. BuOE has been effective in reducing oxidative stress in various animal models of radiation-induced injury, a relevant injury mechanism to spaceflight, providing strong rationale for the investigation of its effectiveness in the present study.",

While BuOE treatment increased SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+ in both the GC/VIV and flight groups, it was unable to rescue the significant increases in 4-HNE content or SR Ca2+ leak, measured using an ionophore ratio, induced by microgravity exposure. Consistent with previous work, we observed increases in protein content of both SERCA isoforms following spaceflight as well as increases in oxidative stress and dynamic changes in the expression of the three SERCA regulators, SLN, NNAT, and PLN.

            "text": "Past literature using both ground-based and spaceflight models in rodents and humans has begun to suggest that Ca2+ dysregulation in skeletal muscle may be an early step in the pathogenesis of weakness and atrophy. Specifically, we have previously shown the Ca2+ uptake ability of SERCA to be impaired following spaceflight which we attributed, at least partially, to increases in total protein RONS. SERCA pumps have highly susceptible tyrosine residues that, in the presence of increased RONS, can result in tyrosine nitration. Tyrosine 294 and 295 of SERCA appear to be most vulnerable to tyrosine nitration and reside in the transmembrane domain of the pump, a necessary domain for Ca2+ translocation. The structural changes that ensue following tyrosine nitration of these residues result in impaired catalytic activity and increased [Ca2+]i. Here, we investigated ATPase activity of the SERCA pump and found no changes in response to microgravity; though, we do observe a main effect of BuOE treatment increasing SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. This is consistent with our previous work showing that heterozygous deletion of SOD2 reduces SERCA’s affinity for Ca2+. The increases in both SERCA isoforms with spaceflight are consistent with our previous work and were similarly unable to attenuate spaceflight-induced increases in [Ca2+]i. Given that SERCA density is the primary determinant of Ca2+ uptake the increased protein content should increase SERCA catalytic activity; however, this was not detected, suggesting protein dysfunction or a failed compensatory response. The mechanism underlying increased SERCA protein expression following spaceflight requires further investigation but has been observed in other muscle-wasting diseases and myopathies. SLN and PLN act to reduce SERCA-mediated Ca2+ uptake through reductions in affinity as well as inducing Ca2+ slippage; however, no effects of BuOE were detected on the protein expression of SLN, NNAT, or PLN with the only changes being observed with spaceflight. With regards to the SERCA regulators, inconsistencies were observed with the previous RR-9 mission where there was a clear increase in SLN and decrease in NNAT following spaceflight; but, RR-18 shows the opposite with reductions in SLN and increases in NNAT, which is maintained even when loaded on the same gel (Supplemental Fig. 1A, B). At present, we can only speculate that possible differences in reloading time (~20 h for RR-18 and ~38 h for RR-9) would lead to altered expression patterns, but this warrants further investigation.",

Increased SR Ca2+ leak has been observed in various muscle pathologies, many of which are related to post-translational modifications of RYR and its regulators. Here, we observed increases in phosphorylated RYR, albeit non-statistically significant, that may still be contributing to increased Ca2+ leak. Notably, previous work has demonstrated that blocking L-type Ca2+ channels attenuates unloading-induced Ca2+ overload in the rat soleus. In addition to alterations to RYR, the lipid composition of the SR membrane can also drastically alter Ca2+ handling. More specifically, it has been shown that increased lipid peroxidation will increase membrane permeability and with significant increases in 4-HNE, a product of lipid peroxidation, in the space-flown soleus, it is likely that alterations to SR permeability are contributing to increased Ca2+ leak, though more targeted studies are required. As well as SR Ca2+ leak, there are several other mechanisms that can lead to elevations in [Ca2+]i that were not explored in the present study. One such mechanism is early muscle membrane depolarization, due to reduced Na+/K+-ATPase pump activity, possibly triggering the opening of the voltage-sensitive dihydropyridine receptors and increasing [Ca2+]i. Ca2+ overload may also be a product of store-operated Ca2+ entry - the process of Ca2+ influx triggered by reductions in SR luminal [Ca2+] (for review, see ref. ), which could be triggered by SERCA dysfunction. This phenomenon has been identified to contribute to Ca2+ overload in dystrophic muscle and various other myopathies, though its contributions to muscle atrophy and weakness following unloading remain to be explored.",

Future studies focused on skeletal muscle, namely SERCA function in the soleus, may benefit from higher doses of BuOE treatment or other modes of cytotoxic protection. For example, HSP70 can protect SERCA from oxidant damage in conditions of muscular dystrophy, and it would be of interest to determine whether pharmacological induction or genetic overexpression of HSP70 could protect SERCA function in the context of spaceflight. While we were limited in our ability to measure the sources of RONS in this study, previous work has demonstrated mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased NADPH oxidase expression and activity to contribute to RONS production with spaceflight and simulated microgravity exposure. Further investigation into whether targeting RONS production at the source can counteract muscle weakness and atrophy is needed. Regardless, targeting Ca2+ leak from the SR has shown to be beneficial to muscle health in aged mice, hypoxia-induced atrophy in rodents, and murine dystrophic muscle indicating that this may be a viable target for spaceflight-induced changes in SR permeability and leak. Importantly, a recent study by Sharlo, et al.  treated rats with the SERCA activator, CDN1163, during hindlimb suspension (NASA’s simulated model of microgravity) and, while they didn’t measure SERCA function directly, they found improvements in several muscle parameters including soleus fatigue resistance, mitochondrial markers, and markers of Ca2+ homeostasis. This finding, along with others targeting SERCA activation in situations of muscle impairment demonstrate the importance of directly targeting SERCA in space.",

SLN expression has been shown to upregulated in several muscle-wasting conditions, but whether this upregulation is beneficial or detrimental to muscle is still under debate (for review, see ref. ). Procedurally, the RR-1, RR-9, and RR-18 studies all maintained mouse strain and housing temperature but disparities in reloading time prior to euthanasia (RR-9, ~38 h; RR-18, ~20 h) may contribute to the differences in SLN expression between missions. This hypothesis remains speculative but would be an interesting avenue of investigation in the future. Finally, due to limitations on the amount of sample, we were unable to investigate SERCA-specific analysis of RONS modifications which could provide insight into the changes in Ca2+ affinity observed here.",
