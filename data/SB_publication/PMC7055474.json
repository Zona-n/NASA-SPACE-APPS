            "text": "Renewable fuels hold great promise for the future yet their susceptibility to biodegradation and subsequent corrosion represents a challenge that needs to be directly assessed. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that is widely used as a substitute or extender for petroleum diesel and is composed of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters derived from plant or animal fats. Biodiesel can be blended up to 20% v/v with ultra-low sulfur diesel (i.e., B20) and used interchangeably with diesel engines and infrastructure. The addition of biodiesel, however, has been linked to increased susceptibility to biodegradation. Microorganisms proliferating via degradation of biodiesel blends have been linked to microbiologically influenced corrosion in the laboratory, but not measured directly in storage tanks (i.e., in situ). To measure in situ microbial proliferation, fuel degradation and microbially influenced corrosion, we conducted a yearlong study of B20 storage tanks in operation at two locations, identified the microorganisms associated with fuel fouling, and measured in situ corrosion. The bacterial populations were more diverse than the fungal populations, and largely unique to each location. The bacterial populations included members of the Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. The abundant Eukaryotes at both locations consisted of the same taxa, including a filamentous fungus within the family Trichocomaceae, not yet widely recognized as a contaminant of petroleum fuels, and the Saccharomycetaceae family of yeasts. Increases in the absolute and relative abundances of the Trichocomaceae were correlated with significant, visible fouling and pitting corrosion. This study identified the relationship between fouling of B20 with increased rates of corrosion and the microorganisms responsible, largely at the bottom of the sampled storage tanks. To our knowledge this is the first in situ study of this scale incorporating community and corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment.",

            "text": "The use of renewable fuels is on the rise worldwide. One renewable fuel in use broadly is biodiesel, which is composed of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) derived from plant and animal lipids. Biodiesel is commonly used as a replacement or additive to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) up to 5% v/v to restore lubricity lost due to the removal of sulfur compounds. Blends containing up to 20% v/v biodiesel (i.e., B20) can be used without changes to existing engines or infrastructure. Combustion of these blends produces reduced nitric oxide emissions, an ozone precursor of concern, than pure biodiesel fuel. The consumption of biodiesel has increased worldwide over the past 10 years because of its combustion properties, performance advantages, and increasingly strict emissions regulations.",

            "text": "The advantages offered by blending biodiesel with ULSD are potentially offset by the drawback of lower fuel stability. Biodiesel contains more dissolved oxygen than ULSD, reducing oxidative stability and increasing the risk of fuel biodegradation. Biodiesel is also more hygroscopic than ULSD, causing blends like B20 to absorb and retain more water. Water in fuel represents habitat for microorganisms and is essential for microbial metabolism and growth; water entrained within fuel enables microbiological proliferation, resulting in fouling. Liquid water is denser than fuel and will accumulate at the bottom of any storage vessel. Microorganisms at the fuel-water interface are able to live in an aqueous environment with the fuel as an oxidizable substrate and source of dissolved oxygen. Fouling (e.g., the accumulation of biomass) is greatest at the fuel-water interface and microbial metabolism quickly depletes any oxygen in the water.",

            "text": "Microbial growth and subsequent corrosion are dependent upon fuel chemistry and the amount of water present. Biodiesel and biodiesel blends do not contain free fatty acids by specification, but copious amounts of fatty acids are produced as bi-products of the metabolism of FAME by microorganisms that may result in microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of steel tanks or tank components. Polymer tank seals and fittings that are also exposed to organic acids can exhibit decreased ductility and strength. Production of CO2 during the microbial metabolism of FAME could also increase the rate of corrosion within a storage tank. General production and dissolution of acid and CO2 within a fluid can result in uniform corrosion, where the loss of material is distributed across a surface. The accumulation of biofilms results in several possible outcomes including the localized production and concentration of corrosive compounds, the formation of galvanic couples, and the ennoblement of steel surfaces. Any of these would result in localized corrosion that is characterized by deep, penetrating pits on metallic surfaces that represent a great risk to storage tank infrastructure. The link between biodegradation and corrosion has been studied in other petroleum environments such as oil production, drilling, or storage of petroleum products in marine environments including biodiesel yet no in situ study exists to this point in B20 storage and distribution systems.",

            "text": "For over a decade, the United States Air Force (USAF) has stored B20 biodiesel and used it in non-tactical support vehicles as a component of their Strategic Energy Plan. The adoption of B20 biodiesel by the USAF, however, correlated with an increase in reports of “bad fuel,” or fouling due to visible particulates in the fuel and clogged filters at dispensers. We hypothesized that the reported fouling was microbiological in origin, rather than from the abiotic production of waxes in fuel that was suspected by fuel operators and reported previously. Both fuel fouling and MIC have the potential to impact the operation of B20 biodiesel storage and distribution systems. Pure cultures and enrichments of microorganisms have shown the ability to degrade biodiesel blends (including B20) and induce corrosion under laboratory conditions but no studies link the microbial community and its proliferation with corrosion in active storage tanks over time. To this end, we conducted a rare longitudinal study, in situ, of microbial community dynamics linked to the corrosion of steel in B20 biodiesel underground storage tanks (UST). Two USAF locations housing B20 biodiesel tanks with recurrent fuel quality issues were selected for this study. We hypothesized that the reported issues were the result of microbial contamination and predicted that corrosion would be greatest in tanks with the most biomass. We subsequently conducted a 1-year survey of the microbial communities present at both storage locations to link microbiological fouling, fuel degradation, and MIC in situ within each storage tank.",

Each base had three storage tanks containing B20 biodiesel (total of 6 tanks) that were under normal operation throughout the study. The only exception was tank SE 3, which was removed from the study after 9 months due to severe microbiological contamination that required mitigation. These tanks were not on a defined cleaning schedule. Instead, they were taken offline and cleaned as fouling or contamination was detected. All tanks at SW and two tanks at SE (SE 3 and 4) were cleaned just prior to the onset of the study and insertion of corrosion or “witness” coupons. The sampled tanks had an atmospheric (i.e., oxic) headspace and no biocides were used in the fuels stored at each location. The three tanks at SW were constructed of uncoated carbon steel and installed in the early 1950s. At the SE site, two of the tanks (SE 3 and SE 4) were fiberglass and located at the same fueling station. The third tank (SE E) was made of carbon steel, lined on the outside with fiberglass, and located at another fueling station. Each of the six tanks had a large maintenance hatch (i.e., “manway”) that was used as an access point for access and fuel sampling (Supplementary Figure S1).

Upon arrival, coupons were desiccated to remove any water or fuel, weighed, and then cleaned using the ASTM standard G1-03 hydrochloric acid method. Briefly, coupons were sonicated for 10 min in soapy water, rinsed in deionized water, dried, and incubated in 3 M hydrochloric acid with 3.5 g/L hexamethylene tetramine solution for 10 min. Acid cleaned coupons were washed in deionized water, acetone, and methanol, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and weighed. Biomass at 12 months was estimated as the difference in the weight of the coupons prior to cleaning (after desiccation) and after cleaning. No obvious degradation of the polymer coating was observed visually before or after removal of the biofilm from sampled coupons.",

A subset of steel witness coupons (n = 2 per time point) was imaged by several complementary approaches: SEM, confocal microscopy, and profilometry. Coupons with intact biofilms that were intended for microscopic analysis were scored with a 2 × 14 grid to enable correlation between locations imaged prior to the removal of biomass and after imaging for pitting corrosion via profilometry (each quadrant roughly 9 × 11 mm). Select coupons were then imaged with the biofilm in place using a VHX 2000E (Keyence Corp., Itasca, IL, United States) digital microscope from 20 to 200× magnification.

Maximum pitting rates (recorded as MPY) were calculated for each sample point by the formula  to calculate the rate of corrosion in mm/year and then converted to a value of MPY by multiplying the result by 39.4 (1 mm/y = 39.4 MPY). Pits were defined as a region that was a minimum of 10 μm below the mathematically determined reference plane (surface) and at least 200 μm2 in area. A Shapiro-Wilk test of normalcy (p > 0.05) was used to determine normality of the dataset, after which a non-parametric Van der Waerden test was used to compare field coupons to sterile controls. Multiple pairwise tests comparing in situ incubations to controls were carried out post hoc using a Conover test within the package PMCMR, and p values were corrected using the false discovery rate (FDR) method within PMCMR. Correlation between the presence of biofilm and corrosion was determined using coupons scored with a diamond knife to facilitate sample orientation, which were imaged by SEM and by confocal microscopy VK-X250.",

A potentially significant disadvantage to their adoption of B20 biodiesel was an increase in reports of fuel biocontamination.

A recent EPA study reported moderate or severe corrosion in 83% of inspected storage tanks, suggesting an additional impact on fuel infrastructure could be linked to the degradation of biodiesel. Recent work has identified the metabolism of microorganisms in biodiesel blends that results in biodegradation but microbial communities in non-marine environments have not yet been directly linked to increased corrosion rates in situ. In this work, we conducted the first longitudinal study co-locating the microorganisms known to be responsible for fuel fouling, acid production, and microbially influenced corrosion on “witness” coupons installed near the bottom of tanks in situ. Our study established a link between fuel fouling and increased biofilm biomass comprised of specific fungal and bacterial taxa in operational B20 biodiesel tanks. We also linked biomass within B20 storage tanks to pitting corrosion, co-located with the microbial biofilms. The direct linkage between fuel fouling and corrosion is of considerable concern to tank operations.",

Members of the genus Byssochlamys have been linked to the contamination of acidic fruit juices and are capable of propagating across a broad range of pH and temperatures under oxic conditions. A member of the genus Byssochlamys was recently isolated from biodiesel in Hawaii, and characterized for its ability to degrade ULSD and biodiesel. Byssochlamys spores can withstand boiling (high temperatures are a part of the biodiesel production process), low concentrations of oxygen that may exist at the bottom of a fuel tank, and pH values as low as 3.5 as microbial community members begin to acidify water at the bottom of a fuel tank. Additionally, members of the anamorph of Byssochlamys, Paecilomyces, are known to ferment under anaerobic conditions, producing acetate and ethanol. Unclassified Eurotiomycetes (identified as Byssochlamys) was numerically dominant in all tanks at SW over time with much lower observable diversity than the Bacteria. The abundance of these fungi likely contributes to the increased acidity observed in tanks at SE as well as to the acidification and fouling of fuels at SW. Filamentous fungi such as Byssochlamys may also provide a surface for bacteria to exploit, encouraging biofilm production in fuel. SEM analysis of fouled coupons showed co-location of rod-shaped bacteria with the fungal filaments (data not shown). Ours is the first study to conclusively show the biocontamination of B20 biodiesel in situ dominated by Byssochlamys-like OTUs, and to establish the relationship between their abundance and in situ corrosion.",

The greatest differences were observed in SW 2, where differences in the relative abundances of the Clostridium sensu strictu 12 and unclassified Acetobacteraceae were noted both over time, and in position within the tank. This could be due to a decrease in the amount of dissolved oxygen both in the fuel and water bottom; OTUs related to Clostridium (strict anaerobic microorganisms) increased over time in the upper position while the Unclassified Acetobacterace decreased. Because each storage tank was in operation while it was being monitored, it is also possible that there was a mixing effect on the community as fuel and water levels changed over time, making it difficult to discern differences in community structure between locations in each tank.

            "text": "The corrosion measured in this study likely resulted from the presence of microbial biofilms causing localized pitting corrosion. The localized production of acids within biofilms created an environment that was favorable for the induction of pitting corrosion similar to that observed within our study. Our in situ study showed greater corrosion near the bottom of each tank where the presence of water and a fuel-water interface was more likely. The interaction of fuel and water allows for enhanced microbial growth, and in turn, greater corrosion than water limited spaces within a fuel tank. Indeed, the greatest corrosion rates observed were in tanks at SW (>8 MPY), where fungal fouling was the most prolific. Rates of corrosion appeared to decline from 7 to 12 months, suggesting passivation may have taken place. Alternatively, the apparent shallowing of pits could be explained by an increase in uniform corrosion, that was observed in SW tanks, which could make pits appear shallower. The exact mechanism of corrosion remains to be deciphered – while steel corrosion is commonly associated with sulfate reduction and the production of sulfide, no sulfate reducing bacteria were identified within any of the community surveys. The greatest levels of corrosion observed in the SW tanks correlated with the presence of anaerobic Clostridia and high relative abundances of OTUs most closely related to Byssochlamys, suggesting that corrosion in these tanks was the result of the production of organic acids during the metabolism (either fermentative or aerobic) of FAMEs present within B20. The presence of organic acids produced as a consequence of fuel degradation may also aide in further growth of organisms that can directly incorporate these metabolites into their own cell wall, as was recently observed in an alkane degrading culture. Although we observed biomass including both bacterial and fungi on polymer coated coupons and polymeric O-rings that could degrade or otherwise damage materials, polymer degradation was not detected. It is possible that the polymers tested in this study were resistant to degradation over the period of the study and that a much longer exposure time was required. Our data supports the idea that tank contamination contributes to an increased risk of corrosion but not, apparently, to polymeric degradation.",

All of the tanks sampled, with the exception of SE E, were cleaned just prior to the beginning of in situ measurements. Within 6 months, however, a dense fungal mat was visible on coupons removed from many of the tanks. Spores of Byssochlamys may enter through the vents from wind-blown dust or enter as a part of the fuel production process in otherwise “clean” fuel. Nevertheless, biofilms were repeatedly found on the in situ coupons and sampling racks near the bottom of each tank in a relatively rapid timeframe. It is highly likely that after a tank is colonized, the established community of the tank is the likely source of recurrent contamination, instead of microorganisms immigrating from air vents or water ingress.",

Together, they illustrate the susceptibility of fuels containing biodiesel to microbial proliferation (fouling), fuel biodegradation, and MIC of associated infrastructure. Here though, we were able to directly link the presence and prevalence of biofilms to pitting corrosion in actively operating B20 storage tanks. We found that a mixed microbial community of filamentous fungi and acid-producing bacteria were able to proliferate in B20 biodiesel storage tanks, cause fouling, degrade fuel by metabolizing the FAME, produce organic acids, and accelerate steel corrosion under biofilms attached to metal surfaces. The same fungal species was responsible for “blooms” of biomass, providing a target for future mitigation strategies. Additional research is underway to characterize this most abundant fungal member of fuels and biofilms observed at both locations.",

As such, the use of biodiesel will likely continue to increase worldwide for the foreseeable future. Operator vigilance in fuel quality and storage conditions is required including early mitigation through water removal, cleaning, and even biocide treatment. Each of these methods would likely be the most effective means of controlling fouling, degradation, and corrosion through the prevention of microbial biofilm establishment.
