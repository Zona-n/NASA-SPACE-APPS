Although typically grown as 1-2mm diameter colonies under certain conditions yeast can form very large (10 + mm in diameter) or ‘giant’ colonies on agar. Giant yeast colonies have been used to study diverse biomedical processes such as cell survival, aging, and the response to cancer pharmacogenomics. Such colonies evolve dynamically into complex stratified structures that respond differentially to environmental cues. Ammonia production, gravity driven ammonia convection, and shear defense responses are key differentiation signals for cell death and reactive oxygen system pathways in these colonies. The response to these signals can be modulated by experimental interventions such as agar composition, gene deletion and application of pharmaceuticals. In this study we used physical factors including colony rotation and microgravity to modify ammonia convection and shear stress as environmental cues and observed differences in the responses of both ammonia dependent and stress response dependent pathways We found that the effects of random positioning are distinct from rotation. Furthermore, both true and simulated microgravity exacerbated both cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely shear-response dependent but each model had a unique response signature as measured by shear stress genes and the promoter set which regulates them These physical techniques permitted a graded manipulation of both convection and ammonia signaling and are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.",

This has made it a powerful model organism with biomedical applications to understand mechanisms of cell-to-cell interactions, cell survival, and aging (Cap et al.; Ayer et al.; Herker et al.). To survive, yeast in liquid cultures must use strategies that are very different from that used by yeast in agar-based colonies (Cap et al.). Survival in liquid culture is dependent on stress defense whereas survival in a colony is dependent on metabolic adaptation and stratification of the population in response to ammonia-mediated signaling (Cap et al.). Both modes of culture have applications for biomedical research. Chemical genomic assays using a deletion series of Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in rich liquid media have provided powerful methods to identify the mechanism of action of known drugs and novel small molecules in vivo including chemotherapy anti-cancer agents (Smith et al.). On the other hand, stratification and divergent metabolic adaption of yeast within a colony on solid agar models many of the changes seen within solid tumors (Cap et al.).",

Multiple flight experiments have verified that S. cerevisiae remains fully viable, and responds to the microgravity environment with changes in metabolism [e.g. increase in phosphate uptake (Berry and Volz) and phenotype [e.g. increase in number and distribution of bud scars (Walther et al.)]. Studies of yeast in space have typically been conducted with liquid cultures. The responses of liquid culture yeast to real (e.g. spaceflight) microgravity and simulated microgravity include changes in reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, as well as shear defense mechanisms (Coleman et al.; Hammond et al.; Johanson et al.; Nislow et al.). We have used a deletion series strategy, similar to chemical genomic assays, to demonstrate that mitochondrial and ribosomal redox gene pathways play a predominant role in the responses of yeast colonies to microgravity (Nislow et al.). This genetic modulation of yeast colonies in real and simulated microgravity is dependent, at least in part, on shear stress promoters, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (Coleman et al.).",

On Earth, yeast cells form giant multicellular colonies with characteristic organized morphologies (Cap et al.). Around day nine, cells at the base of the colony, begin to apoptose and also begin to secrete ammonia. Ammonia signaling induces cells at the top and leading edges of the colony to reprogram their metabolic pathways and divide rapidly, thereby allowing the colony to continue to expand. Yeast colony stratification is indelibly linked to gravity-driven convection, as ammonia production and the gravity driven convection of produced ammonia mediate giant yeast colony differentiation (Cap et al.; Palkova et al.). It is not known how the absence of convection seen in microgravity might affect this process.",

Rotating culture devices have been a popular model to mimic some of the physical factors induced by microgravity during spaceflight (Hammond and Hammond; Lee et al.; Birdsall et al.). Redirecting gravity driven convection, by growing yeast on a vertical rather than horizontal agar slab, disrupts ammonia signaling, altering the redox status of yeast cells and gene expression kinetics during growth of giant yeast colonies (Birdsall et al.). The random positioning machine (RPM), referred to as the 3-D clinostat, is a microgravity simulator based on the principle of ‘gravity-vector-averaging’, which can generate simulated gravity levels from 0g to 1g (Grimm et al.). There is limited data comparing the RPM, simpler 2-D rotation, and true microgravity (Grimm et al.), and controversy as to whether the forces they induce are distinct (Klaus et al.; Murdoch et al.; Wuest et al.).",

PHABs were placed in cold bags at 4∘C, and remained chilled for five days during handoff to the SpaceX-8 rocket. Flight samples were flown to the International Space Station (ISS). Approximately two days post-launch, the growth of the yeast on ISS was initiated by transferring the PHABs to Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus 4 (CGBA4) (Hoehn et al.) that was set to 30 ∘C (BioServe Space Technologies, CO). After 28 days in flight, CGBA4 was commanded down to + 4 ∘C. The following day the PHABs were moved back to cold bags, and returned to Earth the next day on the Dragon capsule. Plates remained chilled for a total of six days during undocking, return to Earth, salvage, and transport to the lab for flow cytometry analysis.  ",

            "text": "The current studies define a role of ammonia signaling and stress pathways using physical methods to disrupt ammonia convection in giant yeast colonies. Several lines of evidence support increased ammonia signaling during the near total lack of convection during colony culture in microgravity. First, of all the models tested, microgravity was the only one to increase both select reactive oxygen species and stress defense genes. These genes include inositol-3-phosphate synthase (INO1), thioredoxin reductase (TRR1), and stress seventy subfamily A (SSA4). These changes were independent of media type. Interestingly, both INO1 and TRR1 are predominantly expressed in the L or lower colony cells when yeast colony stratify into feeder and growing layers in giant colonies (Cap et al.; Palkova et al.). This suggests that ammonia signaling is increased when the generated ammonia cannot convect away from the colonies. Second, the increased expression of the stress defense dependent SSA4 gene is consistent with lack of oxygen availability and carbon dioxide accumulation as these gasses are also affected by the lack of convection. Third, expression of both SSA4 and RPL34B increased more in flight when the classic stress defense promoter Msn4 was deleted. Shear stress promoters have a complex interplay of effects on the expression of genes they modify (Coleman et al.; Hammond et al.; Johanson et al.). Table 5 summarizes the effects of shear press promoters on expression of dependent genes during manipulation of physical forces from this report as well as previous studies. Even within just these two shear stress response genes (SSA4 and RPL34b), with and without deletion of shear stress promoters (Msn4 and Sfp1), there is scant commonality of the gene expression changes or promoter dependence. Interestingly, a similar signaling phenomenon was recently reported for bacteria, where acetate accumulation in the boundary layer affected metabolism, presumably likewise due to lack of convection in microgravity (Zea et al.) and in E. coli where nutrient depletion in simulated microgravity induced stress response genes (Vukanti and Leff).

Induction of apoptosis by simulated microgravity has been seen with other cell types including human lymphocytes (Ward et al.). This increased cell death was greatly increased by deletion of either of the stress responsive promoters Msn4 or Sfp1. The finding of both necrotic and apoptotic cell death is further evidence for activity of both ammonia signaling and stress defense pathways, as ammonia signaling utilizes mostly caspase independent pathways (Vachova and Palkova) and stress defense is mediated mostly by apoptosis as well as autophagy and necrosis (Farrugia and Balzan).",

During culture on the ISS, yeast cultures are also exposed to increased radiation (Nislow et al.). Our previous studies using yeast deletion series in liquid culture to evaluate the effects of spaceflight revealed two dominant responses: radiation/DNA repair and reactive oxygen pathways (Nislow et al.). We conclude that the ISS provides a unique suite of stimuli with distinct set of responses: the question is how to translate these properties to i) further NASA’s program objectives, ii) support commercial development, and iii) address unmet clinical needs.",

These differences included gene expression changes mediated by shear stress promoters, redox status, and apoptosis. Hence, we conclude that the forces induced by random positioning and rotation are distinct. Many resources are available for scientists seeking to study the effects of gravity on biologic systems (Brungs et al.; Frett et al.) and researchers should be mindful that fluidity of the culture milieu and shear stress at the membrane surface are likely to be important variables affecting how cells sense gravity (Kohn et al.; van Loon). In our model system composed of a near-solid colony of yeast, receiving nutrients from an agar gel at its base, and using a gas, ammonia, as one means of driving differentiation within the colony, spaceflight, rotating wall vessel and random positioning generate different effects. In free-floating liquid systems such as U937 cells growing in suspension (Bradamante et al.), HUVEC cells adherent to Cytodex beads (Bradamante et al.), or thyroid cells growing as spheroids (Warnke et al.) rotating wall vessel, random positioning machines, and spaceflight had very similar effects.",

Gene deletion, although targeted to a single locus, will often cause follow-on effects in multiple integrated pathways, especially when promoters are deleted (Park et al.). Further, there are clinically important applications. Analysis of yeast survival pathways offers powerful techniques to address drug metabolic mechanisms for repurposing of pharmaceuticals (Lee et al.), including identification of unique targets (Blackman et al.) and buffering pathways required to respond to drugs. Further, yeast colony differentiation recapitulates many of the stratification mechanisms of tumorigenesis (Cap et al.; Birdsall et al.). In conclusion, by allowing graded manipulation of a combination of convection and ammonia signaling, while avoiding secondary effects of gene deletion, these physical techniques are primed to substantially contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation.",
