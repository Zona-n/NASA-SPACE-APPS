To better characterize this effect, we generated single-cell, multi-ome, cell-free RNA (cfRNA), biochemical, and hematology data for the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission crew. We found that 18 cytokines/chemokines related to inflammation, aging, and muscle homeostasis changed after spaceflight. In I4 single-cell multi-omics data, we identified a “spaceflight signature” of gene expression characterized by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways. We confirmed the presence of this signature in independent datasets, including the NASA Twins Study, the I4 skin spatial transcriptomics, and 817 NASA GeneLab mouse transcriptomes. Finally, we observed that (1) T cells showed an up-regulation of FOXP3, (2) MHC class I genes exhibited long-term suppression, and (3) infection-related immune pathways were associated with microbiome shifts. In summary, this study reveals conserved and distinct immune disruptions occurring and details a roadmap for potential countermeasures to preserve astronaut health.",

Since 1961, over 675 astronauts have traveled to space; studies on some crew members have shown significant immune stress related to spaceflight. Given that more individuals with diverse physical and biomedical backgrounds are traveling into space—and that many more commercial missions are planned (e.g., Polaris Dawn, Axiom)—an urgent goal of aerospace medicine is to understand better how the immune system responds to and recovers from spaceflight for the broader civilian population. Moreover, such profiles of cellular and molecular changes in commercial crews can guide personalized countermeasures for the missions and eventually lead to better crew performance and safety.",

While these findings show that the spaceflight environment affects the human immune system, they do not reveal the underlying pathways and mechanisms therein, underscoring the need for further studies. Also, since spaceflight phenocopies many of the effects of aging and aging-related disease (e.g., bone density and muscle loss), a better characterization of immune system changes during the extreme physiological stressor of spaceflight can offer insights into immune dysregulation and functional deterioration on Earth.",

For example, the NASA Twins Study used gene expression to investigate immune changes stemming from a year-long mission, and found unprecedented levels of cytokines like IL-6 and IL-10, and gene expression changes in both B-cells and T-cells. However, a major limitation of that study was the sample size, as it involved only one flight subject. It additionally used a bulk-cell analysis for most of the transcriptome (preventing observations at a single-cell resolution) and lacked a chromatin analysis using assays for transposase-accessible chromatin accessibility (ATAC) data, which is critical for understanding changes in genome regulation and long-term stress response.",

We longitudinally analyzed single-nucleus gene expression (snRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq), and single-cell T/B cell antigen receptor sequences from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In addition, we integrated this multi-omics data with a clinical profile of a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and cytokine/chemokine/growth factor/metabolite measures. We also profiled cell frequencies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), biochemical profiling, differential gene/peak expression, enriched biological pathways, over-represented transcription factor binding site (TFBS), antibody isotype, mutation profiles of BCR/TCR, cell-free RNA (cfRNA) in plasma, and association with skin, oral, and nasal microbiome changes.

These proteins have critical roles in immune response, muscle homeostasis, and hematopoiesis, but are not normally associated with systemic inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 1e). Moreover, some cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-1RA, and Fractalkine) are considered exerkines, cytokines produced by the muscle and other tissues during exercise. As such, we then examined if muscle tissues could be the source of these immune markers. Significant increases in some myokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-7) were indeed observed, further supporting muscles as a possible source (Fig. 1b) of these molecules, and indicating a physiological response to microgravity rather than a purely inflammatory response.",

Notably, chromatin accessibility responses to spaceflight exhibited even greater cell type-specificity (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c) than DEGs, with the most changes still appearing at R + 1.

Second, we found that the TCR V(D)J repertoire from L-3 to R + 82 was stable in terms of mutations (Supplementary Fig. 7e, f). Conversely, the total number of BCR mutations increases relative to pre-flight at R + 1 (64.6 vs 61.6) and R + 45 (65.5 vs 61.6) (Supplementary Fig. 7g, h). Moreover, we found that cell differentiation and cell proliferation pathway scores were decreased (around 5–10%) at R + 1 for both CD4 T and CD8 T cells, which mirrors the T cell suppression previously observed in simulated GCR irradiation, simulated microgravity, and Space Shuttle missions (Supplementary Data 4). Similarly, the CD4 central memory T cell (CD4 TCM) differentiation pathway and memory T cell activation scores were decreased in CD4 effector memory T cells (CD4 TEM) and CD8 central memory T cells (CD8 TCM) at R + 1. However, monocytes and DCs showed more mixed phenotypes, with activation, differentiation, aggregation, and extravasation scores all dysregulated at R + 1.

Of note, the CD16 monocytes showed the highest number of enriched, known pathways (Supplementary Fig. 9c), and CD14 monocytes showed the longest persistence of these changes, indicating a slower recovery after spaceflight. We then used the DARs’ chromatin accessibility data to compare over-represented TF motifs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 3), and intersected these TFs with the literature. For the top 12 motifs from T cells, a novel set of spaceflight-responsive TFs was identified (KFL16, ETV1, ZNF148, RREB1, GABPA, KLF9), as well as some known, including MAZ, Wt1, KLF4, and KLF5. For B cells, novel TFs included SPIB, ZKSCAN5, IKZF1, and EBF3, while previously identified TFs included STAT, IRF1, EHF, and Arid3a. Interestingly, these TFs are all key to B cell function: STATs mediate cytokine responses (IL7, B cell differentiation, and control of the germinal center reaction); SPIB regulates the expression of the B cell receptor, CD40L, BAFF, and TLR ligands, and IKZF1 is a transcription factor essential for B cell activation, maturation, and differentiation. For monocytes and DCs, novel TFs included SPIB, SPIC, HLF, IKZF1, ELF3, CTCFL, and ZKSCAN5, and known TFs included CEBPD, STAT1, CTCF, EHF, Arid3a, and IRF1.

Also, mitotic spindle, UV response DN pathway, and TCF21 targets pathway were also consistently, significantly up-regulated (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Of note, the pathway scores (−log10(padj)*sign(NES)) were positively correlated in the I4 murine signatures (Pearson correlation, R = 0.82, slope: 0.69) (Fig. 2d).

Additionally, the Twins’ GSEA profiles overlapped with the I4 GSEA profiles, showing enrichment in OXPHOS, Myc targets v1, and UV response, consistent with the I4 signature (Fig. 2e).

First, to validate the CD14 dysregulation, we compared the I4 CD14 monocyte data to previously reported monocyte dysregulation markers linked to clinical symptoms, which confirmed the down-regulation of five known markers in the I4 CD14 monocytes (e.g., SELL, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB5, IL6, CD14) and an increase in TLR4 across both gene expression and ATAC-seq data (Fig. 3a). When examining I4 immune cell DEGs (padj < 0.05) (Supplementary Data 8), we also found a decrease in the pathways associated with response to infection, including COVID-19, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, CMV, tuberculosis, graft-versus-host defense, and Salmonella infection (KEGG pathways, p-adj < 0.05, Supplementary Data 8), and validated with a GSEA analysis (Fig. 3b). Finally, to examine the capacity for B-cell function, we examined the increased BCR mutation rate (Supplementary Fig. 7g), which is caused by somatic hypermutation secondary to antigen exposure or inflammatory stimuli. Indeed, single-cell expression data suggested possible up-regulation of BCR signaling pathway genes in B cells immediately post-flight (Supplementary Fig. 12a).",

In T cells, FOXP3 target gene enrichment score was increased (Fig. 3d), and again confirmed by the motif activity score of ATAC data (Supplementary Fig. 9d). Changes in FOXP3 suggested changes in T cell regulation during spaceflight, and potentially altered immune function post-flight, which is in line with the GSEA results and KEGG pathways (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Data 8). We further validated FOXP3 upregulation in T cells and Treg cell activation after spaceflight by analyzing Treg activation markers and FOXP3 target genes across T cells (Fig. 3e, f, Supplementary Fig. 12d). Our data indeed showed an increase in Treg activation markers at R + 1, which recovered over time in both gene expression and ATAC data in both T cells and Treg cells (Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 12d).

Second, the overlap of up-/down-regulated DEGs between females and males showed a partial overlap (Fig. 4b), with down-regulated DEGs showing a higher overlap percentage (average of up-regulated genes: 51.9%, average of down-regulated genes: 84.1%).

We used a regression-based approach (See Methods) to illuminate relationships between DEGs and bacterial/viral taxonomic abundances across 10 body sites derived from shotgun metatranscriptomic and metagenomic sequencing (Supplementary Data 13). We compared the results of our associations across regularized (LASSO) regression and linear mixed models across different normalization methods and different taxonomic classifiers and ranks, finding overall concordant results (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15).

GO term overrepresentation analysis indicated enrichment (padj < 0.05) for diverse pathways related to bacterial and viral response and immune cell change (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Data 14). Null hypothesis testing on randomized data had limited overlap with the results from the real analysis, both in terms of LASSO coefficients as well as nominal and Bonferroni-adjusted p-values (Fig. 5b). When considering only genes that were Bonferroni significant and had non-zero lasso coefficients, CD14 monocytes had the most bacterial associations (Fig. 5c). Viral associations were, by comparison, predominantly in NK cells and T cells. As such, the enrichment of pathogen-response pathways linked to microbial features indicates that microbiome shifts may drive a portion of immune response to spaceflight. Various genes for cell proliferation (i.e., STAT1), ribosomal genes, and various pathways of pathogen infection (RPL28, RPS27A, RPL10, RPL13, RPL11, RPSA, UBA52) were associated with bacteria (Fig. 5d, top panel), notably in CD14 monocytes. Viruses (Fig. 5d, bottom panel) were also associated with genes involved in inflammatory response but with some distinct associations.

Moreover, these data showed a pronounced sex- and cell-type specificity regarding responsiveness and recovery from spaceflight, with the most and least sensitive cells being CD14 monocytes and CD16 monocytes and T cells, respectively.

As such, our results focused on significantly shifted genes and pathways consistently observed across all crew members. In addition, we utilized a battery of other studies to validate our observations, including other astronaut data, NASA Twins Study data, JAXA CFE data, in vitro microgravity-simulated PBMCs, I4 cfRNA data, meta-analysis of the GeneLab mouse studies, as well as other omics data from the I4 mission. Of particular interest are the differential changes between I4 PBMCs and the in vitro-simulated microgravity PBMCs, which enabled a novel way to differentiate the likely impact of radiation vs. microgravity on human PBMCs, which indicates that radiation is a likely larger driver of the cellular responses. Of course, simulated cells can still be influenced by other experimental factors (e.g., space radiation, fluid shifts, environment, temperature), and future studies should seek to confirm and expand these DEGs related to radiation vs. microgravity.",

            "text": "Sex-specific variation in immune response is frequently observed in clinical settings, but poorly understood, and this phenomenon has yet to be investigated in-depth at the single-cell level during spaceflight. Here, we observed that males appear to be more affected by spaceflight, for almost all cell types and metrics, experiencing more DEGs, slower recovery to the baseline of DEGs, and a slower recovery of the chromatin accessibility. In addition, IL-6, IL-8, and fibrinogen differences by sex were confirmed in the replication cohort of NASA astronauts (n = 64). Sex differences also were observed in certain CD and HLA genes (Supplementary Data 9, 10), including a greater number of downregulated HLA genes in male DCs (Supplementary Data 10). For example, CD83 is expressed on mature dendritic cells, and it was downregulated in male DCs at R + 1 (Supplementary Data 10). Under simulated microgravity, DCs had decreased expressions of HLA-DR and impaired phagocytosis, which aligns with our results. While dysregulation of immune function, oxidative phosphorylation, and Myc target pathways were conserved in both males and females, the aggregate data thus far indicates that the gene regulatory and immune response to spaceflight is more sensitive in males. More studies will be needed to confirm these trends, but such results can have implications for recovery times and possibly crew selection (e.g., more females) for high-altitude, lunar, and deep space missions.",

            "text": "We additionally observed increased expression in many immune cell pathways associated with pathogens. Immune cell activity is known to be specifically associated with shifts in host bacterial and viral content. Microgravity has the potential to affect gene regulations in various tissues, including interactions between the host immune system and microbiome. Bacteria can directly regulate immune cell activity and viral activation, and herpes virus reactivation is associated with spaceflight. When associating microbiome features with DEGs, we identified that many of the pathways most associated with bacterial and viral shifts before and after flight were additionally related to pathogen colonization. As a result, we hypothesize that a portion of the immune activation in flight could be arising from microbiome shifts. However, our microbiome integration results are descriptive and, in future studies, could be further strengthened by mechanistic experiments, targeted microbiome interventions, and larger sample sizes. Further, although we used techniques standard for the field, other microbiome analytic methods (i.e., gene-level analysis and other machine-learning approaches) could tease further signals from the data. Indeed, the substantial differences between bacterial and viral responses indicate discrete mechanisms of immune response and provide targets for future studies.",

Depletion of granulocytes was performed either directly from whole blood using the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail or by cell sorting after PBMC isolation. Whole blood was incubated in a granulocyte depletion cocktail (50 µL/mL of blood) for 20 min at room temperature. Next, Ficoll-Paque Plus (Cytiva) was utilized to isolate PBMCs by density gradient centrifugation. After washes in PBS with 2% FBS (GIBCO) were completed, isolated PBMCs were cell sorted to remove granulocytes only if the RosetteSepTM granulocyte depletion cocktail was not added to whole blood prior to density gradient centrifugation. Granulocytes were identified using side scatter and the lymphocyte and monocyte fractions were sorted using a 100 µm nozzle (BD Aria). Following granulocyte depletion, PBMCs were split into two fractions to generate single cell V(D)J T-cell and B-cell libraries or multiomic (GEX and ATAC) libraries. To capture T-cell and B-cell V(D)J repertoire, single cell gel beads-in-emulsion and libraries were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ v2, 10X Genomics). Prior to single cell multiome ATAC and gene expression sequencing, nuclei isolation was performed by resuspending PBMCs in 100 µL of cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 0.01% digitonin, 1% BSA, 1 mM DTT and 1 U/µL RNAse inhibitor.

After centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), nuclei were resuspended in a diluted nuclei buffer (10X Genomics Single Cell Multiome ATAC kit A) at a concentration of 6000 nuclei per µL.

The libraries sequenced for each timepoint included ATAC, GEX, and VDJ (TCR + BCR) libraries. Four libraries corresponding to the four astronauts were prepared for each timepoint and library type, except for the June and August timepoints for which VDJ libraries were not prepared. In total, there were 24 ATAC and GEX libraries and 32 VDJ libraries, which were sequenced in three batches. The concentration of each library was taken using the Invitrogen Qubit 1X dsDNA HS Assay Kit and run on Agilent Tapestation 2100 using Agilent Technologies D1000 reagents and Screentape for fragment analysis. The nanomolarity of each sample was calculated using the formula ((concentration (ng/µl)/ (660 g/mol)* fragment size (bp))*10^6. After the nanomolarity was obtained for each sample, the target nanomolarity was determined using the lowest nanomolarity of the sample libraries. The desired number of reads per sample was determined based on the following criterion: 35,000 read pairs per cell for ATAC libraries, 25,000 read pairs per cell for GEX libraries, and 5000 read pairs per cell for VDJ libraries. Following this, the total number of reads per pool of samples was determined by adding all the read pairs per sample, and the percentage of total read pairs of each pool that is made up of each sample was determined using this formula (desired read pairs for sample/total read pairs for the pool) × 100. The target volume (µL) for each pool was determined based on requirements for sequencing, final molarity, etc. In this case, 200 µL was used for the ATAC library pool, and 100 µL was used for both the VDJ and GEX library pools. The target volume (µL) for each sample was then calculated based on the percentage of the total pool calculated earlier, using the desired final pool volume. Based on the target nanomolarity, sample nanomolarity, and sample target volume, the input volume (uL) for each sample was calculated using the following formula ((target nanomolarity * sample target volume)/sample nanomolarity). If the volume of each individual sample does not meet the target sample volume the rest of the volume can be made up using nuclease-free water. The total volume of both the samples and nuclease-free water should add up to the target pool volume. Following these pooling protocols, the samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system.",

Subsequently, DESeq2 was used to perform differential expression analysis between the spaceflight and ground control mice while adjusting for age, sex, tissue, sacrifice site, and mission duration. The meta-analysis was done using DeSeq2 (wald test, two-tailed) based on batch(study)-corrected count matrix calculated with combat-seq. Multiple testing adjustment was done using Benjamini-hochberg. This analysis resulted in a ‘spaceflight signature in mice’ consisting of 2184 differentially expressed genes (1288 up-regulated and 896 down-regulated).

Four replicate of OCT-embedded tissues were placed on a single slide, per astronaut,including pre and post flight replicates. Tissues were then cryosectioned at 5 µm thickness and attached to glass microscope slides (Fisher Scientific, cat# 22-037-246). Immunofluorescent visualization marker for Pan-Cytokeratin (PanCK, Novus cat# NBP2-33200, Alexa Fluor® 532, clone ID AE1 + AE3), fibroblast activation protein (FAP, Abcam cat# ab222924, Alexa Fluor® 594, clone ID EPR20021) and smooth muscle actin (SMA, R&D Systems cat# IC1420R, Alexa Fluor® 647, clone 1A4) were used for region or interest (ROI) selection. The DSP whole transcriptome assay (WTA) was used to assess genes collected in each ROI. For DSP processing, OCT slides were thawed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) at 4 °C followed by PBS washes for thorough fixation. After washes, slides were prepared following the automated Leica Bond RNA Slide Preparation Protocol for fixed frozen samples, digesting samples with 1.0 µg/mL proteinase K for 15 min, and antigen retrieval for 20 min at 100 °C (NanoString, no. MAN-10115-05). In situ hybridizations with the GeoMx Whole Transcriptome Atlas Panel (WTA, 18,677 genes) at 4 nM final concentration were done in Buffer R (NanoString). Morphology markers were prepared for four slides concurrently using Syto13 (DNA), PanCK, FAP and SMA in Buffer W for a total volume of 225 μl per slide. Slides incubated with 225 µl of morphology marker solution at RT for 1 h, then washed in SSC and loaded onto the NanoString DSP instrument. The 20× scan was used to select freeform ROIs to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. OE ROIs covered spinous and granular layers, while IE ROIs covered the basal layer, identified from the staining of the tissue. To ensure proper selection and to avoid overlaps across different ROI types, small gaps between each ROI type were made. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ files corresponding to each ROI. FASTQ files were then converted to digital count conversion files using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. Additional methods can be found in ref. .",

Raw reads were trimmed galore, then aligned using STAR2 alignment to mm10 or Salmon to Ensembl transcripts. Gene counties were obtained using featurecounts. All RNAseq differential expression analyses were performed using DESeq2(1.38.3) in RStudio (R, 4.2.3). Heatmaps and volcano plots were produced using the R packages ComplexHeatmap (2.15.1) and EnhancedVolcano (1.16.0), respectively.",

STITCH collects information from multiple sources and individual scores from each source are combined into an overall confidence score.

The universal gene set contains all genes that interact with at least one compound. The compound with low p-value interacts with a higher proportion of the DEGs than that expected by chance. Statistically significant compounds were then obtained after Bonferroni adjustment of p values. The pipeline for this compound analysis is implemented in the gcea R package (https://github.com/nguyenkhiemv/gcea).",
