While an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has long been shown in radiotherapy patients, adverse cardiovascular effects, such as ischemic heart disease, have also been described following exposure to doses much lower than in radiation therapy, often decades after radiation exposure. Astronauts traveling beyond low earth orbit (LEO), as in a mission to Mars or a near earth asteroid, will be continuously exposed to low dose-rate ionizing radiation, including γ-rays released as secondary radiation resultant from particle radiation interacting with the spacecraft or other shielding material. Hence, there is a concern about potential degenerative tissue effects in the heart with the exposure to ionizing radiation that occurs during space travel.",

One characteristic of ionizing radiation is the formation of free radicals, e.g. reactive oxygen species (ROS). An increase in oxidative stress has been observed in Russian cosmonauts and in space flown animal models. Recently, Azimzadeh et al., demonstrated a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), indicative of an increase in oxidative stress in post-mortem left ventricular tissue from Mayak nuclear workers that had been exposed to low dose-rate γ-radiation. Furthermore, Soucy et al. demonstrated increased activity of xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that generates ROS, in the rat aorta following exposure to 5 Gy γ-radiation.

            "text": "Another mechanism by which radiation may affect the heart is through DNA methylation, an important mechanism of maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Cardiovascular disease is associated with alterations of DNA methylation. Moreover, radiation exposure has recently been shown to alter the DNA methylation patterns in the mouse heart. Methionine and the methionine cycle are critical for the production of S-adenosyl- L-methionine (SAM), a major methyl donor. Impairments in the methionine cycle up to 48 hours following radiation have been observed in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-361 by O’Leary et al. through the suppression of methionine adenosyltranseferase by the long noncoding RNA, PARTICLE. O’leary et al. observed a transient increase in PARTICLE 4 and 24 hours after 0.25 Gy γ-irradiation and a corresponding decrease in SAM 4 hours after radiation. While methionine metabolism directly influences DNA methylation potential, it also plays an important role in redox status. Increases in oxidative stress result in homocysteine, a reversible product in the methionine cycle, to be diverted away from the methionine cycle; thus, 1) decreasing the ability of the cells or tissues to methylate DNA and 2) supporting the synthesis of the antioxidant GSH through the irreversible transsulfuration of methionine. Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that exposure to low absorbed doses of space radiation resulted in long-term shifts in the heart tissue methionine concentrations, the ratio of SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and DNA methylation.",

Recently, Mao et al. showed that a combined exposure to hindlimb unloading (HU) and low-dose rate γ-radiation may increase oxidative damage and decrease antioxidant protein content in the mouse brain. To be able to model simultaneous HU and exposure to low-dose rate ionizing radiation, Mao et al. placed cages of hind-limb unloaded mice onto Co-57 plates that emitted ionizing radiation in the form of γ-rays at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h.",

Mature (6 months old), female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to low-dose-rate γ-irradiation (Co-57), were subjected to HU, or received a simultaneous combination of HU and γ-irradiation (HU+Co-57) for 21 days as previously described. Chronic low-dose rate irradiation was performed by housing mice for 21 days in cages placed on Co-57 plates (GPI; Stoughton, WI), as previously described. Co-57 plates had an active area of 16.5 x 24 inches and a dose uniformity of ± 5%. Mice received a cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy at an average dose rate of 0.01 cGy/h. Dose calibration was performed with multiple thermoluminescent dosimeters per cage, as detailed in prior studies. Mice were hind-limb unloaded as previously described. In short, anti-orthostatic suspension was achieved by attaching a tail harness and suspending mice by the tail harness to elevate the hindquarters above the cage floor with a 30° head-down tilt. Mice remained in HU for the duration of 21 days. After completion of the 21 days of HU, γ-irradiation, or a simultaneous exposure to HU + γ-irradiation, all mice were removed from HU and the radiation source until the time of sacrifice.

HPLC was performed to assess levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), methionine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and expressed in nmol/mg total protein. Glutathione oxidation was expressed as a ratio of GSH:GSSG and methylation potential was expressed as a ratio of SAM:SAH.",

HU was used in this study as it is a widely accepted, terrestrial model of the mechanical unloading and fluid shifts that occur during exposure to microgravity. HU was utilized in combination with exposure to low-dose rate γ-irradiation, in an effort to mimic the effects of a concurrent microgravity and radiation insult on the heart in a ground based model. More specifically, we assessed markers of oxidative stress, DNA methylation, inflammatory cell infiltration and remodeling in cardiac tissue obtained from 6 months old female C57BL/6J mice 7 days, 1 month and 9 months after completion of 21 days of HU, 21 days of exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation, or 21 days HU concurrent with 21 day exposure to low-dose rate γ-radiation. This approach allowed us to study the effects of chronic low-dose rate radiation concurrent with HU. The animal model we have employed may also be relevant for low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation as may occur in certain populations on Earth, such as airline crew, miners, or radiological workers.",

            "text": "Glutathione, through its oxidation to glutathione disulfide, plays an important role in alleviating oxidative stress and has been used as an index of total tissue oxidative stress. In the present study, GSH:GSSG ratios were decreased both 7 days and 1 month following exposure to HU or γ-irradiation. The data in our current study extend the finding of Sridharan et al., who used an animal model of high-dose local heart irradiation, by demonstrating that the GSH:GSSG ratio is sensitive to γ-radiation at a whole body, total low-dose of 0.04 Gy. Our data do not show a greater decrement in GSH:GSSG following 1 month of normal ambulation post-HU and no significant differences in GSH:GSSG ratios between groups were observed 9 months after treatment. The decrease in cardiac tissue GSH:GSSG 7 days and 1 month after irradiation combined with HU suggests that the heart may be more susceptible to oxidative insults. However, other indicators of oxidative stress such as the cardiac expression of Nrf2 and 4-HNE adducts did not significantly change at our measured endpoints, indicating that the hearts were not under severe oxidative stress at those times. Since the first post-treatment time point of analysis was 7 days, we cannot exclude that alterations in Nrf2 and/or 4-HNE may have occurred immediately after completion of HU or γ-irradiation. Moreover, 4-HNE alone is not an optimal indicator of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, future studies would benefit by including additional methods to measure lipid peroxidation, perhaps by malondialdehyde assay. These data suggest that a decrease in left ventricular GSH:GSSG ratios results from an exposure to simulated microgravity or to low-dose/dose-rate γ-radiation, and that the combination of simulated microgravity and γ-irradiation produces a greater affect than either insult alone, measured up to one month after treatment. However, results from later time points suggest that a recovery occurs over the course of several months post-treatment.",

Proteomic analysis of heart tissue samples of Mayak workers that had been exposed to low doses of γ-radiation over prolonged periods of time showed a decrease in both Cu/ZnSOD and MnSOD protein levels in individuals who had received less than 0.1 Gy and individuals who had received more than 0.5 Gy. On the other hand, Casciati et al. reported a decreased anti-oxidant response, including a decrease of Cu/ZnSOD protein content in hippocampus isolated 6 months after 2 Gy cranial x-ray irradiation of 10 day old mice, but not from mice irradiated at the lower dose of 0.1 Gy. Proteomic analysis by Kempf et al. showed that chronic low-dose (0.3 Gy) γ-radiation is not associated with a decrease in anti-oxidant proteins, like SOD, but is associated with a decrease in lipid peroxidation in the hippocampus of Apo E-/- mice. The studies by Casciati et al. and Kempf et al. used doses of radiation that were several fold higher than the 0.04 Gy γ-radiation dose used in this study. However, a separate study by Mao et al., in the hippocampus collected from the same mice used in the current study, showed elevated 4-HNE levels 7 days and 9 months after HU or the combination of HU combined with chronic γ-irradiation. Furthermore, Mao et al. also showed a decreased SOD activity 7 days after HU and 9 months after both HU and the combination of HU with γ-irradiation. In contrast, our study of cardiac tissue did not elicit any differences in 4-HNE, GPX 1/2, and only a slight reduction in MnSOD protein content 9 months after γ-irradiation. Taken together, these data indicate that the alterations in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation that occur following HU and low dose-rate γ-irradiation may be tissue specific.",

Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses suggest that structural remodeling after single, high-dose radiation exposure occurs through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and transforming growth factor beta signaling. Furthermore, structural remodeling of the heart may also occur after exposure to microgravity. For instance, Westby et al. reported a decreased left ventricular mass in subjects following exposure to simulated microgravity via head down tilt that persisted beyond the recovery of other cardiac mal-adaptations associated with simulated microgravity. These results suggest that structural remodeling occurs following radiation exposure and simulated microgravity; however, our study, which used a low-dose, whole body γ-radiation, did not elicit a significant increase of collagen in any group. It is possible that the cumulative dose of 0.04 Gy radiation in the present experiment was too low to elicit the cardiac remodeling that occurs at higher doses. While we used the same endpoints as previously used in animal models of high-dose radiation exposure, it is possible that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation.",

Hence, we examined the common T-lymphocyte cell surface marker CD-2 as an indicator of cardiac T-lymphocyte infiltration. Previously, Patties et al. showed increased inflammatory markers 40 weeks after 8 and 16 Gy high-dose rate x-ray irradiation, but no significant differences after a low-dose 2 Gy irradiation. Increased inflammation is associated with decreased cardiac function. In contrast to Patties et al., we observed a significant decrease in T-lymphocyte CD-2 protein content 4 months after treatment. The chronic low-dose rate exposures in our study likely induce very different inflammatory responses compared to high-dose rate single dose irradiation. Alternatively, the decreased CD-2 protein content in our study may be reflective of a systemic decrease in T-lymphocytes, which may result in an impaired immune response after exposure to microgravity, low-dose radiation, or a combination of the two, which may recover over time. Space flight is associated with a compromised immune system, and data from Skylab and shuttle missions indicate a post-flight decrease in lymphocyte cell numbers. Microgravity and low-dose rate γ-radiation may be responsible, in part, for the impaired immune function associated with spaceflight. Future experiments should include complementary analyses, such as peripheral blood and cardiac T-lymphocyte cell counts.",

The anti-oxidant protein MnSOD showed a small decrease 9 months after exposure to low-dose γ-radiation. However, this difference was not reflected in the other oxidative stress proteins we evaluated. Our analyses of collagen expression and α-SMC actin revealed no significant cardiac remodeling. It is possible that our study was limited by sample size and that we did not assess the appropriate parameters that indicate cardiac remodeling after HU or low-dose/dose-rate γ-irradiation.
