            "text": "A reciprocal association between bone marrow fat and bone mass has been reported in ovariectomized rodents, suggesting that bone marrow adipogenesis has a negative effect on bone growth and turnover balance. Mice with loss of function mutations in kit receptor (kitW/W-v) have no bone marrow adipocytes in tibia or lumbar vertebra. We therefore tested the hypothesis that marrow fat contributes to development of osteopenia by comparing the skeletal response to ovariectomy (ovx) in growing wild type (WT) and bone marrow adipocyte-deficient kitW/W-v mice. Mice were ovx at 4 weeks of age and sacrificed 4 or 10 weeks post-surgery. Body composition was measured at necropsy by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Cortical (tibia) and cancellous (tibia and lumbar vertebra) bone architecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography. Bone marrow adipocyte size and density, osteoblast- and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters, and bone formation were determined by histomorphometry. Ovx resulted in an increase in total body fat mass at 10 weeks post-ovx in both genotypes, but the response was attenuated in the in kitW/W-v mice. Adipocytes were present in bone marrow of tibia and lumbar vertebra in WT mice and bone marrow adiposity increased following ovx. In contrast, marrow adipocytes were not detected in either intact or ovx kitW/W-v mice. However, ovx in WT and kitW/W-v mice resulted in statistically indistinguishable changes in cortical and cancellous bone mass, cortical and cancellous bone formation rate, and cancellous osteoblast and osteoclast-lined bone perimeters. In conclusion, our findings do not support a causal role for increased bone marrow fat as a mediator of ovx-induced osteopenia in mice.",

Fat depots generally act as energy reserves in which fatty acids are taken up by adipocytes from lipoproteins and subsequently released into the general circulation following lipolysis. Although bone marrow fat is highly labile, bone marrow adipocytes increase in number and sequester and esterify fatty acids during severe caloric restriction, suggesting that the bone marrow fat depot does not function as a typical energy reservoir for peripheral tissues.",

These findings have fueled speculation that increased marrow fat may lead to bone loss. Proposed mechanisms for the putative detrimental effects of marrow fat on bone metabolism fall into two general, though non-mutually exclusive, categories: 1) differentiation of stromal cells into adipocytes occurring at the expense of osteoblast differentiation, and 2) adipocyte production of factors (adipokines) which antagonize bone formation and/or increase bone resorption.",

A deficiency in the transcription factor PPARγ reduces marrow fat and enhances osteogenesis in mice. In contrast, osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ exaggerates ovariectomy (ovx)-induced osteopenia in mice, while PPARγ agonists are associated with bone loss in insulin-resistant humans.

            "text": "Estrogen plays a key role in skeletal growth and maturation and in the maintenance of bone balance in adults. As in humans, gonadal insufficiency in female rodents is associated with increased peripheral fat accumulation, increased bone marrow adiposity, accelerated bone turnover, and osteopenia. However, in spite of a strong inverse association between bone marrow fat and bone mass, it has proven difficult to directly test the hypothesis that excess fat accumulation in bone marrow is responsible for ovx-induced osteopenia. In this regard, we recently reported that kit receptor-deficient kitW/W-v mice have no bone marrow adipocytes but are able to produce osteoblasts and osteoclasts. We therefore reasoned that if bone marrow adipose tissue contributes to the detrimental skeletal effects of estrogen deficiency, kitW/W-v mice would be resistant to ovx-induced osteopenia. We tested this hypothesis by determining the effect of ovx on body composition, bone mass and architecture, and dynamic and cellular indices of bone turnover in growing WT and kitW/W-v mice.",

In the first experiment, WT and kitW/W-v mice were maintained for 10 weeks following surgery and sacrificed at 14 weeks of age to evaluate the long-term skeletal response to ovx. In the second, follow-up experiment, the mice were maintained for 4 weeks following surgery and sacrificed at 8 weeks of age to assess short-term skeletal response to ovx. Specifically, the follow up study was designed to evaluate whether lack of adipocytes influences the effects of ovx on cancellous bone formation. The fluorochrome calcein (Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered at 20 mg/kg 7 and 1 days prior to sacrifice (14-week-old mice) or 4 and 1 days prior to sacrifice (8-week-old mice). The mice were anesthetized with 2–3% isofluorane delivered in oxygen and body composition determined via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) using a PIXImus small animal densitometer (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). Death was induced by cardiac excision, and tibiae (both experiments) and lumbar vertebrae (experiment 2 only) were removed and stored in 70% ethanol for micro-computed tomography (μCT) and histomorphometric analysis.

Changes in the circulating level of estrogen directly modulate the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes. Also, changes in estrogen levels have species-, skeletal compartment-, and age-specific effects on bone architecture and turnover. The normal increase in estrogen levels at puberty accelerates epiphyseal closure and promotes accumulation of cancellous bone at mechanically loaded skeletal sites. Not surprisingly, estrogen acts in consort with anabolic hormones during growth to determine peak bone mass, and with reproductive hormones to regulate mineral availability during pregnancy and lactation. In humans, bone metabolism is disrupted by natural and surgery-induced menopause. The disruption results in accelerated but often unbalanced bone turnover which can lead to rapid local bone loss.",

In spite of increases in bone formation, marrow volume increased and cancellous bone volume decreased. It is well established that bone mass and architectural changes following ovx are not uniform throughout the skeleton. Specifically, osteopenia only occurs at sites where increases in bone formation are inadequate to match the increase in bone resorption. For example, ovx results in increased bone turnover in both the proximal metaphysis and epiphysis of the tibia in rats yet rapid bone loss occurs in the metaphysis whereas cancellous bone in the epiphysis is spared. Even in the metaphysis, bone is selectively lost from sites experiencing low strain energy levels. At the periosteum, a skeletal compartment with minimal bone resorption in rodents, bone formation predominates following ovx, at times leading to a net increase in cortical bone mass. Adipokines produced by bone marrow adipocytes could contribute to osteopenia by altering bone growth or the local balance between bone formation and resorption in favor of the latter. We evaluated these possibilities by investigating the skeletal response to ovx in kitW/W-v mice. KitW/W-v mice have no marrow adipocytes but exhibited ovx-induced skeletal changes strikingly similar to those in WT mice. We interpret this finding as strong evidence that an increase in bone marrow adiposity following ovx is not required for the dramatic skeletal responses to ovx.",

As a consequence, activation of kit signaling by kit ligand is greatly reduced in kit receptor-expressing cells in kitW/W-v mice. The skeletal phenotype of kitW/W-v mice has not been described in detail. In the present study, growing mice and mice approaching skeletal maturity were evaluated. Our results suggest that kit receptor deficiency results in cortical as well as premature age-related cancellous osteopenia. The lower cortical bone mass in the mutant mice appears to be largely due to a reduction in bone growth. The lower cancellous bone volume in the proximal tibial metaphysis of 14-week-old mice was associated with increases in osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters, suggesting that kit signaling in mice also functions to regulate bone balance in adults.",
