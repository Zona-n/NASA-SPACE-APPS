            "text": "To sustain normal growth and allow rapid responses to environmental cues, plants alter the plasma membrane protein composition under different conditions presumably by regulation of delivery, stability, and internalization. Exocytosis is a conserved cellular process that delivers proteins and lipids to the plasma membrane or extracellular space in eukaryotes. The octameric exocyst complex contributes to exocytosis by tethering secretory vesicles to the correct site for membrane fusion; however, whether the exocyst complex acts universally for all secretory vesicle cargo or just for specialized subsets used during polarized growth and trafficking is currently unknown. In addition to its role in exocytosis, the exocyst complex is also known to participate in membrane recycling and autophagy. Using a previously identified small molecule inhibitor of the plant exocyst complex subunit EXO70A1, Endosidin2 (ES2), combined with a plasma membrane enrichment method and quantitative proteomic analysis, we examined the composition of plasma membrane proteins in the root of Arabidopsis seedlings, after inhibition of the ES2-targetted exocyst complex, and verified our findings by live imaging of GFP-tagged plasma membrane proteins in root epidermal cells. The abundance of 145 plasma membrane proteins was significantly reduced following short-term ES2 treatments and these likely represent candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking. Gene Ontology analysis showed that these proteins play diverse functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, membrane transport, and nutrient uptake. Additionally, we quantified the effect of ES2 on the spatial distribution of EXO70A1 with live-cell imaging. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex mediates constitutive dynamic transport of subsets of plasma membrane proteins during normal root growth.",

            "text": "The plant plasma membrane serves as a selective physical barrier between intracellular contents and the environment as well as a signaling platform for transmitting information from the exterior to induce cellular responses. Plasma membrane proteins can be classified as integral, lipid-anchored, and peripheral, based on the mode of association with the plasma membrane. Integral membrane proteins possess one to several transmembrane domains; lipid-anchored proteins associate with the plasma membrane through covalently attached fatty acids; peripheral membrane proteins associate with the plasma membrane through interactions with other membrane proteins, polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, or both. Several well-characterized plasma membrane-localized nutrient transporters, hormone receptors and transporters, and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes are known to undergo constitutive delivery and turnover. Proteomic analyses of plasma membrane proteins reveal that the composition is altered in response to biotic and abiotic stresses; however, the mechanisms for delivery of most of these plasma membrane proteins are not well characterized. Investigating how plants maintain the variety, abundance, and dynamics of plasma membrane proteins is essential for understanding cell growth, development, and response to stresses.",

            "text": "The conventional plant secretory pathway involves trafficking through the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi and post-Golgi vesicles to deliver lipids and proteins to the plasma membrane or extracellular space. The exocyst complex is a conserved octameric protein complex that primarily functions to mediate the tethering of secretory vesicles to the site of membrane fusion during the last step of exocytic trafficking. In addition, the exocyst complex also associates with the endocytic and autophagy machinery to modulate membrane recycling and autophagy. One plant exocyst subunit, EXO70A1, was recently characterized as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, through its interactions with anionic phospholipids. Loss of EXO70A1 function disrupts the recruitment of other exocyst subunits to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis root epidermal cells. Some known cargo proteins for plant exocyst complex-mediated trafficking include PIN auxin transporters, brassinosteroid receptor, and cellulose synthase complexes. However, it is not known what other plasma membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane through the exocyst complex. Whereas the half-life for turnover of plasma membrane proteins in mammalian cells varies from a few hours to a few days, we know much less about the mechanisms and dynamics of protein delivery to the plasma membrane in plants.",

            "text": "Previously, the small molecule Endosidin2 (ES2) was shown to target the EXO70A1 subunit of Arabidopsis exocyst complex and to inhibit exocytosis in plant and mammalian cells. Short-term ES2 treatment inhibits the transport of PIN-FORMED (PIN) family auxin transporter, PIN2, and the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1, to the plasma membrane, and also impairs the recycling of PIN2. In mammalian cells, ES2 treatment reduces the cell surface abundance of a membrane-anchored metalloproteinase MT2-MMP. In addition, given the role of the exocyst complex in autophagy, a recent study examined the consequences of ES2 treatment in autophagy events in mammalian cells, and found that a 24-h ES2 treatment resulted in decreased autophagy. To characterize changes in plasma membrane protein composition after short-term inhibition of the exocyst complex, and to identify additional proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex, we used ES2 to inhibit the exocyst complex. We enriched plasma membrane from roots of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with ES2 and DMSO solvent control and identified proteins using mass spectrometry analysis. We then performed quantitative and comparative proteomic analyses to identify plasma membrane proteins with altered abundance in ES2-treated samples and considered proteins with reduced abundance as candidate cargo proteins of exocyst-mediated trafficking in plants. We identified a subset of proteins with significantly reduced abundance at the plasma membrane after two hours of 40 μM ES2 treatment. Gene Ontology analysis of proteins with reduced abundance demonstrated enrichment for functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, membrane transport, hormone signaling, and stress responses. The abundance of many protein kinases and several uncharacterized proteins was reduced by ES2 treatment as well. Our results show that the exocyst complex mediates dynamic transport of a diverse set of proteins essential for plant growth and environmental adaptation.",

The seeds were well separated from each other in both horizontal and vertical orientations on 10 cm x 10 cm square petri plates. Plates were placed in vertical orientation so that the seedings grew on the surface of the agar media. The plants were grown in a growth chamber (Percival Scientific, Perry, IA, USA) under continuous light of 130 μmol m-2s-1 at 23°C. Six-day-old seedlings were removed from the agar plates and transferred to liquid ½ MS media with 1% (w/v) sucrose and 40 μM ES2 or 0.5% DMSO (mock). After two hours of treatment under light, the roots of the seedlings were quickly excised and transferred to the plasma membrane enrichment buffer. The process of plasma membrane enrichment followed exactly the published protocol. To evaluate the enrichment of plasma membrane proteins by Western blot assay, 12 μg of protein from each fraction was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and the presence of PIP2A-GFP, Sec12, and SYP41 was detected after transfer to PVDF membrane.

We further filtered the data by removing proteins with less than three detected values in the four replicates. To compare the data from different replicates, the ratio of protein abundance between differentially labeled proteins was transformed to log2 phase and further normalized by median subtraction and then analyzed by histogram ( Supplemental Figure S1 ).

The moderated t-test uses a hierarchical empirical Bayesian model to shrink the sample standard deviation estimates for each protein towards a pooled value. This stabilizes the t-statistics and increases the power of the test to detect true differences in protein abundance. Since multiple significance tests were performed, we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to bound the expected false-discovery rate at 10%. After the correction, 330 proteins had adjusted p-values less than 0.10. Thus, we can estimate that roughly 300 of the 330 proteins have log2 ratios significantly different from 0. Among these 330 proteins, 145 had reduced abundance ( Supplementary Tables S2 ,  S3 ) and 185 had increased abundance ( Supplementary Table S4 ) in the plasma membrane fraction of ES2-treated samples. To highlight the proteins with the most dramatic changes, the top twenty proteins with decreased and increased abundance were listed in  Tables 1 ,  2 , respectively. Because ES2 binds to the EXO70A1 subunit of the exocyst complex and inhibits its function, and because EXO70A1 serves as a landmark for exocyst complex recruitment to the plasma membrane, we expect that proteins with reduced abundance at the plasma membrane are candidate cargos of exocyst-mediated trafficking.",

PIN2 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.27, BRI1 had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.31, and FER had a mean log2 fold-change of -0.38. ( Supplementary Table S1 ). We quantified GFP-tagged protein fluorescence intensity on the plasma membrane and normalized by subtracting the mean background fluorescence intensity from a cytoplasmic compartment-free region ( Figure 2C ). The abundance of all three proteins at the plasma membrane region were significantly decreased after a 2-h ES2 treatment ( Figure 2D ). To further evaluate the change of abundance between the plasma membrane and entire cytoplasmic region, we also quantified the plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio as another indicator of plasma membrane protein abundance ( Figure 2E ). The plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratios for all three proteins were significantly reduced after a 2-h ES2 treatment compared to mock treatment ( Figure 2E ). Our analysis showed for the first time that the plasma membrane abundance of FER was decreased following ES2 treatment. As a negative control, we measured the abundance of PLASMA MEMBRANE INTRINSIC PROTEIN 2A (PIP2A), which was shown to have unaltered plasma membrane abundance after ES2 treatment in the proteomics analyses, with a mean log2 fold-change of 0.05 ( Supplementary Table S1 ). The plasma membrane abundance and plasma membrane / cytoplasm intensity ratio of PIP2A-GFP were not altered by ES2 treatment ( Figures 2D, E ).",

A 2-h, 40 µM ES2 treatment significantly reduced the abundance of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane on the outer periclinal face ( Figures 4B, D ), and disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the outer periclinal face when fluorescence intensity was expressed as a ratio with the cytosolic region ( Figure 4E ) or as a ratio with the other faces of the same cell ( Figure 4F ). However, when EXO70A1 at the other three faces of the plasma membrane visible in medial optical sections, including the inner periclinal face and the two anticlinal faces (green line in  Figure 4C ), was examined, the apparent abundance expressed as a ratio with cytosol was not affected by ES2 treatment ( Figure 4G ).

Some of these proteins possess transmembrane domains and are likely integral membrane proteins delivered to the plasma membrane by secretion. The candidate proteins without a predicted transmembrane domain could be associated with the plasma membrane through lipid anchors, through interaction with other membrane proteins, or by association with polar head groups of the lipid bilayer. These candidates of exocyst-mediated trafficking perform functions in cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress responses, membrane transport, nutrient transport, and protein phosphorylation. The dynamics of many hormone-signaling proteins are well characterized; however, the role of exocyst complex in regulating their trafficking awaits further study. The functional diversity of proteins that are transported through the exocyst complex is consistent with the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in plants deficient for the exocyst complex. Our results indicate that the plant exocyst complex plays essential roles for growth and adaptation by mediating constitutive transport of proteins with diverse functions to the plasma membrane.",

In our proteomics study, we detected a significant reduction in the abundance of cargo proteins, such as cellulose synthases, but did not detect a statistically significant reduction in the abundance of the exocyst complex subunits. The abundance of SCD complex components and candidate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane was also not affected by ES2 treatment. Previous live-cell imaging data reveal that exocyst subunits are polarized to the outer periclinal face of root epidermal cells and are disrupted by ES2 treatment or genetic disruption of EXO70A1, but not by genetic disruption of some SNARE proteins that physically interact with the exocyst complex. The plasma membrane enrichment reflects the overall abundance of each plasma membrane protein, but not their polarized distribution on a specific face of the plasma membrane. Results from live-cell imaging and our proteomics analyses indicated that ES2 treatment affected the polarized distribution of the exocyst complex in root epidermal cells but did not markedly affect its association with the plasma membrane. The lifetime of exocyst foci on the plasma membrane of root epidermal cells is around 10 s; however, inhibition of exocytosis by a 2-h Brefeldin A (BFA) treatment did not affect membrane localization of the exocyst complex. Thus, exocyst complex association with the plasma membrane may not depend on the other components of the exocytosis machinery.",

One future direction would be to quantify the localization of fluorescent-tagged SCD1/2 and SNAREs following ES2 treatment.

The composition of plasma membrane proteins changes upon salt stress, cold treatment, osmotic stress, immune signaling, nutrient deficiency and different growth stages of cultured cells. These proteomic studies show that the plasma membrane serves as a hub for cells to respond to environmental and growth cues. These studies further indicate that the vesicle trafficking machinery that facilitates the transport of these proteins is essential for plants to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous findings on the essential functions of plant exocyst complex in plant growth and immune responses support the hypothesis that the exocyst complex choreographs the dynamic change of specific proteins at the plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli and growth cues.",

We found that the abundance of some plant plasma membrane proteins was reduced by more than 50%, indicating that the half-time of turnover of these proteins is less than 2 h. We speculate that these proteins undergo fast delivery to the plasma membrane mediated by the exocyst complex and have a rapid turnover at the plasma membrane. There are other proteins that have lower abundance in ES2-treated samples but did not pass the statistical test. We believe these proteins have slower delivery and/or turnover rates at the plasma membrane. It is not well understood how plants control precise delivery of cargo proteins with different dynamics.",
