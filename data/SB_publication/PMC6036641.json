            "text": "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is associated with an increased risk of vertebral compression fracture. While bone is typically considered radiation-resistant, fractures frequently occur within the first year of SBRT. Our purpose was to determine if rapid deterioration of bone occurs in vertebrae post-irradiation (IR). Sixteen male rhesus macaques non-human primates (NHPs) were analyzed after total chest irradiation (IR) to a midplane dose of 10 Gy. Ages at IR varied from 45 – 134 mo. Computed tomography (CT) scans were taken 2 mo prior to IR and 2, 4, 6, and 8 mo post-IR for all animals. Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) were calculated longitudinally for thoracic (T)9, lumbar (L)2, and L4 vertebral bodies; gross morphology and histopathology were assessed per vertebra. Greater mortality (related to pulmonary toxicity) was noted in NHPs < 50 mo at time of IR vs NHPs > 50mo (p = 0.03). Animals older than 50 mo at IR lost Ct.Th in T9 by 2 mo post IR (p = 0.0009), which persisted to 8 mo. In contrast, no loss of Ct.Th was observed in vertebrae out-of-field (L2 and L4). Loss of BMD was observed by 4 mo post-IR for T9, and 6 mo post IR for L2 and L4 (p < 0.01). For NHPs younger than 50 mo at IR, both Ct.Th and BMD decreased in T9, L2, and L4 by 2 mo post-IR (p < 0.05). Regions that exhibited the greatest degree of cortical thinning as determined from CT scans also exhibited increased porosity histologically. Rapid loss of Ct.Th was observed after high dose chest IR in NHPs. Younger age at IR was associated with increased pneumonitis related mortality, as well as greater loss of both BMD and Ct.Th at both in-and out-of-field vertebrae. Older NHPs exhibited rapid loss of BMD and Ct.Th from in-field vertebrae, but only loss of BMD in out of field vertebrae. Bone is sensitive to high dose radiation, and rapid loss of bone structure and density could facilitate fractures.",

            "text": "Bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) are two of the primary metrics used to quantitatively describe bone structural changes and predict for fracture risk. The severity of RT-induced structural changes appears be impacted by both dose and age at irradiation. Wei et al. showed that doses as low as 5 Gy correlated with significant BMD loss (>20%) within just 4 months of irradiation (IR), and this effect was persistent at 9 month follow-up. While data regarding acute changes in BMD post-RT from clinical studies is limited, literature describing the acute changes in Ct.Th post-RT that could predispose to fracture are nearly absent. This is due to limitations in conventional computed tomography (CT) resolution of follow-up scans. Both decreased Ct.Th and BMD may predispose those at highest risk of VCF towards progression and collapse with symptoms. Early identification of those at highest risk for RT induced bone changes could potentially allow for better selection for prophylactic interventions. The effects of RT are difficult to study using clinical data alone due to numerous confounding factors. These factors include chemotherapy, steroids, reduced mobility, and direct bony infiltration by tumor, which are all detrimental to bone health.",

At time of IR the ages of the non-human primates (NHPs) ranged from 45 – 134 months old with a median of 57 months (young adults). Weights at time of IR ranged from 4.4–11.25 kg. These subjects were randomized into one of two treatment groups, either saline (n=7) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic “Hexyl”, a potential mitigator of radiation injury in lung (n=9, 0.125 mg/kg in a saline vehicle). Increased oxidative stress, with reduced cellular antioxidant defenses including SOD, is a putative mechanism for pathologic bone loss for many conditions, including estrogen deficiency at menopause. Thus this treatment is a potential mitigator for any radiation induced bone loss. Treatment was administered 24 hours following IR and continued twice daily for the duration of the study. The original primary focus of the study was not bone outcomes, but rather pneumonitis and the extent and/or prevention of pulmonary toxicity.",

Open, rectangular oblong fields (X-Y field size dimensions of 13.0cm (4.0cm, 9.0cm) × 12.0cm) were used without blocking of structures in the thorax with the field central axis placed at the xiphoid. Each field covered the superior aspect of the lungs and included the inferior lung to 4 cm below the xiphoid process. The lateral aspects of each lung and external skin surfaces were included within the radiation fields. The AP field included a 10 to 30 degree wedge (heel superior, angle determined from a computerized tomography (CT) scan of each animal) to compensate for the inferior-to-superior slope of the anterior chest wall, for improved dose homogeneity at midplane. Monitor units (dose delivery settings for the linear accelerator) were calculated assuming homogeneous tissue using measured animal AP diameters, grouping animals into three cohorts by their average AP dimensions.",

            "text": "As the use of high dose per fraction SBRT becomes more commonplace in modern practice, it is important to understand and quantify the impact of high dose RT on surrounding normal bone both inside and outside the treatment field. During thoracic and lumbar SBRT, bones are commonly exposed to relatively high RT doses. Standard fractionation regimens for lung tumors range from 10 to 18 Gy per fraction over a 3 to 5 fraction course. In some situations doses up to 34 Gy in a single fraction may be given to lung lesions. This unavoidably exposes nearby healthy bone to high doses of radiation per fraction as well. There are currently limited data concerning the acute consequences of high dose per fraction RT to bone. A majority of the pre-clinical literature available has been focused on the late outcomes involving rodent or cell models with fractions of 2 Gy or less. The limited clinical studies on this topic have shown that thoracic SBRT is associated with changes in bone structural quality directly impacting bone strength. Okoukoni et al. described significant cortical rib thinning in regions receiving ≥ 10 Gy after SBRT. Other studies have shown an association between thoracic SBRT and a higher incidence of late rib fractures (approaching 40%). Similarly, vertebral SBRT has been associated with increased progression of VCF. Post-mortem analysis of vertebral bodies exposed to SBRT have demonstrated bone fracture, cortical thinning, necrosis, and fibrosis. Although the animals treated in this study received radiation to their entire thoracic spine, extrapolation from these data could help shape our expectations of the types of bone changes we should anticipate following more localized treatments like SBRT. Such conformal therapies, can expose one to several vertebral bodies to high doses of radiation per fraction on the order of those used here.",

The scatter and leakage dose in the lumbar spine, outside the defined IR fields, for these animals was roughly 0.5 – 3% of the dose at the isocenter, which would correlate with doses of roughly 5 – 30 cGy (Figure 1). Doses on the order of 0.5 Gy to 2 Gy have been shown in vivo and in vitro to stimulate an early increase in the number and function of osteoclasts. In clinical studies, doses as low as 5 Gy have been associated with rapid local bone loss. This increased sensitivity of bone in the younger NHPs is also highlighted by the lack of changes in BMD at an even more distant site, the whole pelvis, which received no dose (Figure 1). Thus the dose threshold for bone damage is unclear, but possibly very low. Given that these animals reached a humane endpoint due to pneumonitis related toxicity, some of bone changes observed may have also been related to decreased physical activity.",

Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that RT directly damages osteoblasts and their precursors leading to impaired matrix production and lower BMD. Early up regulation of osteoclast activity leading to rapid bone loss post RT has been reported in rodent models. Radiation has been shown to cause an early and substantial increase the expression of pro-osteoclastogenic genes, including Rankl, Mcp1, and TNF-α. Young mice irradiated with an acute, large doses comparable to the chest dose in this study (7.25 and 8.0 Gy) exhibited rapid loss of bone coincident with increased systemic biomarkers of TRAP5b, a circulating biomarker for osteoclast activity. Additionally, prophylactic use of osteoclast inhibitors have been shown to decrease acute RT induced bone loss in rodents. Moreover, exposure of young mice to high dose radiation of 7.25 Gy has been shown to reduce circulating biomarkers of bone formation and osteoblast activity, including sclerostin and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide. Therefore it is likely that the rapid bone loss seen here is facilitated by at least a contribution from both osteoclasts and osteoblasts, though rapid bone loss is likely a feature of elevated osteoclast activity.",

Our data highlights the significance of early radiation induced bone changes and their dependence on both dose and skeletal maturity. Additionally, younger age at IR was associated with greater sensitivity to radiation. These findings should be confirmed on future human trials, however they do present interesting implications for clinical practice, as they illustrate that bone is a radiosensitive tissue. Patients with underlying diagnoses such as osteoporosis or pre-existing VCF may be at increased risk of progression or development of fractures. Avoidance of normal bone in radiation planning may decrease rates of later fractures. Importantly, the rapid rate of bone loss suggests an early increase in osteoclast activity, which is consistent with preclinical studies. If such radiation induced changes are primarily due to an early up regulation of osteoclastic activity, then the use of osteoclast inhibitory therapies may provide some degree of bone radioprotection, and identifies the osteoclast as a prime target for therapeutics to prevent the debilitating radiation therapy-induced fractures in cancer patients. Additionally, the cortical thickness dose mapping approach for measuring subacute bone loss across time as applied in this NHP model can be translated and clinically identify those patients at highest risk for skeletal complications following SBRT.",
