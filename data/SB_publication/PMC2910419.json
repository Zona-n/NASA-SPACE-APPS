            "text": "The present study examined the morphological development of the otolith vestibular receptors in quail. Here we describe epithelial growth, hair cell density, stereocilia polarization, and afferent nerve innervation during development. The otolith maculae epithelial areas increased exponentially throughout embryonic development reaching asymptotic values near post-hatch day P7. Increases in hair cell density were dependent upon macular location; striolar hair cells developed first followed by hair cells in extrastriola regions. Stereocilia polarization was initiated early, with defining reversal zones forming at E8. Less than half of all immature hair cells observed had non-polarized internal kinocilia with the remaining exhibiting planar polarity. Immunohistochemistry and neural tracing techniques were employed to examine the shape and location of the striolar regions. Initial innervation of the maculae was by small fibers with terminal growth cones at E6, followed by collateral branches with apparent bouton terminals at E8. Calyceal terminal formation began at E10, however no mature calyces were observed until E12, when all fibers appeared to be dimorphs. Calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells did not develop until E14. Finally, the topographic organization of afferent macular innervation in the adult quail utricle was quantified. Calyx and dimorph afferents were primarily confined to the striolar regions, while bouton fibers were located in the extrastriola and type II band. Calyx fibers were the least complex, followed by dimorph units. Bouton fibers had large innervation fields, with arborous branches and many terminal boutons.",

            "text": "The vestibular otolith receptors have evolved to detect linear motion and head position with respect to gravity. These are essential functions, about which all coordinated and reflexive movements, as well as spatial orientation and navigation through space depend. However, little is known about otolith system development. Most studies have focused upon either stereocilia, otoconia formation, or the molecular genetics underlying macular formation and hair cell fate. Here, we performed a comprehensive morphological examination of otolith receptor formation and maturation into adulthood. These studies were conducted in quail, a non-altricial species, where a rapid embryogenesis (16 days incubation) of a functional vestibular system must occur so that upon hatching, regulation of posture, gaze, and spatial orientation is intact.",

            "text": "Otolith receptors in amniotes contain two types of hair cells and three afferent types with distinct morphological innervation patterns. Type I hair cells are innervated by an enclosing calyceal terminal while type II hair cells are innervated by bouton terminals. The different hair cell types are not heterogeneous throughout the maculae, but instead exhibit regional distributions that have been characterized in mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds. In birds, a type I hair cell rich zone lies within a unique area, termed the “striola”, which also differs in receptor cell density and otoconia formation. Outside the striola, lies the extrastriola, which is populated primarily by type II hair cells in birds. Currently, little information exists regarding how the two cell types become regionally distributed during development.",

The eccentric position of the kinocilium defines a morphological polarization that also determines the cellular response amplitude and spatial tuning. Across the epithelium, hair cell polarizations are topographically organized, with an imaginary line running through the epithelium about which stereocilia are oppositely directed. The mechanisms responsible for morphological polarization (also termed planar cell polarity) have been well studied, particularly in auditory hair cells. However, questions remain as to how the broader organization of the topographic map in the otolith organs is developed.",

Macular innervation has been thoroughly examined only in chinchillas and pigeons, where three fiber classes were identified. Calyx afferents contain only calyceal terminals to innervate type I hair cells. Bouton afferents contain en passant and boutons terminaux to innervate only type II hair cells. Dimorph afferents innervate both type I and II hair cells, with calyceal and bouton terminals. These three afferent types also exhibit specific regional distributions. In pigeons, calyx and dimorph afferents are exclusive to the striola region in the utricular macula but are spread wider into the extrastriola epithelium in the saccule. In contrast, bouton afferents are exclusively located in the extrastriola regions and a unique band of type II cells that flanks the reversal line of the utricle. Less is known regarding the development of macular afferent innervation. reported that bouton afferents develop in chicks before calyceal bearing afferents, but their study did not address the formation of regional differences in macular innervation.",

Images for E6-E10 maculae were taken at 9000×, while images of E12-adult maculae were taken at 5000x. The micrographs for each macula were reconstructed as a montage and the planar polarity for each hair cell in the view was measured. For better visualization of stereocilia bundles (see Fig. 3B), some maculae were sonicated to shear the bundles from the apical surface of the cell. Each cell’s polarization was determined by drawing a vector from the shortest stereocilia to the kinocilium. The vector angle was measured using a compass rosette overlaid on the receptor epithelium (see Fig. 3A). In the utricular macula, the anterior pole was designated as 0°, the medial edge direction was designated as 90°, and the lateral edge as 270°. For saccular maculae, the superior edge was set at 90°, the inferior edge was oriented to 270°. Normalized distances were measured with the lateral edge (utricles) or superior edge (saccules) of the epithelium = 0μm. In addition, the polarization of cells across the entire macular surface was mapped. First, SEM images (5000x) were serially obtained across the epithelial surface. Arrows were drawn on the surface outline indicating the planar polarity of cells within each of the immediate high magnification views, until the entire epithelium was mapped.",

Different growth rates were observed for the two otolith organs, with an overall larger receptor epithelium growing faster for the utricle as compared to the saccule. After hatching, the saccular macula underwent almost no growth, while the utricular macula continued to increase in size until reaching asymptotic levels by P7. The rates of growth for both the utricular and saccular maculae followed a sigmoidal function (Fig. 1A), with significantly different slopes (1.8 – utricle; 1.3 - saccule).

For example, at E6 orientation angles were widely distributed (regression r2 values of 0.15), with neighboring cells having polarities that could differ by as much as 180 degrees (Fig. 4A, E). Most utricular hair cells located in the lateral portion of the macula (distance values near 0.0) were initially oriented toward the anterior (0o, or 360o) to lateral (270o) edges of the macula. An incremental change in bundle orientation from anterior to lateral to posterior (Fig 4A) (increase in normalized distance) was observed for cells located in the lateral-to-medial dimension of the utricular macula. Further, at E6 a few cells in the lateral utricular macula had reversed their orientation to be directed toward the medial edge (90° angles), thus marking the initiation of the reversal zone. Similar orientations were observed for the E6 saccular macula (Fig. 4E). By E7 however, hair cells were beginning to orient themselves in a pattern that approximated that of the adult (regression variance of r2 = 0.49; Fig. 4B). As shown in Figures 3C & E, a reversal line of opposing hair cell polarity ran along the lateral and anterior edges of the adult utricular macula. However, on the medial edge, hair cells were directed in an anti-parallel organization. This pattern was reflected in the polarization angle plots of Figure 4D, where the opposing reversal line was observed at a normalized distance of 0.2 and the anti-parallel zone at a distance of 0.9. By E8, the utricular polarizations were equal to that of the adult. In the saccular macula, the maturation was delayed compared to the utricle. First, in the adult saccule, a single C-shaped reversal line was observed, as shown in Figures 3D & F. The saccular counting frame bisected the reversal line at normalized distances of approximately 0.25 and 0.8 in the adult (Fig. 4H). At E7 (Fig. 4F), saccular hair cells in these zones were beginning to exhibit bundle orientations more similar to the mature patterns, with even less variation observed at E8 (r2 = 0.90). By E10 (r2 = 0.92), the polarization angles for utricular hair cells were not different from that observed in the adult (r2 = 0.94, Fig. 4D). In the saccular macula, a final mature pattern (r2 = 0.94; Fig. 4H) was not complete until E12 (r2 = 0.93).",

Recently, observed that type I hair cells in turtles could be distinguished by their stereocilia bundles, having significantly more numerous and shorter cilia than type II hair cells. Although quantitative analyses of stereocilia formation and confirmation of cell type were outside the scope of the present investigation, we none-the-less applied a similar metric to adult quail in an attempt to differentiate type I and type II hair cell location across the macular surfaces. Surprisingly, a fairly distinct border between zones containing putative type I hair cells (short stereocilia, Fig. 3G) and zones containing only putative type II hair cells (long stereocilia, Fig. 3H) was observed. As shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the striolar regions (solid white lines) were regionally restricted and could be characterized as the primary zones that contained putative type I cells. Mixed in with these type I hair cells, were cells with longer and fewer stereocilia (putative type II cells), although much less numerous. In contrast, extrastriola regions contained only putative type II hair cells. These demarcations were next applied to embryonic maculae in order to determine at what point in development the striolar regions becomes defined. We observed that the first striolar margins formed at E10. The stereocilia bundles of most hair cells in E10 and younger embryos appeared similar to those of putative type II cells and varied little across the sensory epithelia, including areas that would later develop into the striolar region. As described in more detail below, it appears that before E10 – E12, no mature type I hair cell phenotype is present in the maculae. However, after E12, type I hair cells developed to populate the striolar regions and the regional differences in stereocilia bundle morphology became more defined.",

Only 6 - 12% out of 1382 cells counted were immature, with fewer kinocilia being internal (Fig. 5E-F). By adulthood, less than 1% of all observable hair bundles (n = 1432) were considered to be immature. The maturation of hair cells followed an exponential time course for both maculae (Fig. 5E). Consequently, as the number of immature hair cells decreased, the percentage of cells with external kinocilia increased (Fig. 5F). In terms of epithelial location, during early embryogenesis most immature bundles were found in the future striolar region (normalized distance 0.2 – 0.5), as shown for the utricular macula in Figure 5F. This region corresponds to that exhibiting the largest increase in cell proliferation (Fig 1B). By E10 however, most immature bundles were located in the extrastriolar regions of both maculae (Fig. 5G).",

Macular afferents were examined in at least four animals for each developmental time point between E6 – E15, P7 and adult. In addition to neural tracers, nerve fibers and calyx afferent terminals were labeled with an antibody against class III β-tubulin (Tuj1). Tuj1 is a neuron specific marker that has been well characterized for visualization properties in vestibular tissue. As shown in Figure 6, afferent innervation of the vestibular sensory epithelia began early, coincident with the receptor hair cell differentiation. At E6, a number of small nerve fibers had penetrated the receptor epithelium (Fig. 6A – C). Most of these early developing fibers were characterized by either elongated (Fig. 6A) or elliptical (Fig. 6B) growth cones that coursed toward the apical epithelial surface with few branch points or arborizations. These growing fibers appeared to be targeting differentiated receptor cells at the apical portions of the epithelium. By E8, nerve fibers demonstrated terminal swellings on or near developing hair cells (Fig. 6D-E) with more numerous arborizations (Fig. 6F). At E10, cup-shaped proto-calyceal terminals were first observed to be forming around the basolateral area of some hair cells (Fig. 6G-I). By E12, calyceal terminals were observed that encapsulated many presumptive type I hair cells, while others continued to form (Fig. 6J-L). Most of these fibers contained both calyceal terminals and additional branches with bouton terminals or growth cones, indicative of dimorph type afferents. In whole mount preparations viewed from the apical surface, the striolar region was identifiable from large clusters of calyceal terminals. These calyces were formed into discrete structures surrounding one or several presumptive type I hair cells (Fig. 6L). At E14, a number of mature calyceal terminals were observed, with endings that fully enveloped hair cells up to their apical surface (Fig. 6M - N). Many of these calyceal terminals enveloped multiple type I hair cells and had no observable branch fibers. Thus, at this point in development, true calyx fibers were first observed in abundance. In addition, at E14, the 4 - 6 cell wide type II band, devoid of type I cells, had formed and encompassed the reversal line in the striola (Fig. 6O).",

However their absence during development does not preclude type I cell formation. Thus, a more specific type I hair cell marker was also sought. Based upon previous reports that suggested that the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin could be exclusively expressed in type I hair cells, we used a tenascin antibody in an attempt to identify the formation of type I hair cells in embryonic and adult maculae. First, the localization of tenascin in type I hair cells was examined in adult quail maculae by double labeling with both β-tubulin (green) and tenascin (red) antibodies, as shown in Figure 7 of an adult utricle. β-tubulin was expressed throughout the calyceal terminal and in portions of the afferent fibers (Fig. 7A). Tenascin, in contrast, was expressed in the outer portion of the type I hair cell membrane, forming distinct rings when viewed from the surface at different focal planes (Fig. 7B). When merged (Fig. 7C), the tenascin expression was confined within the larger calyceal structures, suggesting again that tenascin is located in hair cell specific proteins and not in the innervating calyceal terminal. In Figure 7D - F, a single image from the lateral region of a sectioned P7 utricle has been double labeled. Here, calyceal terminals were clearly labeled with β-tubulin, while the tenascin expression was observed in the hair cell outer membrane, the basement membrane, and punctate label in innervating afferent fibers of the sensory epithelium (Fig. 7E). We next examined tenascin expression in embryonic maculae and found that labeling of any sort (except the basement membrane) was extremely weak in early embryos (E6 – E8). In later stage embryonic maculae (E10 – E12), tenascin could only be found in punctate formations in hair cells. However, by E14, tenascin expression was observed to be similar to that shown for P7 and adult maculae.",

A few dimorph afferents also had terminal branch fields that innervated the type II band and the striolar region (Fig. 8G). Dimorph axon diameters were significantly smaller than the calyx afferents (Table 1), varying between 1.0 – 3.2 μm with a mean value of 2.4μm (SD±0.6).

This was true even in macular regions that would later be densely populated by type I hair cells. Second, how do the directional polarization maps develop? We observed that planar cell polarity patterns migrate through several days of embryogenesis to reach an adult topographic form. Third, how do the three afferent types develop into regional distributions across the macula? We found that bouton afferents develop first.

The development of planar cell polarity in hair cells has been well described for the auditory system ( review), but less so for the vestibular system. Here, the polarization maps for both maculae in adult quail were established. Similar to many vertebrates, hair cell polarizations are directed toward the reversal line in the utricle, but away from the reversal line in the saccule. In birds, the reversal line is located in the striola region, toward the lateral and anterior edges of the epithelium, with an anti-parallel arrangement observed along the medial extrastriola border. In mammals, the macular reversal zones are centrally located, with no region of anti-parallel organization shown to date. In contrast to the utricle, the quail saccule had a C-shaped reversal zone, similar to that seen in cormorants.

Recently, several genes encoding adherence proteins (e.g., Flamingo, Frizzled, Scribble, Van Gogh) have been shown to be necessary for determining planar polarity in vestibular hair cells.

The planar polarities for hair cells were not randomly distributed, but instead established orientations that migrated as development progressed. By E10, the polarization maps were fully formed to an adult pattern in the utricle, complete with reversal zones, while the saccular map lagged behind by approximately one developmental day. The cues that regulate the map formation are unknown. Recent studies have suggested that signaling morphogens in the cochlea (where all hair cells have similar orientations) could produce a diffusion gradient across the epithelium to direct cellular polarity. However, in the vestibular maculae, hair cells have regional variations in morphological polarization and even different types of reversal zones, so multiple morphogens working in directional cascades would seem to be necessary. Recently, reported that the transcription factor GATA3 is expressed selectively beneath the perpendicular reversal zones in the chick utricle and lagena, but is absent in the oppositely directed reversal zone of the saccule. These authors suggest that GATA3 may induce morphogens that could direct a perpendicular reversal zone. They also suggest that it is possible that GATA3 plays a role in development of the unique type II band of hair cells in the utricle and lagena that is not present in the saccule. In the end, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying development of hair cell polarization in the vestibular receptor organs.",

            "text": "It is known that in chicks and mice, at E5 and E13.5 respectively, vestibular hair cells begin to differentiate and migrate toward the epithelial surface early in development,; before nerve fiber penetration into the sensory epithelium occurs. In quail, the initial afferent fibers entering the maculae appeared to be directed toward developing hair cells, consistent with the suggestion that hair cells supply chemical guidance cues to direct fiber growth. In fact, it has been reported that hair cells release neurotrophins, including BDNF and NT3, which are known to bind to specific afferent receptors (TrkB and TrkC, respectively) to direct growing fibers toward their targets. In quail, bouton terminals were observed early in development, largely in close approximation to hair cells, similar to findings reported for chick embryos. No developing calyceal terminals were observed until later in development, around E10. These early calyceal terminals consisted of cup shaped endings at the hair cell base, which were later followed by terminal finger-like projections that extended along the sides of the hair cell towards the apex. Similar descriptions for calyceal formation have been reported for chick maculae. Most of these initial proto-calyceal terminals were formed on fibers with extant branching fiber segments which contained terminal boutons. It appears certain that calyceal terminals develop on existing bouton fibers, and thereby trans-differentiate into dimorph afferents at E10 – E12. Many of these fibers are expected to remain dimorph afferents. However, it was not until late in embryonic development, at E14, that isolated calyx afferents were first observed. Since bouton fibers appear to trans-differentiate into dimorph units, it is also likely that some fraction of the dimorph fibers become induced (by as yet unknown factors) to shed their small branch segments with bouton endings and trans-differentiate into calyx afferents innervating only type I hair cells. We have recently proposed that a similar trans-differentiation process occurs during regenerative re-innervation of the vestibular epithelia. Alternatively, it is possible that new afferent fibers destined to form calyx innervations grow into the epithelium late in development. More research is needed to answer the question. As a comparison, calyceal terminal formation begins essentially at birth in rodents and continues for several post-natal weeks. However, many mammalian type I hair cells become differentiated prior to calyceal formation, again suggesting that morphogenic factors give direct signaling cues for calyceal terminal development.",

            "text": "At the terminal phase of development, bouton, dimorph, and calyx afferents were all observed in quail maculae, similar to other amniote vertebrates. In the utricle, calyceal bearing afferents were principally located in the striola while bouton afferents innervated the extrastriola and type II band, similar to the organization reported for pigeons. In both species, calyceal bearing afferents are more broadly distributed throughout the saccular macula. As a comparison, mammalian and turtle calyx afferents are restricted to a narrow striolar region, while in mammals dimorph afferents are found broadly throughout the epithelium. Bouton afferents are exclusively located in the mammalian extrastriolar region. We have previously suggested that type I hair cells and calyceal terminals in otolith receptors may be increasing in numbers through selective adaptation. For example, Type I hair cells are not present in fish or amphibians, but first appear in reptiles and birds in limited numbers. The number of type I hair cells and calyceal terminals increases in mammals where the highest concentrations have been observed.",

            "text": "In quail, calyx afferents had the largest diameter axons, with short unbranched fibers that terminated in large calyceal terminals. On average, calyces contained 4 type I hair cells, fewer than the value of 7 for pigeons, but more than the 1 – 3 hair cells generally observed in mammalian calyces. Quail dimorph afferents were the most diverse in terms of innervation. Their parent axons were smaller than calyx fibers, yet their innervation patterns were more complex with multi-branched fibers that innervated a larger area of the utricular epithelium. There were fewer type I hair cells per calyceal terminal in dimorphs (average of 2) than calyx afferents. A similar diversity in pigeon utricular dimorph afferents was reported, except that pigeon dimorphs (like calyx afferents) were typically larger and more complex than those of quail. In chinchillas, dimorph fibers were more widely spread throughout the macular epithelium than observed in birds. Finally, quail bouton afferents had the smallest diameter axons of all fiber types, yet they were the most complex with the most branches, the largest arborization profiles, and the largest innervation areas. For comparison, the average number of 35 bouton terminals in quail afferents was identical to the mean value of 35 reported for chinchillas, but less than the value of 60 for pigeons or nearly 150 for frogs (where only type II hair cells exist).",

            "text": "Unfortunately, there remains a paucity of data relating differences in afferent physiological responsiveness to the striking differences in fiber innervation pattern. What is known is that fibers innervating the central maculae in chinchillas, where the calyx afferents are located, have the most irregular discharge rates, the highest sensitivities, and the most advanced phase values to linear acceleration as compared to extrastriola innervating afferents. In pigeons, we previously reported that utricular afferents exhibit some of the highest sensitivities to linear acceleration of any species examined to date. These fibers also responded to high frequency stimuli with advanced phase values, but whether these fibers had calyceal terminals or not is unknown. No data currently exist for quail. To the best of our knowledge, neural recordings of developing vestibular afferents during embryogenesis have not been performed in any species. Still, otolith receptors must begin functioning early in many birds as vestibular evoked potentials could be elicited using linear acceleration in E19 chick embryos. Further, upon hatching, quail begin to forage and feed themselves, so a functioning vestibular system must exist. During development, it would appear that bouton afferents become responsive first, followed later by calyceal bearing fibers. Questions regarding development sequences of physiological responses and vestibular mediated behaviors remain the subject of future investigations. Certainly, differences in hair cell organization and innervation morphology throughout the maculae serve to provide important functional distinctions.",
