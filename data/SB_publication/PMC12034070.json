One of the stimuli most frequently driven through resistance training is increasing muscle hypertrophy. Muscle hypertrophy is viewed as a foundational performance factor as the force a muscle can create is proportional to the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) of that muscle. Resistance training has been shown to have a positive effect on increasing PCSA of muscles. A progressive training stimulus capable of producing muscle hypertrophy can still be achieved by manipulating program variables other than load. Increasing PCSA through muscle hypertrophy is a foundational performance precursor to the expression of maximal strength and power. Expression of maximal strength and power is heavily influenced by both inter- and intramuscular coordination as well as the specificity of the training in which the athlete participates. There may be no greater modifiable variable in injury prevention and rehabilitation than improving the overall strength and hypertrophy of an athlete, and BFRT provides practitioners with a valuable tool to improve muscular strength and foster hypertrophy.",

Metabolic stress is the by-product of metabolites produced through anerobic glycolysis when engaging in glycolytic training. These metabolites include lactate, hydrogen ions, inorganic phosphate, and creatine. This metabolite accumulation is thought to be a mediator of the hypertrophic response specific to resistance training. Exercise stress creates a hypoxic environment that decreases pH while increasing concentrations of hydrogen ions, CO2, lactate, calcium, and reactive oxygen species. This combination results in increasing the release of myokines and cellular mechanotransduction to accommodate to cell swelling during loaded exercise, thereby furthering an increase in systemic anabolic signaling. Muscle damage in the form of the deformation of the myofibrils through training produces an acute inflammatory response where, once the damage is perceived by the body, there is a hormonal response of various growth factors, leading to satellite cell proliferation, tissue repair, and muscle growth. Mechanical tension is produced by force generation and stretching the muscle in a lengthened position, which increases as the load increases, resulting in a rise of type II muscle fiber recruitment to execute the task.",

Conventionally, the pathway to improving hypertrophy is by using loads >60% of the 1-repetition max (1RM) with 8 to 12 repetitions per set, or strength 80% to 100% of 1RM with 1 to 5 repetitions per set. However, muscle hypertrophy and activation of type II muscle fibers have been shown to be equally achieved across a variety of loading parameters, such as 30% to 80% of 1RM with a consistent theme of training to volitional fatigue. Athletes who are load compromised secondary to structural or functional constraints may not tolerate heavy loads well and may need to use an alternative mode of exercise to elicit metabolic stress, muscle damage, and mechanical tension to stimulate the appropriate skeletal muscle response to resistance exercise and induce anabolism. BFRT is a modality that is capable of achieving these results in load-compromised individuals.",

It is important to note that there is a summation of type II muscle fibers both proximal and distal to the cuff when BFRT is utilized. The rationale for the increase in muscle activation proximal to the placement of the cuff is recruitment of more proximal synergistic muscles later in the set when the distally occluded muscles are approaching volitional fatigue.

This cell swelling distal to the cuff is thought to further propagate intracellular hypoxia, leading to anabolic and inflammatory signaling mechanisms. Additionally, there is an increase in systemic anabolic signaling from the distal metabolite accumulation and proximally via downstream fatigue of the proximal musculature to accommodate for the workload. The confluence of both the proximal and distal response to occlusion while exercising leads to a local and systemic anabolic signaling of an increase in growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, vascular endothelial growth factor, myogenic stem cells, and muscle protein synthesis via mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1–mediated anabolism. Insulin-like growth factor 1 plays a vital role in muscle hypertrophy by facilitating muscle protein synthesis through satellite cell proliferation and suppressing myostatin, which is a known negative regulator of muscle and bone anabolism. Suppressed anabolic signaling has been shown to be present in individuals who may be inactive secondary to being load compromised or immobilized, which can contribute to a further decline in muscle mass. PCSA is proportional to the force-generating capacity of the muscle, and disuse can lead to atrophy, which can reduce the PCSA of a muscle. Muscle hypertrophy is a foundational performance factor in the expression of strength and power. In rehabilitation and sports performance, atrophy must be mitigated and hypertrophy prioritized to successfully improve athletic strength, power, and endurance. The mechanisms produced using BFRT can be extremely useful in facilitating this process.",

Potential adverse side effects to BFRT include but are not limited to pain or discomfort, delayed-onset muscle soreness, cardiac stress, numbness or nerve injury, bruising or ischemic injury, dizziness, fainting, muscle damage, thrombus formation, and rhabdomyolysis. Clinical prediction rules, such as the Wells criteria, can be used to help practitioners assess the probability of venous thromboembolism in at-risk individuals. Nascimento et al. created a comprehensive screening tool that provides practitioners with a risk stratification specific to the use of BFRT.

The placement of the cuff should be as proximal on the working limb as possible to target the whole muscle group, allow for a full range of motion during exercise, and mitigate any risk of superficial nerve compression. The use of a barrier between the skin and the cuff has also been recommended to mitigate any risk of superficial skin breakdown secondary to friction. Before beginning BFRT, it is imperative to standardize limb occlusion pressure (LOP) specific to both the individual using the device and the position in which they will be exercising. Factors influencing LOP are cuff width, cuff material, cuff shape, limb circumference, limb characteristics, resting blood pressure, limb temperature, and position of the individual. Use of a wider BFRT cuff has been shown to require lower pressure required to occlude the limb and produce fewer subjective reports of local discomfort.",

Distal pulses must always be palpated when identifying LOP regardless of the type of equipment being used. In any training intervention, reproducibility and safety are of the utmost importance, and BFRT is no exception. The gold standard is the use of a personalized tourniquet system with dynamic capabilities that can maintain and regulate a specified LOP pressure based on pressure fluctuations during movement.

LL BFRT has been shown to elicit changes in strength and hypertrophy both proximal and distal to the cuff in the UE. Changes in strength and hypertrophy proximal to the cuff are thought to occur due to training to volitional fatigue, bringing about synergistic involvement of the proximal muscle groups. LL BFRT in the UE appears to provide a greater increase in muscle strength and size than low-load resistance training alone. Utilizing LL BFRT in individuals with a load-compromised UE appears to be an appropriate training stimulus to improve strength and hypertrophy. Further research in the area of BFRT and its effects on the UE can be of benefit as there is variance in the literature, particularly in regard to protocol standardization. Additionally, it is worth noting that there is a scarcity of studies on the use of BFRT in healthy tendons and in the management of tendon pathology for both the UE and LE.

Blood flow restriction (BFR) with AE has demonstrated significant improvements in aerobic capacity (AC) when compared to low- to moderate-intensity aerobic exercise without BFR. When comparing high-intensity (>90% of VO2 max) AE with and without BFRT, there is minimal difference in improvement in AC. However, there is significant improvement in anaerobic capacity and power without compromising maximal AC, suggesting the improvements in BFRT training with high-intensity AE are muscular rather than cardiovascular in nature.
