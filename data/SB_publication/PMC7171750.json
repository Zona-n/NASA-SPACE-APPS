In 2016, 80% of NID deaths were due to cancers, cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, with the remaining 20% due to immune disorders, digestive issues, genitourinary disease, and oral or dental conditions. The collection of bacteria and less dominant micro-organisms that inhabit our body is termed the human microbiome and plays an integral role in maintaining health. Changes in the composition of one’s microbiome may promote the development of the aforementioned NIDs, as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer have different bacterial communities than healthy individuals. While it is still unclear whether these microbial differences are a consequence or a cause of disease, there is evidence in favor of the latter, as healthy animals transplanted with feces from those with obesity, colitis, or colorectal cancer then go on to develop disease.",

The impact of EBV shedding, for example, on crew health could be limited to the minor symptoms of infection to an increased risk of lymphoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, and mononucleosis. The role of the oral microbiome in viral reactivation during spaceflight has not yet been studied, but may be a key factor in this phenomenon. Its role may be indirect, through immune modulation or directly, through bacterial-viral interactions. Studies have shown that short-chain fatty acids produced by oral bacteria induce reactivation of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), and EBV, by activating viral promotors and/or causing epigenetic modifications in the inserted viral genome.",

In relation to health and disease, high bacterial richness in the saliva has been associated with poor oral health (decayed teeth, periodontitis, and poor oral hygiene), and in the vagina, high bacterial diversity has been linked to bacterial vaginosis. It is unknown how increased bacterial richness may promote EBV reactivation and/or replication, but one possibility is that certain strains, that may be beneficial in maintaining latency and/or curbing viral growth, become diluted in the sample (i.e., relative abundance decreases) and thus do not have as profound an impact on the host. Another hypothesis could be that the additional strains not present in virus negative samples produce metabolites that (i) induce reactivation, (ii) directly interact with the viral particle to increase propagation, and/or (iii) minimize the ability of the host to properly clear viral particles. To note, there is the possibility that weakening of the astronauts’ immune response during spaceflight facilitates EBV reactivation and the growth of bacterial strains that otherwise would be controlled by the immune response, remaining undetected. While there was a correlation between EBV and the microbiome, none existed for HSV-1.

H2S has been shown to be protective against pathogenic RNA viruses by decreasing the expression of viral proteins and mRNA during the early stages of replication, though no studies have been published regarding its protective capacity against DNA viruses. Veillonella, one of the major H2S producers in the oral cavity, had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher relative abundance in samples that came from subjects that never had a reactivation episode compared to samples that were negative for virus but came from subjects that had a reactivation episode at least once (Figure S4A). It was also the most predictive organism, as assessed by random forests, for these groups (Figure S4C). This raises the question as to whether Veillonella or specifically H2S, which is also produced by all three Lachnoanaerobaculum species, could play a role in maintaining viral latency. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a potent inducer of latent viral proteins and shown to induce reactivation of EBV, Karposi’s sarcoma virus, and HIV. In a study involving wild-type and H2S deficient strains of E.coli, H2O2 degradation in the cell was severely hampered in the mutant strains compared to the wild-type (H2S proficient) strains. H2S has the ability to antagonize H2O2 effects on the host, scavenge reactive oxygen species, and induce the expression of catalases and peroxidases, all leading to lower amounts of H2O2 in the host.",

Gracilibacteria (a.k.a. GN02) is a candidate phylum, meaning that no cultured representatives have been found but it is known to exist through 16S rRNA amplicon or shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses. It was first described in a study of the Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat and since then at least 13 clones have been detected from the human oral cavity. In 2013, single cell genomics was performed on 2 clones from this candidate phylum and a re-coding of the opal stop codon UGA for glycine was discovered. Abiotrophia, on the other hand, is more dominant in the oral cavity than Gracilibacteria, and one species, A. defectiva, is most known for its role in infective endocarditis. There is no information available, as yet, on how these two taxa could promote viral reactivation and/or replication.",

Alpha diversity (richness, Shannon’s diversity, phylogenetic diversity) changed during flight but beta diversity (differences between samples based on what is there and their abundances) did not. While there were no population level differences as a result of spaceflight, 5 out of the 10 subjects did have distinct microbial communities pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. It is interesting to note that for the five subjects that had a significant difference in their microbiome, this was their first space mission, while the five subjects that did not have microbiome differences, had previously flown to the ISS. This may suggest that a person’s microbiome is able to adapt to spaceflight and is less recalcitrant to microbiome effects during spaceflight upon re-exposure. For those five subjects whose microbiome was not impacted by flight, it was evident that their post-flight samples were never similar to the pre-flight samples, even after 6 months, suggesting that the act of flying to the ISS causes either an irreversible change in the oral microbiome or a change that takes longer than 6 months to rebound. Further studies would need to be done to examine the consequence of these changes on the long-term health of the astronaut. Since each subject had different microbes influencing the microbial communities, a focus on a personalized astronaut microbiome to maintain health and prevent disease would be necessary.",

The samples were collected by the astronauts themselves by placing a synthetic polymer swab (Salimetrics LLC, State College, PA) in one’s mouth and swirling it around for 2–3 min until saturation. The samples were stored at − 80 °C until ready to process.

For alpha diversity of Streptococcus ASVs, the conditions were as followed: − m 1000, − x 50000, − s 4000, and − n 1. The data generated in QIIME was plotted and visualized in Prism (v.7). Significance between pre-flight, flight, and post-flight samples was measured using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, paired design, followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg multiple comparison post-hoc test in Prism. Linear regression analyses were also performed which produced the same results as the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significance was defined as P < 0.05.",
