Subclustering within ECs, SMCs and fibroblasts revealed specialized subsets engaged in processes such as EndoMT and cell cycle checkpoint regulation.

            "text": "With the increasing frequency of long-duration spaceflights, astronauts are confronted with a myriad of harsh conditions, including radiation, microgravity and circadian rhythm disruptions. These factors precipitate a cascade of cardiovascular changes, initially characterized by fluid shifts from the lower limbs to the head. Subsequent phenomena include decreased circulatory blood volume, diminished diastolic arterial pressure, reduced left ventricular dimensions, and post-flight orthostatic intolerance. Furthermore, there is evidence of accelerated physiological aging in the CA, which appears to be reversible. The structural and functional vascular deconditioning observed in spaceflight has been attributed to alterations in the arterial wall. Studies have documented increased arterial stiffness and reduced compliance in the CA following 6 months of spaceflight, along with increased intima-media thickness in both CA and FA. Several molecular regulators such as osteopontin, nuclear factor kappa B, and acid sphingomyelinase, have been implicated in the regional-specific arterial remodeling induced by weightlessness. However, a systematic genetic and molecular explanation for these vascular changes remains elusive.",

Traditional molecular biology techniques have struggled to discern the differential cellular responses to weightless environments, despite previous transcriptomic analyses of the vasculature under microgravity. While ECs and SMCs have been the focus of much research, the roles of fibroblasts and macrophages in vascular remodeling under simulated microgravity have not been well-defined. The advent of scRNA-seq has enabled the exploration of transcriptional heterogeneity across various vascular cell types. In this study, we conducted scRNA-seq on CA and FA from rats subjected to 3 months of tail suspension and compared them to age-matched controls under normal gravity conditions. This approach aimed to elucidate artery-specific and cell type-specific molecular signatures, identify key cell sub-clusters, assess intercellular communication networks, and identify important transcription factors. Our findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the structural and functional vascular changes observed in space.",

Downregulation of Edn1 which encodes ET-1 may give rise to decreased vasoconstriction and basal vascular tone in HU-CA. The protein levels of eNOS (Fig. 2C), which was coded by Nos3, and ET-1 (Fig. 2D) were verified by immunofluorescence. Mmrn1 and Vwf were increased in HU-CA, promoting platelet adhesion and clotting. Ccn1, essential for atherogenesis, was reported to be induced by oscillatory shear stress and inhibited by laminar shear stress. It was upregulated in HU-FA but downregulated in HU-CA, highlighting the differential shear stress impacts on the CA and FA. KEGG pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, such as Rpl37, Rpl36, Rpl35, in ECs from both HU-CA and HU-FA when compared to their Con counterparts (Fig. 2E, F).",

            "text": "Sub-clustering analysis of ECs revealed 6 sub-clusters. Sub-cluster 0 showed high expression of Isl1 (Fig. 2G), a marker of embryonic stem cell-derived progenitors, indicating the potential of self-renewal. The sub-cluster also featured increased expression of Bmp6, a gene implicated in osteogenic differentiation of ECs during vascular calcification. This sub-cluster showed enrichment for KEGG terms related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2H), which was confirmed by GSVA analysis result that sub-cluster 0 was involved in protein secretion and unfolded protein response (Fig. 2I). Compared to FA, more ECs from CA were in sub-cluster 0 (Fig. 2J). Contrary to sub-cluster 0, sub-cluster 1 demonstrated a more enrichment of cell number in FA (Fig. 2H). Lipe and Gpihbp1, involved in lipolytic process, were two markers for sub-cluster 1. Sub-cluster 1 specifically exhibited enrichment for the “Rap1 signaling pathway” and its downstream “PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway” (Fig. 2K), which are known to play roles in cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Consistent with this, Cxcl12, another marker of sub-cluster 1, is recognized for its involvement in endothelial migration. For EC sub-cluster 2, marker genes Rpl30 and Rps25 were crucial for ribosome assembly and protein translation. Consistently, GO enrichment analysis indicated significant enrichment for the terms “Translation” and “Structural constituent of ribosome” in EC sub-cluster 2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S2). The EC sub-cluster 3 expressed Lyve1, a lymphatic endothelial marker, suggesting this population was lymphatic endothelium. The definition of sub-cluster 3 was further confirmed by the elevated expression of Ccl21, a chemokine produced by lymphatic endothelial cells. Notably, there were more lymphatic endothelial cells in FA than that in CA (Fig. 2J). Cnn1, a canonical marker of SMCs and a late indicator of EndoMT, is a hallmark of EC sub-cluster 4. EndoMT is a process whereby endothelial cells undergo phenotype changes towards to mesenchymal cells such as SMCs and fibroblasts. EndoMT is integral to the pathogenesis of conditions such as hypertension-induced vascular injury and atherosclerosis. The sub-cluster 4 also expresses the myogenic marker Acta2 which encodes α-SMA and Pln which encodes phospholamban, a regulator of ER Ca2+ homeostasis in angiogenesis, suggesting a mesenchymal cell phenotype possibly due to EndoMT. To further confirm EndoMT, we compared the differential expression of endothelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers between the HU group and the Con group. The dot plot showed that the expression of Tie1, Cdh5, and Vwf was downregulated, whereas the expression of S100a4, Vimentin and smooth muscle cell markers Acta2, Spp1 and Cnn1 was upregulated in EC sub-cluster 4 of HU-CA in comparison with Con counterpart (Additional file 1: Fig. S3A). Moreover, the expression of Cdh5 was decreased and the expression of S100a4, Vimentin was increased in EC sub-cluster 5 of both HU-CA and HU-FA compared to their Con counterparts (Additional file 1: Fig. S3B). Additionally, Cald1 is a molecule that distinguishes smooth muscle cells from fibroblasts, being exclusively expressed in smooth muscle cells. The results demonstrated that the expression of Cald1 in sub-cluster 4 was significantly higher than that in sub-cluster 5 (Additional file 1: Fig. S3C), suggesting the smooth muscle cell phenotype in sub-cluster 4.",

            "text": "To delve deeper, we employed pseudotime analysis to simulate the EndoMT transition of EC sub-clusters into fibroblasts and SMCs. As shown in Fig. 2L, a subset of EC sub-cluster 4 appeared to be positioned between the ECs and SMCs in biological evolution. Besides, sub-cluster 5 of ECs was located at the intermediate stage of differentiation between fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Then 3 different cell states were identified: state 1, 2, 3. The ECs were primarily distributed in states 1, located in the initial state of the cell differentiation trajectory. The fibroblasts and SMCs were predominantly distributed in states 2 and 3, representing the final stage of the differentiation trajectory. Subsequently, genes with significant changes over pseudotime were clustered, followed by KEGG enrichment analysis for each cluster (Fig. 2 M). Cluster 1 gene set manifested protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. Cluster 2 gene set exhibited enrichment of vascular smooth muscle contraction. Additionally, we used gene clusters 1 and 2 as target genes for TF prediction and found Egr2, Spi1 and Nrf1 may play important roles in the differentiation process of ECs to fibroblasts, and Klf15, Nr5a2 and Zfx may be crucial for the transition of ECs into SMCs (Additional file 1: Fig. S4). We also compared the pseudotime trajectories between CA and FA. It was found that the process of EC sub-cluster 4 differentiating into SMCs occured only in the CA while transition of ECs into fibroblasts occurred in CA and FA (Fig. 2 N). Besides, EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA exclusively exhibited differentiation into SMCs compared to Con-CA, as shown in Fig. 2O. Tail suspension simulated weightlessness might also promote transition of EC sub-cluster 4 to fibroblasts in FA (Additional file 1: Fig. S5).",

            "text": "In our study, SMCs exhibited heightened transcription of Acta2 in both HU-CA and HU-FA, signifying an increase in α-SMA levels (Fig. 3A, B). This could explain the observed increase in carotid artery intima-media thickness in tail-suspended rats, despite a reduced SMC cell count in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. Our research also confirmed the increased intima-media thickness in HU-CA (Fig. 3C). The selective upregulation of the ryanodine receptor (Trdn), the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channel (Cacna1d) and Pln are integral to ER Ca2+ homeostasis. The increased expression of these genes indicated a hypercontractile state in HU-CA SMCs. The protein level of PLN was verified by immunostaining (Fig. 3D). Regarding the ECM, HU-CA SMCs showed a decrease in genes encoding elastin (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col4a1, Col6a1), laminins (Lamc1, Lamb1, Lama2), thrombospondins (Thbs2, Thbs3), and fibronectin (Fn1) when compared to Con-CA. Notably, genes encoding components of the ribosome, such as Rpl37 and Rpl41, were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs relative to Con-CA. However, a downregulation of genes Rps2 and Rps27a was noted in HU-FA compared to Con-FA (Fig. 3B, Additional file 1: Fig. S6). Additionally, the expression level of genes (Spp1, Msx2, Bmp2) encoding vascular calcification markers (OPN, MSX2, BMP2) were elevated in HU-FA compared to Con-FA, indicating the tendency of calcification of FA but not CA. Collectively, these results highlighted the heterogeneity between the forebody and hindbody arteries of hindlimb-unloaded rats. This was possibly due to differential transmural pressures across the CA and FA as a result of hindlimb unloading.",

Sub-cluster 0 was characterized by elevated levels of Col4a6, Acta2, and glutamine synthetase 2 (Gls2), a regulator of glutaminolysis and ferroptosis. The enriched GO term “organonitrogen compound metabolic process” highlighted this sub-cluster’s metabolic role (Fig. 3F). Sub-cluster 1 was marked by the presence of Sacsin, encoding a chaperone involved in intermediate filament assembly and the ryanodine receptor 2 (Ryr2), crucial for calcium release and SMC contraction. Sub-cluster 2 featured the gene for vitronectin (Vtn), an glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion, and Higd1b, which maintains mitochondrial integrity under hypoxia. This sub-cluster was more prevalent in the FA than in the CA (Fig. 3G). Sub-cluster 3 was defined by Ndufa4 and Rps20. NDUFA4 is a component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain essential for mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Rps20 encodes a ribosomal protein. The sub-cluster’s contribution to ribosome construction was indicated by the GO terms “structure constituent of ribosome” (Fig. 3H). The markers of sub-cluster 4 are oncofetal gene Gpc3 and SMCs progenitor marker Pi16. According to GSVA (Fig. 3I), sub-cluster 4 showed enrichment of “Hedgehog signaling pathway” which is essential in embryogenesis and a key regulator of stem cell. High expression of ECM-related genes in this sub cluster, demonstrated by GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3J), heralded that sub-cluster 4 was major contributor to the surrounding microenvironmental vascular matrix. The marker of sub-cluster 5 Esco2 is involved in tethering between sister chromatids during DNA double-strand break repair. Another marker Gas2l3 is responsible for linking actin and microtubule filaments in interphase of cells and plays a pivotal role in mitosis and cytokinesis. Consistently, GSVA revealed that “G2M checkpoint”, “mitotic spindle signaling pathway” were enriched in SMCs sub-cluster 5. The enrichment of GO term “cell cycle” (Fig. 3K) and the enrichment of KEGG terms “DNA replication” and “spliceosome” (Fig. 3L) further confirmed the role of this sub-cluster in cell cycle. Notably, this sub-cluster had a higher percentage of G2-phase cells and a lower percentage of non-cycling cells compared to others (Fig. 3M). The percentage of sub-cluster 4 and 5 in CA and FA was lower after hindlimb unloading (Fig. 3G), suggesting that hindlimb unloading may inhibit the cell cycle of SMCs.",

As for ECM, an upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 (Fig. 4C), which encode PAI-1 and PN-1 respectively, indicated heightened antifibrinolytic activity and the limitation in matrix breakdown in HU-CA. The upregulation of Nox4 and Txnip (Fig. 4C, D) may give rise to increased oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in HU-CA and HU-FA.

Phenotypic transformation of adventitial fibroblasts, which is characterized by elevated expression of Acta2 (Fig. 4C, D), is important in the process of vascular diseases.

GSVA analysis revealed an enrichment of myogenesis-related genes in HU-CA (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A), hinting at fibroblast involvement in the modulation of intima-media thickness during hindlimb unloading.

This analysis underscored the significant role of fibroblasts and SMCs in cellular communication. Specifically, SMCs received signals from Spp1, Laminin, Collagen, Fn1, and Ptn, while fibroblasts were receptive to signals from Mif, Pdgf, and Wnt (Fig. 6C). In terms of signal emission, SMCs released signals including Spp1, Notch, and Ephb, whereas fibroblasts secreted Cd99, Fn1, Sema3, and Igf (Fig. 6D). Then we compared interaction strength between HU-CA and Con-CA (Fig. 6E). For ECM-related ligand-receptor pairs, Col4a1_Sdc4, Col4a4_Sdc4, Fn1_Itga8/Itgb1, Fn1_Sdc4, Lamb2_Itga7/Itgb1 were increased between ECs and SMCs. However, the interactions of ligands including lama4, lama5, lamb1 and lamc1 and receptors including Itga7/Itgb1 and Dag1 within SMCs of CA were decreased after HU. In our study, we also assessed the secreted signaling of specific ligand-receptor pairs. Notably, the anti-inflammatory interaction between Pros1 and Axl was diminished in the communication between fibroblasts and SMCs after HU in CA. Midkine (Mdk), a heparin-binding growth factor involved in cell growth, survival, migration, and angiogenesis, exhibited reduced interactions from fibroblasts with its transmembrane receptors Lrp1, Ncl, Sdc2, and Sdc4 on SMCs in HU-CA compared to Con-CA. These ligand-receptor interactions were similarly attenuated within fibroblasts in HU-CA. Furthermore, arterial endothelial Ackr3, known to mediate endothelium-immune cell adhesion, showed an increased interaction with Mif from SMCs in HU-CA versus Con-CA. The interaction of Mif_Ackr3 pair was also enhanced within ECs. Additionally, the Pdgfa_Pdgfrb signaling pair was likewise augmented within SMCs.",

The enhanced activity of inflammation-related Fos, Jun, Cebpb in fibroblast might responsible for vascular remodeling in CA and FA after HU. Compared to the control group, the transcriptional activity of Ddit3, also known as Chop, was significantly increased in fibroblasts of the HU group (Fig. 7C, Additional file 1: Fig. S9A). Ddit3 plays a crucial role in endoplasmic reticulum stress and has recently been found to be important in glucose metabolism. This finding may partially explain the observed changes in metabolic pathways in fibroblasts within the HU group as mentioned earlier (Fig. 5G, H). As of SMC, transcription factors Fos, Fosb, Srf and Jund exhibited differential expression between the CA and FA, while Mef2c is significantly upregulated in both CA and FA after HU (Fig. 7D, Additional file 1: Fig. S9B). Given the pivotal role of Mef2c in smooth muscle differentiation, the increased expression of Acta2 in HU-CA and HU-FA might be attributed to the enhanced activity of Mef2c. Zeb1, which is involved in epithelial–mesenchymal transition and plays a protective role in the process of atherosclerosis, had elevated activities in SMC of HU-CA (Fig. 7D). Atf4, recognized for its role in angiogenic activation and its ability to heterodimerize with other TFs such as Cebpb and Jund, and AP-1 family member Jun and Fos, exhibited greater activity in HU-FA and HU-CA compared to Con groups in EC. Meanwhile, the atheroprotective Klf4 demonstrated heightened activity in ECs of HU-FA but not HU-CA (Fig. 7E, Additional file 1: Fig. S9C). Additionally, we constructed the TF-target gene network of some TFs and noticed that Jun, Fosb and Mef2c shared some target genes. Acta2 is related to Srf and Ets1 according to this network (Fig. 7F), which has enlightening effects on studying the mechanism of Acta2 upregulation in several cell types.",

A comparative analysis between the HU and Con groups revealed a notable decrease in the proportion of SMCs in both the CA and FA after tail suspension.

However, knowledge about vascular fibroblasts from rats exposed to hindlimb suspension is lacking. ScRNA-seq offers an opportunity to detect gene expression of vascular fibroblasts from HU-CA and HU-FA. The upregulation of Serpine1 and Serpine2 suggested impaired matrix degradation in CA and FA after microgravity. Additionally, the heightened expression of Txnip indicated the elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory state of fibroblasts in HU-CA and HU-FA. Metabolic processes in adventitial fibroblasts were also found to be altered post-hindlimb unloading in the CA and FA, emphasizing the importance of fibroblast metabolic changes in vascular remodeling.

Our findings confirmed this, with the CA and FA showing some divergent changes. For instance, genes involved in ribosome subunits were upregulated in HU-CA SMCs but downregulated in HU-FA SMCs compared to controls. However, we also found some similarities in arterial changes between CA and FA, suggesting that there may be other factors contributing to arterial remodeling in addition to headward fluid shift under microgravity. Notably, the expression of Acta2, which encodes α-SMA, was enhanced in SMCs of both HU-CA and HU-FA. This, coupled with the reduced proportion of SMCs in the CA and FA, helps us understand the mechanism behind the intima-media thickening in HU-CA. We speculate that the elevated Acta2 expression may predominantly contribute to intima-media thickening in the CA, while the decreased SMC fraction in HU-FA could counteract the increased Acta2 expression. Moreover, the upregulation of inflammation-related TFs (Klf4, Fos, Jun, Cebpb) across several cell types, the upregulation of Cxcr4 in HU-CA and HU-FA macrophages, and heightened Txnip expression in fibroblasts collectively suggest a possible inflammatory state in the circulatory system of hindlimb-unweighted rats. This study reports for the first time the high levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in the upper and lower body blood vessels under simulated weightlessness. This finding was consistent to previous research showing an inflammatory response in the CA of rats subjected to hindlimb unloading. Similarly, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation have been found elevated in astronauts following long-duration spaceflight. Additionally, the downregulation of these genes associated with elastic fibers (Eln), collagens (Col1a1, Col3a1), and other ECM components (Lox, Sparc) in the CA and FA of hindlimb-unweighted rats may partially explain the observed decrease in vascular distensibility and the increased vascular stiffness reported previously.",

Notably, only EC sub-cluster 4 from HU-CA was in the process of differentiation into SMCs. This finding was evidenced by the pseudotime analysis. EndoMT is a kind of phenotypic switch through which ECs gain mesenchymal-like properties, resulting in enhanced migration and endothelial dysfunction. Inducers of EndoMT include biochemical and biomechanical stimuli. We postulate that elevated transmural pressure in the CA of rats subjected to tail suspension could be a contributing factor. Another possibility is that increased expression of Serpine1 in fibroblasts mediated EndoMT as previously reported. Endothelial impairment was reported during and after spaceflight. The finding of EndoMT in this study may provide new insight of endothelial impairment.
