This process is one of the leading culprits in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) within bacterial communities and could pose a significant health threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions. In order to better understand the degree of HGT activity that could occur in space, biosafety level-2, donor and recipient bacteria were co-cultured under simulated microgravity (SMG) on Earth with concomitant 1G controls. Two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, from the donor Acinetobacter pittii, were tracked in four recipient strains of Staphylococcus aureus (which did not harbor those genes) using polymerase chain reaction. All four S. aureus strains that were co-cultured with A. pittii under SMG had a significantly higher number of isolates that were now blaOXA-500- and ISAba1-positive compared to growth at 1G. The acquisition of these genes by the recipient induced a phenotypic change, as these isolates were now resistant to oxacillin, which they were previously susceptible to. This is a novel study, presenting, for the first time, increased HGT activity under SMG and the potential impact of the space environment in promoting increased gene dissemination within bacterial communities.",

Bacterial communities have also been found beyond the Earth’s surface on the International Space Station (ISS), a low-gravity, high-radiation, hermetically sealed built environment. The microbial communities characterized here consist of environmental organisms, human-associated commensal bacteria and biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) microbes, resistant to various antibiotics, and carrying numerous anti-microbial resistance genes. This resistance could potentially pose a serious threat to astronauts if they fell ill, especially on long-duration space missions, as medical attention would not be readily available.",

In dynamic mixed communities, either human or environmental, HGT between species may confer an overall fitness advantage to the community, as the acquisition of new traits in individual cells within that community allows them to better adapt to changing conditions. In other cases, HGT may have an unfavorable effect if it leads to an excessive accumulation of genes, or a neutral one, if there is no impact on the fitness of the organism.",

In a follow-up analysis conducted by our group using the ISS resistome and microbiome data presented by Urbaniak et al. 2018, we performed a series of correlation analyses to determine which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were associated with which species. Interestingly, no statistically significant correlations were found. These data, coupled by the Concordia/ISS study, led us to hypothesize that the stressors of the ISS, specifically microgravity, promote enhanced HGT between organisms, compared to what would be observed on Earth.",

The donor and recipient strains were Acinetobacter pittii (strain IIF1SW-P1) and Staphylococcus aureus (strains IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW), respectively. All strains were previously isolated from various locations on the ISS as part of the Microbial-1 Tracking study. A. pittii IIF1SW-P1 was chosen as the donor, since it was previously shown by our group to be resistant to oxacillin and contained the chromosomally located blaOXA-500 gene within its genome, a beta-lactamase which alone can confer resistance to oxacillin. The four S. aureus strains, IF4SW, IIF6SW, IF7SW, IIF8SW, were chosen as recipients because they were susceptible to oxacillin and harbored neither the blaOXA-500 gene nor any other beta-lactamase genes. The donor, A. pittii, harbored ISAba1, a transposable element that can jump between segments of the genome and, in some cases, can act as a promoter region for blaOXA genes, allowing for increased resistance to oxacillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. ISAba1 was not found in either of the recipient S. aureus strains. HGT ability was, therefore, tracked between A. pittii and S. aureus using the AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1.",

A single colony from each plate was added to 10 mL of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in a 50 mL Falcon tube for S. aureus, and 8 mL of TSB in a snap cap tube for A. pittii and grown overnight (~20 h) in a shaking incubator at 85 rpm. A low speed was chosen, so as to not dislodge pili or flagella that could be used for HGT, but high enough that the bacteria did not settle out of culture over time. The overnight culture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000× g, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet washed in 1× sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pellets were then resuspended in 10 mL of 1× PBS. For S. aureus, 1 mL was then transferred to 9 mL of PBS and, for A. pittii, the tube was topped with 3 mL of PBS. The biomass of the cultures was measured with DENSICHEK® (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France) and adjusted with PBS to reach a concentration of 108 cfu/mL, which was then serially diluted to 106 cfu/mL. 100 µL of one S. aureus recipient strain was added to 10 mL of TSB and 100 µL of the donor A. pittii was added to the same 10 mL tube to set up the co-cultures. After gentle mixing, the complete 10 mL volume containing the donor and recipient was carefully added to HARVs to avoid any bubbles.

This transfer led to functional changes, as the acquisition of the two AMR genes, blaOXA-500 and ISAba1, that were tracked in the four strains of S. aureus, made them resistant to oxacillin, to which they were previously susceptible. These results have significant implications for long-duration space missions because pathogens that are susceptible to antibiotics could become resistant and thus harder to treat. In addition, even if astronauts are screened for problematic microbes prior to flight, issues could still arise, as commensals are known to act as reservoirs for AMR genes that can be disseminated to (opportunistic) pathogens. For example, a study conducted in a hospital in the Netherlands showed that mecA gene transfer occurred in a patient between mecA+ S. epidermidis and a mecA− strain of S. aureus.",

            "text": "It was beyond the scope of the study to determine the cause of the increased HGT that was observed, but one mechanism could be increased competence, allowing for transformation to occur, one of three modes of gene transfer. Competence allows bacterial cells to uptake DNA from its environment and increase the response to different stressors. In this case, naked DNA released from dead A. pittii cells could have been readily taken up by S. aureus when exposed to SMG due to an increase in its competence. While S. aureus is not classically considered to be naturally competent, as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus subtilis are, it does harbor genes that are involved in competence and thought to promote natural competence under the right conditions. The conditions that S. aureus needs are not yet known, but, similar to other bacteria, it could be an adverse environment. Indeed, when S. aureus cells were subjected to heat-shock, cold-shock and the stringent response, there was increased expression of competence gene orthologs compared to the non-stressed conditions. In S. pneumoniae and B. subtilis, competence confers a survival advantage when cells are subjected to stress, so there is a possibility that growth under SMG led to an adverse environment for S. aureus, causing cells to become more competent to increase survival. Conjugation is a less likely scenario since, consistent with what others have documented in the literature, blaOXA-500 is located on the chromosome and not a plasmid. A second mechanism could be increased transduction caused by growth under SMG. Transduction is the transfer of genetic material via bacterial phages. It is well known that prophage activity is increased during stress, leading to increased phage production, helping the host survive these adverse conditions.",
