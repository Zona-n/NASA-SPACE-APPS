Here, we measured methylation of DNA associated with the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene, a gene important in development and plasticity, and telomere length in the brains of adult rat male and female offspring whose mothers were exposed to unpredictable and variable stressors throughout gestation. Males exposed to prenatal stress had greater methylation (Bdnf IV) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed male controls and stressed females. Further, prenatally-stressed animals had shorter telomeres than controls in the mPFC. Together findings indicate a long-term impact of prenatal stress on brain DNA methylation and telomere biology with relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to intergenerational molecular changes.",

For example, individuals exposed to famine during gestation (such as that of the Dutch Famine of 1944) have significant physical health problems including cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure. Gestational famine exposure also produces long-lasting neurobiological and behavioral consequences, including an increased incidence of schizophrenia. Psychosocial stress experienced by the mother during gestation likewise produces vulnerability to psychopathology in offspring, including increased risk for schizophrenia and depression. Further, work from various animal models provides additional evidence that a suboptimal intrauterine environment has long-term physical and behavioral consequences for offspring (for reviews see).",

            "text": "One way that prenatal stress could affect brain function and behavior is through epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation. DNA methylation is characterized by the addition of methyl groups to cytosines, typically at cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CG sites), which can dampen transcriptional activity through the blockade of transcription factors or the recruitment of transcriptional silencing machinery. Recent studies have also highlighted the role of active DNA demethylation in regulating transcription within the CNS, and candidates thought to reverse DNA methylation include ten-eleven-translocation (TET) proteins, GADD45b, and MBD2. Though historically associated with early cell development and differentiation, there is now a vast literature showing that DNA methylation/demethylation remains an active process even occurring in mature neurons. Further, studies in humans and animal models have highlighted the ability of prenatal stress to alter DNA methylation at various gene loci, including the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene. BDNF is crucial for development and plasticity in the developing and adult brain and is implicated in various psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD. Given the widespread functioning of BDNF across brain regions throughout early development, this locus may play a role in translating prenatal stress to adult phenotypic outcomes including psychopathology.",

Studies continue to show that various forms of early-life stress (e.g., perinatal complications, psychological stress, physical abuse, etc.) during the prenatal or postnatal period shorten telomere length in the periphery. Given that telomeres are dynamically regulated during the first years of life, examining neural changes in telomere length following prenatal stress is another important avenue for understanding how stress experienced in early-life may relate to future mental well-being.",

            "text": "In daily life, humans tend to be exposed to unpredictable challenges that vary in magnitude and duration. Studies of prenatal stress in rodents often employ repeated presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, most frequently, immobilization stress, a well-known stressor in rodents. Rodent studies however provide evidence for habituation to predictable, non-varying stressors. In contrast, chronic variable stress in adult males is associated with greater HPA axis responses, including baseline hypersecretion of corticosterone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin, as well as adrenal hypertrophy. Repeated exposure of pregnant rats to uncontrollable stress elicited a prolonged (24–48hr) increase in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids from gestational day 4 to 20, an effect also observed in day 20 fetuses, suggesting that habituation to variable stressors across the rat’s three week pregnancy is minimal. Importantly, as compared to studies employing presentations of a single, non-varying stressor, studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms have reported etiological changes that may be more closely linked to psychiatric disorders. Collectively, these findings suggest that variable, unpredictable stress may model the human condition with greater fidelity than invariant stress paradigms.",

Eight samples failed to amplify in the amygdala (2 females and 2 males in the control condition and 1 female and 3 males in the UVPS condition) and were thus excluded from analyses.

Telomere length between conditions and sexes was likewise analyzed with two-way ANOVAs for each brain region. Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were used when appropriate for post hoc analyses.

The findings here complement our previous work with regard to stress effects on a common brain region (i.e., the mPFC), but differ in the direction of telomere change. Similar to methylation, it is likely that the type (maltreatment vs. maternal separation vs. variable stress) and timing (pre- vs. postnatal) of stress can differentially affect brain telomere length, and future studies are certainly warranted to better understand the parameters affecting brain telomere length. How our telomere data functionally link to our methylation data is not known, but telomerase activity is necessary for the cell survival-promoting effects of BDNF in neurons. Further evidence of a putative link between BDNF and telomeres is the observation of a reduction in hippocampal telomerase activity, telomere length, and Bdnf expression in a rodent model of depression.",

These findings are consistent with reports that prenatal stress leads to heightened stress sensitivity, especially among males, including studies employing variable prenatal stress paradigms. In accord with previous research linking prenatal stress with changes in body weight regulation and metabolic disorders, adult body weights of prenatally stressed male (but not female) offspring of the present study were significantly elevated relative to non-stressed offspring (Ronca, unpublished). Our findings indicate that, in addition to brain epigenetic and telomeric changes, unpredictable, variable gestational stress exerts clear sex-specific programming effects on the physical and behavioral health of the offspring. It is unclear whether our data reported here are consistent with the notion that males are more susceptible or females are more resilient to stress, but evidence for sex-based vulnerability and resilience to a variety of stressors continues to grow.",

            "text": "The study reported herein provides seminal evidence in a rodent model for an enduring influence of prenatal stress on both brain DNA methylation and telomere length in adulthood. Going forward, the challenge will be to identify the specific role(s) of these molecular brain changes in relation to the diverse effects of early-life stressors. Recent progress characterizing physiological and structural changes in the brain associated with prenatal stress, and their sex-specificity, may provide important new insights. Neuronal changes are highly region-specific with the most dramatic changes occurring in limbic and prefrontal cortical areas, those involved in cognition and emotional behavior. Altered neurogenesis, neuronal density, neuronal arborization, dendritic architecture, synaptic connectivity, and myelination have all been reported in animal models of prenatal stress. Prenatal stress also disrupts sex-specific maturation of the PFC that normally occurs in adolescence, thus our results could reflect not only sensitivity of the developing PFC to gestational stress but also a disruption of normative periadolescent maturation. Telomere length may be related to cellular changes in a variety of cell-types throughout the brain, including glia. Relating cellular alterations to epigenetic and telomeric changes in specific brain regions (including those epigenetic and telomeric observations reported here, and of course other presumed concomitant changes) are certain to produce a deeper understanding of the far-reaching effects of prenatal stress.",

            "text": "While extensive progress has been made in the understanding of the role of early-life adversity in the development of psychiatric and metabolic disorders, more detailed research on sex-specific, epigenetic, brain structural and behavioral changes is warranted. In particular, consistency across gestational stress paradigms, including the predictability and timing of stressor, the use of common behavioral and endpoint measures, and comparisons between male and females are vital for uncovering consistent and meaningful patterns of neurobiological changes induced by prenatal stress. Our present findings may have relevance for behavioral and health outcomes, and contribute to a growing literature linking stress to early developmental programming, intergenerational epigenetic transmission of environmental exposures, and telomere biology. Illuminating molecular mechanisms underlying multigenerational programming of stress responses and mental and physical health outcomes are important first steps toward establishing therapeutic interventions to halt the generational persistence of pathological outcomes associated with early life adversity.",
