Accordingly, with NASA setting the course to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of paramount importance. One area of particular concern is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in space experiments. Combined with a depressed or altered immune response in astronauts, there is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infection. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation, and bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were more resistant than isolates obtained from the same individual either pre- or post-flight. Mutations also occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis to increased virulence or microbial resistance to antibiotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the stability of pharmaceuticals. In any case, bacterial infections might be more challenging to treat in space.",

Be et al. analyzed antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), demonstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal microbiomes of astronauts that spent 6 to 12 months in the ISS have been shown to be altered. In addition, the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as a result of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that promote viral replication and altering the abundance of some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. The ISS itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shotgun metagenome and amplicon sequencing, analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific geographies on Earth.",

            "text": "Computational analyses of microbiome data collected in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from genomic sequence of pure cultures alone, but a consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established. Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requiring a ‘best-hit’ on an appropriate AMR database with a sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs such as ResFinder. Although the ‘best-hit’ approach has a low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can be very high, and a large number of actual Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs, thus concealing the identification of potentially functional ARGs. Another method of identification is to link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the peptides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires complex coordination with crew sampling and is rare. However, it has been shown recently that deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, can expand the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy of the predictions based on metagenomic data. We then hypothesized that the characterization of AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investigated from an artificial intelligence perspective using a robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated samples (Fig. 1) using the supervised deep learning approach proposed by Arango-Argoty et al., which has shown high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an independent benchmark.",

A detailed description of sampling procedures and locations, species diversity and functional characterization can be found in Singh et al.. To deploy a deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG, a computational resource proven to be more accurate than traditional approaches. We first run DeepARG-SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended prediction probability cut-off of 0.8 to obtain read counts of AMR genes (Fig. 2a). As in the seminal paper, quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR revealed ‘beta lactams’ ranking first and ‘peptide’ second, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in Flight 3 (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig. 2a). However, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuromutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in Flight 2 (Fig. 2a). Our read counts correlate (r = 0.86, p = 6.879e−7; Pearson’s product-moment correlation) with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by Singh et al. (Fig. 2b).

            "text": "To investigate the possible association between AMR patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs; see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using DeepARG-LS. Figure 3a shows the distribution of DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit identity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve highly probable ARGs (probability > 0.8) presenting low sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this method is likely more advantageous than using the ‘best-hit’ approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig. 3b). However, interestingly the results show a smaller number bacterial species having ARGs in Flight #1 (F1) when compared to Flights #2 and #3 (Fig. 3b, c) (data is shown for MAGs with at least 1 predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is smaller in Flight 1 (n = 3) than in F2 (n = 6) and F3 (n = 7) (Fig. 3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, showing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS (Fig. 3c). Of note, the K. piersonii strain closely related to one found at the ISS has been associated to human urinary tract infection. The potentially very pathogenic microbe E. bugandensis was found in location 2 (forward side panel wall of the Waste and Hygiene Compartment) in Flight 1, presenting more than 40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea species were found to be the dominant genus in samples in 5 out of 7 locations sampled from Flight 3, especially at location 5 (surface rack). In our re-analysis, we observed Pantoea brenneri and Pantoea dispersa having ARGs related to beta-lactams and peptide, as well as to triclosan and polymyxin resistance.",

We found a range of 2 to 92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig. 4a; Table S1). This machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA similarity (Figure S1). These results suggest a widespread presence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with ‘multi-drug’ class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams, bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The ‘multi-drug’ antibiotic class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by DeepARG to microbial species (Fig. 4a) and identified Bacillus cereus and E. bugandensis, which were previously profiled organisms on the ISS as the top 2 ranking species with a high number of ARGs. We have previously shown that five E. bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin. In addition, E. bugandensis strains were shown to be resistant to 9 antibiotics. Our results reinforce the potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, antimicrobial resistance was not examined for B. cereus strains in Venkateswaran et al.. B. cereus is a food poisoning microorganism that might be a concern for crew members' health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated with other species such as K. pneumoniae, Pantoea, Paenibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus faecalis, Sphingomonas, and, with a lower number of ARGs, several species of Staphylococcus. E. faecalis virulence was previously shown to be affected by microgravity. We then used the tool Prokka to fully annotate the bacterial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in proportion to genome sizes (Figure S2a). Then, we ran the pan-genome analysis tool Roary to compare isolates of E. bugandensis (10) and B. cereus (10) finding that the core set of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same species (Figure S2b).",

For that, we use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the following antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta−lactam), Cefoxitin (beta−lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta−lactam), Penicillin (beta−lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig. 4b).

            "text": "Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples that were treated with PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis showed increased read counts associated with AMR and in more locations for flight 3 when considering MAGs (Fig. 2). This could be explained due to the ISS crew being replaced during Flight 3. The abundance of Enterobacteriaceae in Flight 3 was discussed in Singh et al.. We have not observed any differences between early vs. late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter bugandansis strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analyses revealed limited change, with a maximum of 15 SNPs among ISS isolates. In addition, K. piersonii spread across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight 3, presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig. 3c). We have previously isolated strains from Locations 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, defining a novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples. While K. piersonii do have virulence genes in the genome, a dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder algorithm predicted K. piersonii strains as non-human pathogens. All seven K. piersonii isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam), and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were susceptible to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramycin (aminoglycoside). The DeepARG database does not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoroquinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results. Therefore, PathogenFinder results in Singh et al. suggesting K. piersonii as a non-human pathogen should be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22 (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated in urine microbiome of a kidney stone patient has shown to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence factors that are needed for host cell invasion and colonization.",

Up to five strains isolated from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077) and share similar AMR patterns. One hundred twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, disease, and defence in the ISS strains. Our re-analysis confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the isolates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump, belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria. MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to substances like host defense molecule and bile, which can lead to pathogenicity in humans. Unlike in Singh et al., we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and null for fosfomycin. Conversely, B. cereus is a gram-positive bacterium commonly found in food. After infection, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in some cases, the toxin can be fatal via a fulminant hepatic failure. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found widespread in many microbes.",
