            "text": "The wasps Leptopilina heterotoma parasitize and ingest their Drosophila hosts. They produce extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the venom that are packed with proteins, some of which perform immune suppressive functions. EV interactions with blood cells of host larvae are linked to hematopoietic depletion, immune suppression, and parasite success. But how EVs disperse within the host, enter and kill hematopoietic cells is not well understood. Using an antibody marker for L. heterotoma EVs, we show that these parasite-derived structures are readily distributed within the hosts’ hemolymphatic system. EVs converge around the tightly clustered cells of the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the larval lymph gland, a small hematopoietic organ in Drosophila. The PSC serves as a source of developmental signals in naïve animals. In wasp-infected animals, the PSC directs the differentiation of lymph gland progenitors into lamellocytes. These lamellocytes are needed to encapsulate the wasp egg and block parasite development. We found that L. heterotoma infection disassembles the PSC and PSC cells disperse into the disintegrating lymph gland lobes. Genetically manipulated PSC-less lymph glands remain non-responsive and largely intact in the face of L. heterotoma infection. We also show that the larval lymph gland progenitors use the endocytic machinery to internalize EVs. Once inside, L. heterotoma EVs damage the Rab7- and LAMP-positive late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. Rab5 maintains hematopoietic and immune quiescence as Rab5 knockdown results in hematopoietic over-proliferation and ectopic lamellocyte differentiation. Thus, both aspects of anti-parasite immunity, i.e., (a) phagocytosis of the wasp’s immune-suppressive EVs, and (b) progenitor differentiation for wasp egg encapsulation reside in the lymph gland. These results help explain why the lymph gland is specifically and precisely targeted for destruction. The parasite’s simultaneous and multipronged approach to block cellular immunity not only eliminates blood cells, but also tactically blocks the genetic programming needed for supplementary hematopoietic differentiation necessary for host success. In addition to its known functions in hematopoiesis, our results highlight a previously unrecognized phagocytic role of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. EV-mediated virulence strategies described for L. heterotoma are likely to be shared by other parasitoid wasps; their understanding can improve the design and development of novel therapeutics and biopesticides as well as help protect biodiversity.",

Many parasitic wasps develop inside their hosts to emerge as free-living adults. To overcome the resistance of their hosts, parasitic wasps use varied and ingenious strategies such as mimicry, evasion, bioactive venom, virus-like particles, viruses, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We describe the effects of a unique class of EVs containing virulence proteins and produced in the venom of wasps that parasitize fruit flies of Drosophila species. EVs from Leptopilina heterotoma are widely distributed throughout the Drosophila hosts’ circulatory system after infection. They enter and kill macrophages by destroying the very same subcellular machinery that facilitates their uptake. An important protein in this process, Rab5, is needed to maintain the identity of the macrophage; when Rab5 function is reduced, macrophages turn into a different cell type called lamellocytes. Activities in the EVs can eliminate lamellocytes as well. EVs also interfere with the hosts’ genetic program that promotes lamellocyte differentiation needed to block parasite development. Thus, wasps combine specific preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete their hosts of the very cells that would otherwise sequester and kill them. These findings have applied value in agricultural pest control and medical therapeutics.",

Engaged in a biological “arms race,” each partner continuously adapts to the other to emerge alive. For reproductive success, parasitic wasps target their hosts’ behavior, development and immune system. Their attack mechanisms range from biochemical warfare and mimicry, to passive evasion and active immune suppression. Drosophila and their parasitic wasps are an emerging model for studying how wasps evade or suppress host defenses. The generalist Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh) succeeds on the Drosophila species within and beyond the melanogaster group. Its close relative, L. boulardi (Lb), considered a specialist, mainly infects flies of the melanogaster group.

Similar to SSp40’s localization to Lh EV spike tips, IpaD localizes to the tips of the T3 secretion injectisome, a bacterial transfer system that injects virulence proteins into mammalian cells. IpaD itself promotes apoptosis of mammalian macrophages. These parallels between Lh SSp40 and bacterial IpaD/SipD suggest that Lh EVs may share some similarities with bacterial secretion systems.

The term hemolymph refers to the interstitial fluid that distributes hormones, peptides and other macromolecules into organs through the pumping action of an unbranched tubular heart, or the dorsal vessel. Dozens of macrophages circulate in the hemolymph. The heart lumen is surrounded by a column of paired cardiomyocytes and associated pericardial cells. This tubular structure is held in place by alary muscles. Hematopoietic cells are organized in paired cell clusters (or lobes) on the dorsal vessel. In third instar larvae, the anterior-most lobes have blood cells at various stages of differentiation; the least differentiated progenitors are confined adjacent to the dorsal vessel, whereas the developing macrophages are sequestered in the cortical regions of the lobes (Fig 1A). In naïve hosts, the progenitor state is maintained by a putative niche (also called the posterior signaling center, PSC). The PSC is a tight unit of about 25–50 cells and is positioned posteriorly to the progenitors. Upon Lb infection, the PSC reprograms hematopoiesis inducing macrophage and lamellocyte differentiation.

We show an abundance of Lh EVs in (a) the lumen of the larval dorsal vessel, (b) along the collagen/perlecan-based basement membrane around the dorsal vessel and surrounding clusters of lymph gland progenitors, and (c) inside the progenitor and mature macrophages. Moreover, high EV signal correlates with the disassembly of the cohesive PSC unit. PSC ablation limits EV internalization and loss of lymph gland hemocytes, while PSC inactivation via hedgehog (hh) knockdown (KD) does not have this effect. We also show that lymph gland hemocytes can phagocytose Lh EVs using the classical Rab5-mediated retrograde transport (RGT) pathway. Surprisingly, Rab5 also maintains fly macrophage identity, as Rab5 KD leads to over-proliferation, lamellocyte differentiation and tumorigenesis; Rab5 function is cell-autonomous. Thus lymph glands are not merely a source of mature blood cells but are themselves immune competent organs and can clear the immune-suppressive Lh EVs to defend the host. However, Lh EVs proactively dislodge cells of the PSC, blocking differentiation of the protective immune cells. Lh EVs target the endomembrane system of macrophages that ultimately results in their apoptosis, thus highlighting central and previously unrecognized roles of the lymph gland in cellular immunity. These observations help explain why Lh infections target the larval lymph gland. The direct EV-macrophage interactions and cellular outcomes set the stage for future molecular analyses in both the hosts and parasites.",

A cohesive PSC is important in hematopoietic development as fewer macrophages and crystal cells develop in Slit/Robo2 KD lobes compared to controls. But differing from Lh infection, Slit KD PSCs are larger and there is no apparent loss of progenitors.

Moreover, while Lh-infected UAS-Hid lobes lost progenitors and exhibited high levels of EV uptake (Fig 3A, 3B, 3D and 3E), Lh-infected PSC-less lobes remained intact and showed low, non-specific SSp40 staining signal in anterior and posterior lobes (Fig 3C and 3F; n > 12 lobes for each condition). In contrast to the non-responsive Col>Hid lobes, Antp>hhRNAi lobes responded to Lh infection and suffered progenitor cell loss (S5A–S5F Fig; n > 12 lobes for each condition). Thus, inactivating the signaling function of the PSC does not appear to affect the wasp’s ability to disassemble the PSC. P1 staining revealed that Lh infection does not block macrophage differentiation (S5C Fig).

However, details underlying their apoptotic effects on macrophages have been lacking. This work provides the first view into how Lh EVs rely on the host’s circulation to gain system-wide distribution to not only precisely kill the available effector cells but also to pre-emptively interfere with the host’s ability to produce additional effector cells. We show that lymph glands serve an important, previously unappreciated role in immunity. A majority of lymph gland cells can phagocytose Lh EVs to protect the host from their detrimental effects.

We have shown that like microbes, Lh EVs are endocytosed and can damage the late endocytic compartments. This suggests that their biochemical activities may distort and damage intracellular membranes although how this occurs mechanistically is unclear. A novel family of Lh EV-associated GTPases are possible candidates for such activities as expression of select GTPases in yeast alter vacuolar morphologies.

Protein trap lines were: Collagen IV (Viking) and perlecan (Trol) (from A. Spradling and L. Cooley). In the hhf4f-GFP; Antp-GAL4/TM6 Tb Hu strain, the PSC is marked (from R.A. Schulz). In the Dome-MESO-GFP strain, the lymph gland medulla is GFP positive (, from M. Crozatier). We recombined this latter insertion with the Antp-GAL4 insertion to make a UAS-mCD8GFP; Antp-GAL4, Dome-MESO-GFP (AntpDMG) stock. hopTum-l, msn-GAL4; UAS-mCD8GFP uses the misshapen (msn) driver to mark lamellocytes. For PSC-less animals, UAS-Hid females were crossed with Collier-GAL4/CyO y+ males.

Dissections were typically done one-to-two days after infection. Uninfected controls followed the same timeline. In general, longer infection regimes led to stronger responses: more lamellocytes differentiated after Lb infection and more lobe cells were lost after Lh infection.
