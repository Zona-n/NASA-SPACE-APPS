For microbes that accompany humans into space, microgravity-induced alterations in the fluid environment are likely to be a major factor in the microbial experience of spaceflight. Computational modeling is needed to investigate how well ground-based microgravity simulation methods replicate that experience. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to study inter-species metabolite transport within microbial communities in rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). Preexisting CFD modeling of RWVs has not yet incorporated growth; CAMDLES employs the simultaneous modeling of biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a micro-scale rotating reference frame environment. Simulation mass transfer calculations were correlated with Monod dynamic parameters to predict relative growth rates between artificial microgravity, spaceflight microgravity, and 1 g conditions. By simulating a microbial model community of metabolically cooperative strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, we found that the greatest difference between microgravity and an RWV or 1 g gravity was when species colocalized in dense aggregates. We also investigated the influence of other features of the system on growth, such as spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity. Our simulation provides a basis for future laboratory experiments using this community for investigation in artificial microgravity and spaceflight microgravity. More broadly, our development of these models creates a framework for novel hypothesis generation and design of biological experiments with RWVs, coupling the effects of RWV size, rotation rate, and mass transport directly to bacterial growth in microbial communities.",

Like all organisms, microbes experience stress in the space environment: studies have documented changes in virulence, antimicrobial resistance, and population diversity. However, the mechanisms by which spaceflight induces these responses remain poorly understood. Many of the processes documented for multicellular organisms, such as mitochondrial dysregulation and mechanical unloading, do not apply to single-celled organisms; moreover, microorganisms almost invariably live in communities, but few studies of any organisms at any scale have investigated the effects of space conditions on interspecies interactions. Understanding the microbial space response requires an approach that considers the interactions between microbial cells and their environments at relevant spatial scales.",

It is also the feature most difficult to replicate in ground studies. Since spaceflight experiments are costly, logistically difficult, and inaccessible to many researchers, artificial microgravity devices, such as clinostats and rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, are commonly used to replicate microgravity conditions. An RWV is a type of clinostat that is used for cell culture: they are cylindrical culture vessels filled with liquid culture medium that constantly rotate the fluid environment, keeping cells in suspension by continuously changing the orientation of the gravity vector. However, there is a fundamental difference between microbial cells and larger organisms in the way that rotation is used to simulate microgravity. For plants grown in clinostats, the constant rotation of the gravity vector results in an average gravity vector of zero over time. For microbial cells, which are believed to be unable to sense gravity directly, it is the ability of the RWV to mimic the unique fluid environment of microgravity that is likely its most important feature. Understanding the fluid dynamics of the RWV is therefore critical for conducting rigorous research into the effects of spaceflight on microorganisms.",

Likewise, the idealized RWV fluid environment is under solid-body rotation, with minimal fluid shear and turbulence. However, a disparity is observed in the cellular response when comparing RWV and microgravity conditions, which may be caused by a complex set of factors, including hardware effects, mechanotransduction, and nutrient stress. RWVs also exhibit centrifugal sedimentation of cell aggregates, resulting in localization that is different from that found in true microgravity. There are very few commercially available bioreactors; therefore, they are often custom-designed by researchers and unique to each researcher’s experiment. A general lack of knowledge about accurate RWV conditions is a problem that may be one of the sources of contradictory conclusions about the effect of microgravity among cell biological circles, assuming there even is a unified microgravity response on bacterial cells at all.",

No microbial species lives in isolation. Microorganisms form communities in which different species interact in numerous ways, and one of the interactions most commonly documented is the exchange of metabolites used for growth, often called cross-feeding. In a quiescent microgravity fluid environment, reduced mixing could lead to a reduced exchange of metabolites, which, in turn, would shift community dynamics. Although a few microbial community experiments have been done in artificial microgravity, there are no previous studies that attempt to validate computational models for a quantitative understanding of microbial community dynamics in these devices. Numerous computational fluid dynamics studies on the macro-scale have been done to validate the ability of clinostats and RWV’s to produce the desired quiescent fluidic environment, but the scope of these studies often includes the fluid phase only, or solid parcel fractions, without metabolite scalar transport. We sought to fill this gap by building a computational model that integrates both fluid and particle dynamics with biological metabolism and growth to generate predictions of microbial community dynamics in 1 g, microgravity, and RWV conditions. As an initial demonstration, we modeled a community composed of two obligately cross-feeding bacterial species that were previously studied and modeled extensively.",

We also tested random cell placements distributed throughout the computational domain, as well as a cylindrical colony formation as an approximation of a biofilm shape in the case of 1 g gravity. Periodic boundary conditions were set for the non-radial boundaries. In the radial direction, the outer wall was set as an inlet with zero velocity, and the inner wall was a freestream outlet. Cell metabolism was kickstarted by giving each species cell equivalents of product for the other species, i.e., E. coli was given acetate, and S. enterica was given methionine. This is similar to previous studies with this system using modeling with ordinary differential equations and is necessary to enable growth at initial timepoints. In simulations with higher initial cell populations, we gave less starting product, ranging from 10−2 cell equivalents during inoculation, to 10−8 at maximum population. After initialization, each case study ran for two to five minutes, assuming cell growth to be exponential during this time. ",

We tested a counterexample with both 100-cell and 283-cell spherical-Gaussian-packed colonies and found their steady growth rate to be hindered by ~10% compared to a randomly distributed simulation placement (Table S2), likely due to spatial interference for diffusion or Monod competition for metabolites.

We found that when the cells were randomly distributed, hydrodynamics only slightly affected RWV growth rates (29% of μmax) relative to true microgravity (27% of μmax). The slight increase was caused by metabolite convective transfer coefficients increasing to 1.17 × 10−3 m/s from 1.06 × 10−3 m/s. However, when the cells were clumped, complicated hydrodynamic effects modulated the growth dynamics and resulted in very different growth between true microgravity and an RWV.

The product yield parameter λx expresses the amount, in cell equivalents, of resource x produced during the growth of the producing species, and the ratio between λS and λE influences both the species ratio and the growth rate of the consortium. We found that the advantage of an RWV over microgravity in terms of growth rate decreased as the product yields increased (Figure 9).

Several contrasts are worth noting. CAMDLES assumes that the internal metabolism time is negligible compared to the time for metabolites to transfer throughout liquid media, and thus we effectively linearized the Monod kinetics equation. Importantly, this approximation is more accurate the lower the diffusivity of metabolites.

Higher growth rates then only occurred when cells aggregated into either a densely packed biofilm or a loose spherical aggregate. These results parallel observations showing that bacteria can exhibit a planktonic/biofilm transition at a critical point, and hint that future CAMDLES studies could offer insight into growth strategies underlying multispecies biofilm formation.

At a certain point, an ECM reduces diffusion and limits growth rates, and thus the colony size, of solid-spherical biofilms. In CAMDLES, this occurs at a colony size of around 500–1000 cells. Thus, we expect that if colonies form solid aggregates, we will see them most commonly at this size in microgravity and RWVs.",

In contrast to agar plates, where single-species colonies can support each other at a distance, multi-species colonies are necessary for metabolite exchange in liquid media in all three conditions tested (RWV, microgravity, 1 g). One potential explanation concerned two disadvantages: single-species colonies exhibit both the poor diffusive transport that cells in a planktonic culture experience and the intra-colony competition for metabolites that cells in dense communities experience. Yet, CAMDLES simulations do not resolve the long-term spatiotemporal effects of an RWV and 1 g for these scenarios. The long-term effect is simplest in a quiescent environment of microgravity, but interactions between multiple colonies would be more complicated in an RWV sedimenting environment.",

            "text": "Overall, we observed that the differences between microgravity and artificial microgravity originated primarily from increased mass transfer caused by RWV convective flows and sedimentation. Even though convection fluid currents may be negligible in 1 g and RWVs, the increased mass transfer coefficient of cells  resulted in a 9% reduction in the Monod half-saturation constant . The spatiotemporal dynamics and substrate utilization of the colony itself were changed by the  change in both species. However, these mass transfer coefficient increases were minor in comparison to those that would result from Brownian motion if it were implemented, which is significantly more rapid than RWV sedimentation. On the other hand, it is limited in the case of solid biofilms; therefore, we can assert that solid biofilms are more accurately simulated in CAMDLES. Generally, if Brownian motion and cell motility were included in the simulation, we would likely observe a reduction in the relative difference between microgravity and RWV growth rates, and an overall reduction in growth rates due to long-term biomass dispersion throughout the simulation domain.",

Added features, such as Brownian motion, bacterial motility, and more complex metabolic cell models, would also add computational overhead.

Although not tested in this study, the size and rotation rate of the RWV balance these two factors, and in future work, CAMDLES could be used to explore these experimental variables. Ultimately, the RWV effect on population growth rate is unclear and specific to the microbial community of study. Thus, our package has the potential to serve as a basis to demystify the inconsistencies seen in microbial communities between RWVs and microgravity. This first implementation of CAMDLES serves to demonstrate the importance of a microbial cell’s immediate physical environment on population- and community-level behaviors, especially in the space environment, and in experiments meant to simulate the space environment. CAMDLES represents the type of computational tool capable of providing biologists with unprecedented insight into those interacting physical, chemical, and biological processes.",
