***Brickonaut — Space Bioscience Explorer***

🏆 NASA Space Apps Chicago 2025 — Panel 2: Storytelling Winners

Brickonaut is an interactive AI dashboard that transforms how NASA’s bioscience research can be explored. It helps scientists, managers, and mission architects discover how living systems adapt to life beyond Earth — piece by piece, just like building with Legos.

🌌 **Overview**

NASA has performed hundreds of biology experiments in space, generating a massive amount of data and publications. However, this information is often difficult to navigate. Brickonaut was built to solve that challenge.

Our tool uses AI and knowledge graphs to summarize insights from over 600 NASA bioscience publications, allowing users to:

Search semantically across studies

Visualize research trends and consensus

Identify knowledge gaps and propose future experiments

The interface is inspired by Lego, Chicago’s design spirit, and NASA’s mission for discovery — blending clarity, creativity, and curiosity.


🧠 **Features**

🔍 Semantic Search — Find related studies by topic, organism, or condition.

🪐 Evidence Cards — Extract and summarize key results with citations.

📊 Consensus Meter — Visualize agreement or disagreement across studies.

🌱 Gap Map — Identify underexplored research areas.

🧭 Persona Dashboards —

Scientist: Generate hypotheses and compare results.

Manager: Spot funding opportunities and progress.

Mission Architect: Plan safe human exploration using biological data.
